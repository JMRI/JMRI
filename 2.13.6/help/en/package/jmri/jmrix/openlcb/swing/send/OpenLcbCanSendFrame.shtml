The "Send OpenLCB Frame" tool lets you
directly send 
<a href="../../../../../../html/hardware/can/index.shtml">CAN frames</a>,
and certain kinds of OpenLCB messages.

<p>It works best in combination with the 
"Show Raw Data" option in the monitor window, 
because packets are entered here in raw hexadecimal format.

<p>
The top section of the window lets you send a single frame.
Just type the packet's data contents as 
hexadecimal numbers, for example "83 7C". If you want to specify
header contents, preceed the packet data with the header in 
"()" characters or "[]" characters for a standard or extended header, 
respectively. (OpenLCB uses only extended headers, but we
make it possible to send both so you can experiment).
Once you've entered the packet, just click "send".
<p>
The second section lets you enter from one to four frames
that will be repeatedly sent in sequence, with user-defined delays in between.
Press the "Go" button to start the transmission sequence, and press it again
to stop the sequence.

<p>
Below that are sections for sending various OpenLCB messages. 

<p>
Under "Send special frame", the "Send CIM" button formats up a 
"CIM" frame from the source node alias that you provide and then sends it.
This is part of the OpenLCB technique for allocating node aliases.

<p>
In the "Send OpenLCB message" section, you can 
format and send frames that contains specific OpenLCB messages:
<ul>
<li>"Send Verify Node": Using the source alias 
you provided in the upper section
and a node ID specified here, this sends a request for a verification 
reply from the node.

<li>"Send Request Events": Using the source alias you provided in the upper section
and a node ID specified here, this sends a request for infomration
on the nodes produced and consumed by the node.

<li>"Send Request Consumers": Using the source alias you provided in the upper section
and an event ID specified here, this sends a request for a reply from any
node that consumes that event ID.

<li>"Send Request Producers": Using the source alias you provided in the upper section
and an event ID specified here, this sends a request for a reply from any
node that produces that event ID.

<li>"Send Event Produced": Using the source alias you provided in the upper section
and an event ID specified here, this sends an announcement that the given event
has been produced.

<li>"Send Datagram": Using the source alias and destination alias
you provided in the upper section
and data bytes you provide here,
this sends a datagram to the destination node.
The "Send Confirm" button sends a confirmation reply to any datagram received.

</ul>

<p>
In the "Send OpenLCB configuration command" section, you can 
use the OpenLCB configuration protocol to read and write from
node memory.  Set your source node alias and the destination node
alias in the "Send special frame" section above.
<p>
Next select the memory address to start reading or writing at, and
which address space you'd like to read or write from.
(Configuration Definition Information, etc).

<p>
Then, either enter the desired number of bytes and click Read, 
or
the data to write (two bytes in this implementation) and push "Write".

<p>
"Send Confirm" sends the confirmation to any datagrams you receive in reply.

</ul>
