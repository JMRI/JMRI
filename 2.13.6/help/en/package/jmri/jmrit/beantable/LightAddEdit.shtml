<H1>Adding/Editing Lights</H1>


<a name="addLight"><H2>Adding a new Light</H2></a>
To add a new Light, follow this procedure:
<ol>
	<li><p>Click <b>Lights</b> in the <b>Tables</b> submenu of the 
<b>Tools</b> menu to bring up
the <b><a href="Lights.shtml">Light Table</a></b>, and click the 
<b>Add...</b> button at the bottom of the <b>Light Table</b> to bring up 
the "Add" version of the <b>Add/Edit Light</b> window.</p>
<img src="LightAddFrame.jpg" height="399" width="575">
	<li><p>Select a <b>System:</b> if your layout is connected to more 
than one system or if creating an internal Light. Next enter the 
<b>Hardware Address:</b> of your new Light (usually a number). This is 
the address JMRI will send to your system when switching the Light. 
From this information, the program will make a <b>System Name</b> in the 
JMRI convention, appropriate for a Light in the selected System using 
the entered address. Examples of valid System Names are: CL1004, and LL401, 
assuming you have the hardware for the addressed digital output bits.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Enter a user name. Any string of characters that is different 
from the user name of other Lights will be accepted, but it's 
wise to use a string that describes the intended use of the Light. Entry 
of a user name is optional.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>If you wish to enter a control for your new Light, click the 
<b>Add Control</b> button, and enter your choices into the 
<b>Add/Edit Light Control</b> window which appears. You may enter as many 
Light Controls as desired. More information on Light Controls is 
<A HREF="#lightcontrol">below</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Each Light Control is displayed in the Light Control table.
The <b>Control Type</b> is shown on the left, followed by a <b>Description</b> 
of the Control mechanism.  These are followed by <b>Edit</b> and a <b>Delete</b> 
buttons. Click <b>Edit</b> to bring back the <b>Add/Edit Light Control</b> 
window allowing changes to the control specification. Click <b>Delete</b> 
to remove a Light Control.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Next is the notes area of the Add/Edit Light window.  This is 
where instructions and error messages will appear as you create or edit 
a Light. Always check this area to see if things went as expected.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the window.  
If everything is fine, a message stating "New Light added ... " will be 
displayed in the notes area. If there is trouble with anything, an error or 
warning message will be displayed in the notes area; you should then
correct the error and click <b>Create</b> again.</p>
<p> -OR- </p>
<p>Click the <b>Cancel</b> button to dismiss the window without creating any 
more Lights.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="addLight"><H2>Adding several new Lights at Once</H2></a>
If the selected <b>System:</b> supports adding multiple Lights at once, 
the <b>Add/Edit Light</b> window will display two additional items, as shown 
below: </p>
<p><img src="LightAddManyFrame.jpg" height="399" width="575"></p>
<p>Adding several new Lights at once is optional. If you only want to add one 
new Light, ignore the <b>Add a sequential range</b> check box and the 
<b>Number to Add:</b> entry.  If you want to add several new Lights with 
sequential hardware addresses, click the <b>Add a sequential range</b> check box. 
When this box is checked, the <b>Number to Add:</b> entry is active. Enter the 
number of sequential entries you want to add.  Enter other items for the first 
Light, following the procedure above, and click the Create button. If any of the 
requested addresses are not available (previously assigned to a Light or a 
Turnout), a message will appear in the notes area, and no new Lights will be 
created. If everything checks out, the requested Lights will be created, and a 
message will appear in the notes area</p>
<p>Adding multiple Lights at once is intended to support stationary decoders 
which require several addresses in sequence. As a result, restrictions 
apply when creating several Lights at once. Note the following:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>The addresses must be numerical--only numbers are allowed in the 
	hardware address.</p></li>
	<li><p>The addresses of the created Lights must be consecutive.</p></li>
	<li><p>All requested addresses must be available, i.e., not currently 
	assigned to a Light or Turnout.</p></li>
	<li><p>If a user name is entered, each of the created Lights will have 
	that user name with "+1", "+2", etc. appended.</p></li>
	<li><p>Entered Light Control items and Variable Intensity items will be 
	assigned to the first Light created, and not to subsequent Lights. These 
	items may be added by Editing (see below).</p></li>
	</ul>

<h2>Editing an existing Light</h2>
To edit an existing Light, follow  this procedure:
<ol>
	<li><p>To Edit of an existing Light click on a Light's <b>Edit</b> button 
in the <a href="LightTable.shtml">Light Table</a> to bring up 
the "Edit" version of the <b>Add/Edit Light</b> window.</p>
<img src="LightEditWindow.jpg" height="361" width="575">
	</li>
	<li><p>The <b>System Name:</b> of the Light is displayed at the top of 
	the window and cannot be changed. The <b>User Name:</b> may be changed 
	either here or in the Light Table. The Light Control and notes areas 
	are the same as above.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>After making changes to the Light information, click <b>Update</b> 
	to change the selected Light. If there is any trouble, an error or 
	warning message will be displayed in the notes area, and the update is 
	stopped for you to correct the error and click <b>Update</b> again. If 
	all is fine, the Light is changed and the <b>Add/Edit Light</b> window 
	is dismissed.</p>
	<p>-OR-</p>
	<p>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit edit mode without changing the 
	selected Light. If the <b>Add/Edit Light</b> window is dismissed (closed) 
	while in edit mode, <b>Cancel</b> is automatically selected, and no 
	changes are made to the selected Light.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="lightcontrol"><H2>Automated Control Options for Lights</H2></a>

<p> The <b>Add/Edit Light Control</b> window is used to specify a Light control. 
The operation of a Light can be controlled in the following ways:
	<ul>
	<li><p><b>By Sensor</b> - The Light will be turned <b>ON</b> when the sensor
	changes to active or inactive, depending upon the choice made in the 
	<b>Sense for ON</b> popup menu, and it will be turned <b>OFF</b>, when the 
	sensor reverses state.  Specify the sensor by entering its name 
	(system name or user name) in the <b>Sensor Name</b> field. This option has 
	a number of uses, including setting a fascia panel light to follow block
	occupancy. That is useful, for example, for monitoring train position in
	a hidden staging area.</p>
	<img src="LightAddFrameSensor.jpg" height="179" width="240">
	</li>
	<li><p><b>By Fast Clock</b> - The Light will be turned <b>ON</b> when the fast
	clock reaches the time entered in <b>Time On</b> and will be turned <b>OFF</b> 
	when the fast clock reaches the time entered in <b>Time Off</b>.  The times 
	are entered in "hh:mm" format, where "hh" is hours and "mm" is  minutes for a
	24-hour clock. One use of this option is to turn on and off scenery 
	lighting, street lights, house lights, etc. to simulate night time on the 
	layout. </p>
	<img src="LightAddFastClock.jpg" height="174" width="240">
	</li>
	<li><p><b>By Turnout Status</b> - The Light will be turned <b>ON</b> when the 
	turnout changes to closed or thrown, depending upon the choice made in the 
	<b>Status for ON</b> popup menu, and it will be turned <b>OFF</b>, when the turnout
	reverses its status.  Specify the turnout by entering its name 
	(system name or user name) in the <b>Turnout Name</b> field. This option may 
	be used to set a fascia panel light to follow the status of a turnout. 
	That is useful, for example, for monitoring the status of hidden turnouts.
	</p>
	<img src="LightAddFrameTurnout.jpg" height="179" width="240">
	</li>
	<li><p><b>By Timed ON</b> - The Light will be turned <b>ON</b> when the trigger
	sensor changes to active, and it will be turned <b>OFF</b>, when the specified 
	time has elapsed. Specify the trigger sensor by entering its name 
	(system name or user name) in the <b>Trigger Sensor Name</b> field. Enter
	the time the Light is to remain on (in milliseconds) in the <b>Duration ON</b>
	field. This option has a number of uses, it was originally designed to 
	turn on an electromagnetic decoupler in response to a fascia pushbutton, 
	but it can also be used for other types of layout animation, for example, 
	to control the ringing of a crossing bell when a train enters a block.</p>
	<img src="LightAddFrameTimed.jpg" height="174" width="263">
	</li>
	<li><p><b>By Two Sensors</b> - The Light will be turned <b>ON</b> when the 
	either of the two sensors changes to active or inactive, depending upon the 
	choice made in the <b>Sense for ON</b> popup menu, and it will be turned 
	<b>OFF</b>, when both of the two sensors are in the reverse state.
	Specify each sensor by entering its name (system name or user name) in 
	the <b>Sensor Name</b> field. The order of entry does not matter. This option 
	has multiple uses, such as controlling crossing gates with point sensors that 
	detect when a train passes. By placing two point sensors, one at each end 
	of a bridge, a layout sound for a bridge rumble may be played while the train 
	is traversing the bridge.</p>
	<img src="LightAddTwoSensor.jpg" height="179" width="333">
	</li>
	</ul>
<a name="cautions"><H2>Light Control Cautions</H2></a>
<ul>
	<li><p>If you need to enter a sensor name or a turnout name, you must enter the name 
	(system name or user name) of an existing sensor or turnout. The sensor or 
	turnout must be in the Sensor Table or the Turnout Table.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>If you enter a user name to specify a sensor or a turnout, be very 
	careful about changing the user name of your sensor or turnout. A simple 
	change of user name could break your Light control definitions.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>If you enter multiple Light controls for the same Light, it is possible 
	that the Light controls might conflict or overlap with each other, producing 
	strange results. <b>The user is responsible for ensuring that Light controls 
	do not conflict.</b></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<a name="varLight"><H2>Working with Variable Intensity Lights</H2></a>
If the selected <b>System:</b> supports Lights with variable intensity, 
the <b>Add/Edit Light</b> window will display the <b>Variable Intensity</b> 
area shown below when adding a Light: </p>
<p><img src="LightAddVariable.jpg" height="445" width="575"></p>
<p>Systems, like PowerLine, that support variable intensity lights also 
support lights with fixed intensity. If you are adding a Light with fixed 
intensity, i.e. an ON/OFF light, ignore the items in the <b>Variable 
Intensity</b> area. When editing a simple ON/OFF light, the items in the 
<b>Variable Intensity</b> area are not relevant, and are not displayed.</p>
<p>The intensity of a Light is represented internally by the range from 0.0 
to 1.0, with 1.0 being brightest. Intensity limits are entered as percentages, 
from 0 through 100, in the Minimum Intensity and Maximum Intensity fields. 
Because the actual light hardware has only finite resolution, the intensity 
value is mapped to the nearest supported setting.</p>
<p>Each Light has a <b>Target Intensity</b> property which can be set directly. 
Attempting to set the <b>Target Intensity</b> outside the <b>Minimum 
Intensity to Maximum Intensity</b> range will result in the <b>Target 
Intensity</b> being set to the relevant limit.</p>
