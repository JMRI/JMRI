<H1>The LRoute Table</H1>

<P>An LRoute is a more generalized version of a Route implemented as a Logix.
It is intended for use in situations where additional triggers or actions are
desired beyond the capabilities of Routes.  It can be used as a starting point for
creating new Logix.  The LRoute table provides pick lists of Sensors, Turnouts, 
Lights and Signalheads from which output actions and trigger conditions can be 
choosen.</p>

<P>Once you have some turnouts, sensors, signalheads and/or lights to manage, use 
the <b>Add</b> button in the lower left hand corner of the LRoute Table to
create a new logix route.  After you have created a logix route, you may add additional 
capabilities by editing it from the Logix Table.</p>

<p>The Logix that implements the l-route has its system name prefixed with "RTX".
All Logix with this prefix are displayed in the LRoute Table.  Please note that an
"RTX" Logix that has had capabilities added with 
Logix editing may not be able to display
these addtional capabilities for LRoute editing.  Once Logix editing is done to an
l-route, it is recommended that further editing be done from the Logix Table.</p>
