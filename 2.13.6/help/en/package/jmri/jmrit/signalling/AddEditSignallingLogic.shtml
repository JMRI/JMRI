<H1><A NAME="Adding/Editing Routes"></A>Adding/Editing Signal Mast Logics</H1>

<P>The first thing you must do when creating a Signal Mast logic is to select the
source followed by the destination Signal masts.  The source signal mast is one 
which you wish to control at set the appearances on.  The destination signal mast 
is the next signal mast down the line, the appearance of the destination mast 
along with the state of the turnouts and blocks will have a direct effect on the 
appearance of the source signal mast.<br>
If you are not using the Layout Editor, then NO validation is performed of the 
source and destination mast.  If the layout editor is being used, 
then the system will try and determine if the destination mast is reachable from 
the source mast.
</P>
<P><b>In Edit Mode Only</b> The maximum permissable path speed between the 
two signalmast is displayed, this is determined by the speeds configured against 
the blocks and turnout.</p>
<P>The check box "Use Layout Editor Paths" allows 
you to get the system to automatically generate the required blocks, turnout and 
signal masts along with their states that are located between the source and 
destination signal masts.<br>
On selecting "Using Layout Editor Paths", two further check boxs will appear,
"Use Turnout Details From Layout Editor" and "Use Block Details From Layout Editor" 
Selecting either of these will determine what information from the layout editor 
is used when the system automatically generates the route.<br>
The automatically generated information is not saved with the panel file, this 
information is generated each time the layout panel is opened.<br>
If the information on the layout editor panel is edited, the change is not 
reflected in the SignalMast Logic, you will need to store the panel, close JMRI 
and re-open the panel for the Logic to be updated.</P>
<P>
The "Allow The Logic to Automatically Determine Conflicting SignalMast" option 
tries to determine which signals could possibly cause a conflicting route 
if they were not set to danger.</P>
<P>
The "Lock Turnouts when Signal Mast Logic is Active" feature allows you to 
selectively disable
accessory (turnouts) commands from cabs and/or locally-wired pushbuttons. JMRI
disables pushbuttons by sending pushbutton disable commands to the
turnout decoders when the route is locked, and enables the pushbuttons
when the route is unlocked. When locking a turnout from cab commands,
the JMRI program will monitor the turnout's accessory address and if it
detects a change command from a cab, will cancel the command immediately
by sending out the opposite command to the turnout. All turnouts that
are being monitored by the JMRI program and are included in the route
will be locked.</P>


<P>The radio button below the "Lock Turnout when Signal Mast Logic is Active" 
allows you to show only the turnouts, sensors, blocks or signal masts 
that are part of this signal mast logic. </p>
 <p>
There four tabs below the "Show" button, each contains the details of Blocks, 
turnouts, sensors and signalmasts that make up the Signalmast logic.
In each of these tab, there is an editable table that allows you to manually 
select which item should be included in the Signal Mast logic and the state 
which this item should be in.<br>
Below that is a further table that shows the automatically generated items 
(except in the sensor tab).  Manually entered items over-ride the automatically
generated items, therefore if you wish to over-ride any item in automatically
generated list then in the manual table select the corresponding item and 
set the state.

Click the "Include" box in any of the tables to add the desired item to your 
signalmast logic. Next to the "Include" box
is the state option which that item must be in for the Signal Mast to come active. 
For example, if you wish the turnout to be in a thrown state to trigger the 
logic, then select "Thrown" in the drop down box.  If you wish to over-ride a 
turnout that has automatically included, and you don't care what state it is 
set to, select "Any State" from the drop down box.</P>

<P>Update Signal Mast Logic</P>
This will add or update your Signal Mast Logic to the system, once added, the 
tables holding the automatic generated data will then be re-populated.
