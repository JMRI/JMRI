<h3>What are 
Routes?</h3>

<p>Routes are collections of Turnouts and/or Sensors whose states may be 
set all at once. Also when a Route is triggered, a sound may be played, 
or a script may be run. For example, a Route may be set up to clear all 
turnouts on a mainline with one computer or fascia panel button. 
Routes may also be set up to control the setting of ladders of 
turnouts in staging areas or yards.  Another use is to set layout 
turnouts to default positions when beginning an operating session. 
JMRI Routes are similar to the routes implemented in the Digitrax 
Chief system, except the JMRI Routes can mix turnouts controlled by 
different hardware systems, and also can set sensors, play a sound, or 
run a script.</p>
<p>Optionally a Route may be controlled by up to three sensors and/or by
a control turnout. When a Route is created, or when it is read from a 
configuration file, the Route is 'activated'; it is set up
to monitor automatically any changes in state of its control sensors 
and/or control turnout. When the controlling sensors or turnout change
in the user-specified way, the Route is 'set' ('triggered'); included 
turnouts and included sensors are set as specified, and if 
specified, a sound is played or a script is run.</p>
<p>The Route Table contains an 'Enabled' column. For a Route to be 
triggered by its control sensors or its control turnout,
it must be "enabled", that is its check box in the 'Enabled' column
must be checked.  You can uncheck this box to temporarily disable a 
Route from being triggered, i.e. prevent it from setting its turnouts, 
sensors, etc. when a control sensor or control turnout changes.</p>

<h3>How to setup for adding or editing Routes:</h3>

<p>First make sure the Turnout Table contains all turnouts 
involved in the Routes to be defined, and that the Sensor Table 
contains all sensors needed.  Then select <b>Tools>Route Table</b>, 
and click the <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom of the table to 
bring up the Add/Edit Route window.</p>

<a name="addroute"><H3>To add a new Route:</H3></a>

<ol>
	<li><p>Enter a system name, such as 'IR100'--any 
short name can be used provided it is different from the system 
name of other Routes.</p>
	<p>By convention, system names usually start with "IR" for Internal 
Route. </p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Enter a user name. Any string of characters that is different 
from the user name of other Routes will be accepted, but it's 
wise to use a string that describes the intended use of the Route.</p>
	<p>Note that before JMRI version 1.5.6, there was a bug that 
prevented you from having more than one blank user name.  In more 
recent versions, you can have as many Routes with blank user names 
as you'd like; these have to be referenced via their system names, 
of course.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Select turnouts to be included in the new 
Route in the list of all defined turnouts, by clicking on the 
checkbox in the <b>Include</b> column. For each included turnout, 
use the combo box in the <b>Set State</b> column to select whether 
that included turnout is to be 'Set Closed', 'Set Thrown' or 
'Toggle'd when the Route is 'Set'. Don't worry if everything isn't 
perfect. It's easy to edit this information later. </p>
	<p>Note that the Add/Edit Route window allows you to display 
'All' Turnouts and Sensors or 'Included' Turnouts and Sensors. This 
is only for your convenience in checking that all desired turnouts 
and/or sensors have been included; it does not affect entered 
information.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Similarly, select sensors to be included in the new 
Route in the list of all defined sensors, by clicking on the 
checkbox in the <b>Include</b> column. For each included sensor, 
use the combo box in the <b>Set State</b> column to select whether 
that sensor is to be 'Set Active', 'Set Inactive' or 'Toggle'd 
when the Route is 'Set'. </p> 
	</li>
	<li><p>If you want the Route to play a sound when it triggers,
enter the file name of a sound file in the text box following 'Play
sound file'.  Clicking <b>Set</b> will bring up a file selection 
dialog to help locate the file. Once the file is located, clicking 
on its name in the dialog will copy it, complete with path, into
the text box.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Similarly if you want a script to be run when the Route
triggers, enter its file name into the text box on the right.  The 
<b>Set</b> button can be used as above to assist in entering 
script file information.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>If you want the setting of the Route to be controlled 
by one or more input sensors, enter their names (system name or user name) 
and select what kind of logic they'll obey.  Logic choices are described in 
detail <A HREF="#sensorlogic">below</a>. </p>
<P>When you save and restore your Routes using a configuration file,
the sensor name you enter here is used to recreate the route.
A system name will always be associated with the same input Sensor.
A user name can be moved to another input by changing the entries 
in the Sensor table. For example, "East OS Occupancy" could be
changed from LocoNet sensor input LS12 to LS24 by just associating
that user name with a different system name; this makes layout rewiring
easy.  User names entered here must exist however; if you change the
sensor's user name from "East OS Occupancy" to "East Occupancy", the route
won't load properly until you edit it to use the new name.
</p>
	</li> 
	<li><p>Also optional, if you want to enable setting of 
the Route when a particular turnout changes state, enter a 
turnout name (system name or user name) and select the logic that it 
will obey. Logic choices are explained in detail 
<A HREF="#turnoutlogic">below</a>. </p>
<P>When you save and restore your Routes using a configuration file,
the turnout name you enter here is used to recreate the route.
A system name will always be associated with the same turnout.
A user name can be moved to another turnout by changing the entries 
in the Turnout table. For example, "Set Track 5" could be
changed from LocoNet sensor turnout 105 to turnout 5 by just associating
that user name with a different system name; this makes layout rewiring
easy.  User names entered here must exist however; if you change the
turnout's user name from "Set Track 5" to "Set Trk 5", the route
won't load properly until you edit it to use the new name.
</p>

 	</li>
 	<li>
 	<p>The "Added delay" entry is normally left at "0". When a
 Route sets it turnouts, it waits 250 milliseconds between 
 turnout control commands.  If this is not enough time between 
 commands for your type of turnout control, you can increase the 
 time between commands by entering an added delay (in milliseconds).
 </p>
	<li><p>Click the <b>Add Route</b> button at 
the bottom of the window.  If everything is fine, a message 
stating "New Route added ... " will be displayed in the notes box 
near the bottom of the window.  If there is trouble with anything, 
an error message will be displayed in the notes box; you should then
correct the error and click <b>Add Route</b> again.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>To edit an existing Route:</h3>

<ol>
 
	<li>Edit of an existing Route may be started in either of two ways:
		<ul>
		<li> Click on a Route's <b>Edit</b> button in the Route Table.</li>
		<li> Enter the system name of the Route to be edited in the 
		Add/Edit Route window and click the <b>Edit Route</b> button at 
		the bottom of the Add/Edit Route window.  This must be the same 
		as the system name shown in the Route Table.</li>
		</ul>
	The <b>Add Route</b> and <b>Edit Route</b> buttons in the 
	Add/Edit Route window will change to 
	<b>Update Route</b> and <b>Cancel</b>.</li>
	<li> Make whatever changes or additions you need to the information in
	the dialog. Note that the system name of the edited Route may not be 
	changed, but the user name may be changed. Other items are as described 
	<A HREF="#addroute">above</a>.</li>
	<li>After making changes to the Route information, click <b>Update 
	Route</b> to change the selected Route.  If everything is fine, a 
	message stating "Route updated ... " will be displayed in the notes 
	box near the bottom of the window.  If there is any trouble, an error
	message will be displayed in the notes box, and the update is stopped
	for you to correct the error and click <b>Update Route</b> again.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit edit mode without changing the 
	selected Route.  If the Add/Edit Route window is dismissed (closed) 
	while in edit mode, <b>Cancel</b> is automatically selected, and no 
	changes are made to the selected Route.</li>
</ol>


<h3>To set (trigger) a Route:</h3>

<p>Routes may be 'set' by clicking the <b>Set</b> button in the State 
column of the Route Table. A Route may also be set by fascia panel buttons 
if sensors for these buttons are defined as control sensors in the Route 
information. If a control turnout is defined in the Route information, throwing 
or closing that turnout from your physical throttle will also trigger the Route.  
Note that 
control turnouts may be real turnouts, phantom turnouts, or internal turnouts 
as described <A HREF="#turnoutlogic">below</a>.  A Route may also be triggered 
from a Logix, as the action of one of its conditionals.  If you need more
powerful logic to control your Route than a provided by the Route itself, 
consider using a 
<a href="Logix.shtml">Logix</a>.</p>

<p>Note that enabled/disabled and 'veto' logic discussed below for control 
<A HREF="#sensorlogic">sensors</a> and for the control 
<A HREF="#turnoutlogic">turnout</a> apply only to a Route's automated
control mechanism.  Neither 'disabled' nor 'veto' logic will prevent a Route
from being set (triggered) using the <b>Set</b> button or from a Logix.</p>

<p>It's also useful to note that when a Route has been triggered and is actively 
sending commands to turnouts the Route is marked as busy until this operation is
complete. A Route cannot be triggered again while it is busy, i.e. until its
current operation is complete.

<h3>To save Routes to disk:</h3>

<p>Routes are saved in your 
layout configuration file, along with turnouts, sensors, signal 
heads, lights, etc.  To store this information on disk, use <b>Store 
Configuration...</b> in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Route 
Table (or other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b>
in the <b>Panel</b> menu. Note that the enabled/disabled state of each Route
is not saved in the configuration file.  When Routes are loaded from a
configuration file, they are all enabled.

<a name="sensorlogic"><H3>Controlling Routes from Sensors</H3></a>

The operation of a Route can be controlled by up to three
sensors.  These can be connected to occupancy detectors or 
switches on the layout, or even just used to operate the Route 
from a control panel on the computer.  These sensors can be real 
sensors or internal sensors.
<P>
By default, when any one of the 
defined sensors goes to the active state, the Route will be set. 
This could be used to e.g. set a Route when a block became occupied, 
or when a button was pushed.
<P>
More powerful logic can also do things like "define 
Routes to have the position of a turnout follow the position of a 
panel switch".  For this, each of the three Sensors has a "mode" 
associated with it, which can be:
<DL>
<DT>"On Active"</DT><DD>The default method, the Route is triggered when 
the sensor goes active, e.g. "Throw turnout 12 when sensor 12 goes 
active"</DD>

<DT>"On Inactive"</DT><DD>The Route is triggered when the sensor goes 
inactive.   For example, using the Route above, plus a second Route 
"Close turnout 12 when sensor 12 goes inactive" will have turnout 12 
follow a panel switch connected to sensor 12 as it is flipped back and 
forth.</DD>

<DT>"On Change"</DT><DD>The Route is triggered when the sensor state
changes, either from active to inactive or from inactive to active.</DD>

<DT>"Veto Active"</DT><DD>If this sensor is active, other sensors set 
to "On Active", "On Inactive" "On Change" will be ignored, and a
control turnout set to "On Closed", "On Thrown", or "On Change" will 
also be ignored. This has several uses, e.g. to prevent throwing a 
turnout under a train when the block shows occupied.</DD>

<DT>"Veto Inactive"</DT><DD>Like veto active, but the other polarity 
logic.</DD>

</DL>
<p>Note that there is an implied "and/or" here.  All of the 'veto' 
sensors and the 'veto' turnout, if there is one, must be in their 
non-veto state _and_ at least one of the triggering sensors or a  
triggering turnout must see the appropriate change for the 
Route to be set.</p>    

<a name="turnoutlogic"><H3>Controlling Routes from a Turnout</H3></a>
<p>The setting (triggering) of a Route can be controlled from a turnout. 
This turnout can be a real physical turnout, a 'phantom' turnout (a DCC 
turnout number with no corresponding physical turnout), or 
an 'internal' turnout.</p>  
	    <UL>
	    <LI>If a real turnout is used, the real turnout will 
	    receive the original activation command, and then the
	    Route will set whatever turnout positions and/or sensor
	    states were specified. This can be used to set multiple 
	    turnouts to match the original real turnout, or to set 
	    the turnout back to its original position (if you don't 
	    want anybody changing it), etc. The Route will fire when 
	    the turnout is set from JMRI, and/or with some DCC 
	    systems (Digitrax LocoNet and Lenz XPressNet systems), it 
 		will fire when a layout operator commands the turnout to 
 		change state on a handheld throttle.
	    <LI>A 'Phantom Turnout' is a DCC turnout that doesn't 
	    actually exist. To use one, just create a turnout entry 
	    for an address number that doesn't exist on your layout.
	    The layout operators can select that phantom turnout number
 		on their throttles and send commands to it to cause the Route 
 		to be set.  With the addition of sensors as vetos in the 
		Route, you can do things like only allowing operators to 
		change turnouts (via the Route) when the dispatcher has set a
 		button to allow local access.
	    <LI>An 'Internal Turnout' is one that only exists within the
	    JMRI software; it doesn't correspond to any particular address 
	    on the layout, and it particularly doesn't correspond to any 
	    hardware on the layout.  The system name for internal turnouts 
	    start with "IT", e.g. "IT201".  JMRI knows that these are 
	    separate from the layout, so doesn't send any commands to the 
	    attached hardware when one changes. These can be used with 
	    Routes to build complicated logic underlying control panels.  
	    For example, an icon on a panel can set an internal turnout, 
	    which in turn can set the turnouts of an entire yard ladder.
 		</UL>
<p> Similar to the control sensors discussed above, the control turnout 
has a "mode" associated with it, which can be:
<DL>
<DT>"On Closed"</DT><DD>The default method, the Route is triggered when 
the turnout changes to the closed state.</DD>
<DT>"On Thrown"</DT><DD>The Route is triggered when the turnout
changes to the thrown state.</DD>
<DT>"On Change"</DT><DD>The Route is triggered when the turnout state
changes, either from closed to thrown or from thrown to closed.</DD>
<DT>"Veto Closed"</DT><DD>If this turnout is closed, sensors set 
to "On Active", "On Inactive" "On Change" will be ignored.</DD>
<DT>"Veto Thrown"</DT><DD>If this turnout is thrown, sensors set 
to "On Active", "On Inactive" "On Change" will be ignored.</DD>
</DL>
<p>A single 'veto' turnout or 'veto' sensor can prevent the Route from being 
triggered. All of the 'veto' sensors and the 'veto' turnout, if there 
is one, must be in their non-veto state _and_ at least one of the 
triggering sensors or a triggering turnout must see the appropriate 
change for the Route to be set.</p>
