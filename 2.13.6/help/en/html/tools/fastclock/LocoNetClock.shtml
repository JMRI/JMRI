<H2>JMRI's LocoNet Fast Clock Capability
</H2>

A Digitrax LocoNet can contain it's own fast clock timebase.
This can be driven either by a DCS100/DCS200 command station, or by
a separate fast clock module such as those made by Logic Rail Technologies.
This page discusses how JMRI can either use or control the LocoNet
fast clock.

<h3>Controlling the LocoNet clock</h3>
The "Clock Monitor" tool in the "LocoNet" menu provides a 
convenient way to:
<UL>
<LI>Read the current contents of the LocoNet fast clock
<LI>Set the date and time
<LI>Set the rate. Note that you can't explicitly pause a LocoNet clock, but you can stop
it by setting the rate to zero.
</UL>

If you are using a DCS100 or DCS200 command station to create your
LocoNet fast clock, you may have noticed that it doesn't keep particularly
good time.  If you select the "Correct LocoNet Fast Clock Master", 
JMRI will adjust the rate of the LocoNet clock so that it keeps better time.

<h3>Using the LocoNet clock</h3>

You can also have JMRI use the LocoNet clock for it's own, internal timebase.
This keeps the clocks that JMRI displays on the screen synchronized with the
LocoNet clock, hence the displays on DT400 throttles, etc.

<P>
To do this, select the "LocoNet Fast Clock sets Internal Clock" option on the 
LocoNet clock monitor window.
Note that you should do this <em>before</em>
opening the clock windows so that when you open the clock windows they
connect to the correct timebase.

Happy timekeeping!
