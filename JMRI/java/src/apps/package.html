        Provides application level support for JMRI; includes specific applications in 
        subpackages.

        <P>
            Logging support is handled through the Log4J package.  By contention,
            it is configured via the default.lcf file.  That has extensive
            comments on how to configure the logging, including how
            to write to a log file, control output verbosity, etc.
