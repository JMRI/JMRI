/**
 * BasicRosterEntry represents a single element in a locomotive roster, including
 * information on how to locate it from decoder information.
 * <p>
 * The roster interface is too allow access to the Basic details of a Roster
 * entry in the jmri.jmrit.roster package from the jmri.jmrix package.
 * <p>
 * Primarily this only deals as a method to provide other packages with access
 * to the information rather than being able set or create items. However access
 * to set and get Attributes is allowed so that attributes like running duration
 * can be recorded, with the store option also avaiable.
 * <p>
 * This interface should probably be called RosterEntry, but this would result in another class 
 * with the same name; refactoring of that class would be a big job and would potentially cause issue
 * with users scripts etc.
 * <p>
 * For Full read/write and creation of RosterEntries use the @link
 * jmri.jmrit.roster.RosterEntry
 * <p>
 * All properties, including the "Attributes", are bound.
