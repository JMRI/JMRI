        Defines classes for communicating with the CAN network
        via hardware which uses the 
        <a href="http://www.gridconnect.com/canboandto.html">GridConnect format</a>.
        <p>
            The primary implementation handles the regular format.
            The canusb package is a vestigal specific implementation which has
            been pulled back into the main package for the
            "CAN via GridConnect adapter" connection.

        <p>
            The 
            MERG CAN-RS and CAN-USB adapters speak a slightly different
            varient of the GridConnect protocol, where the 
            computer-to-adapter headers are fixed length and left-justified.
            This is handled via inheritance in the gridconnect.canrs 
            subpackage.
