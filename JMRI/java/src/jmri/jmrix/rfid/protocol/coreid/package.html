        This package holds objects specific to the RFID stand-alone readers that
        use the <a href="http://id-innovations.com/httpdocs/EM%20moudule%20SERIES%20V27%20(2008-4-05).pdf">CORE-ID / ID-Innovations protocol.</a>
        <p>
            Amongst others, this includes the MERG stand-alone and SparkFun modules.
        <p>
            As this protocol is uni-directional, the specific Reporters and Sensors incorporate
            a time-out technique as opposed to being explicitly de-activated.
