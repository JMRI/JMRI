TODO List for Lenz code (as of 2/9/2009, i18n completed 7/2017):
1) Need to seperate constants for Xpressnet V1 from those for X-Bus V1 
and V2.
2) Complete browser for the Command Station Locomotive database 
(similar to the Digitrax "Slot Manager")
3) Add a message indicating another device has put the command station
in service mode.  This should be displayed in the status message on the main JMRI window.
