/**
 * XNetInterface defines the general connection to an XNet layout.
 * <P>
 * Use this interface to send messages to an XNet layout. Classes implementing
 * the XNetListener interface can register here to receive incoming XNet
 * messages as events.
 * <P>
 * The jmri.jrmix.lenz.XNetTrafficControler provides the first implementation of
 * this interface.
 * <P>
 * How do you locate an implemenation of this interface? That's an interesting
 * question. This is inherently XNet specific, so it would be inappropriate to
 * put it in the jmri.InterfaceManager. And Java interfaces can't have static
 * members, so we can't provide an implementation() member. For now, we use a
 * static implementation member in the XNetTrafficController implementation to
 * locate _any_ implementation; this clearly needs to be improved.
 * <P>
 * XNetListener implementations registering for traffic updates cannot assume
 * that messages will be returned in any particular thread. See the XNetListener
 * doc for more background.
