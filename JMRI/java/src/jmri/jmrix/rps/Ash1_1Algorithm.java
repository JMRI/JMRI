/**
 * Implementation of version 1.1 algorithm for reducing Readings
 * <P>
 * This algorithm was provided by Robert Ashenfelter based in part on the work
 * of Ralph Bucher in his paper "Exact Solution for Three Dimensional Hyperbolic
 * Positioning Algorithm and Synthesizable VHDL Model for Hardware
 * Implementation".
 * <P>
 * Neither Ashenfelter nor Bucher provide any guarantee as to the intellectual
 * property status of this algorithm. Use it at your own risk.
 *
 *
 * The following is a summary of this version from Robert Ashenfelter:
 * <P>
 * When the receivers are in a plane or nearly so there is a spurious solution
 * on the other side of the plane from the correct solution and in certain
 * situations the version 1.0 program may choose the wrong solution.
 * <P>
 * It turns out that those situations are when the receiver configuration is not
 * sufficiently non-planar for the size of the measurement errors. The greater
 * the errors, the greater the non-planarity must be to avoid he bug.
 * <P>
 * I had hoped to be able to devise some measure of the non-planarity of the
 * receiver configuration and to set some threshold below which the program
 * would switch to a different algorithm but this didn't seem to be working out
 * very well. After trying several things, I have chosen to use an iterative
 * procedure to determine an approximate solution.
 * <P>
 * Here is a description of the new program.
 * <P>
 * As before the first thing it does is sort the receivers in order of
 * increasing time delay, discarding those that failed or are too far or too
 * near, and using the closest ones. There is a maximum that are used, still set
 * at 15.
 * <P>
 * Next it computes a preliminary transmitter position which is used to
 * discriminate against spurious solutions and to compute weights. This is the
 * part of the program that has been changed to fix the bug. The new algorithm
 * looks at one receiver at a time and moves the estimated position directly
 * toward or away from it such that the distance is equal to the measured value.
 * After going through the receivers once in order, it then chooses them at
 * random until it has iterated some fixed number of times. This is set at 1000
 * although the procedure usually converges in 20-50 iterations; for occasional
 * positions the convergence is much slower. The random order is used because
 * the procedure was occasionally observed to get stuck in a loop when using a
 * repetitive fixed order. Rather than start with the origin as the initial
 * position, it now starts from a position far, far below. This removes the
 * restriction that the origin must be below the receivers.
 * <P>
 * Finally, as before, the transmitter position is computed as a weighted
 * average of the GPS solutions for all possible sets of three receivers. (For
 * 15 receivers, that's 455 solutions.) The weights are the same as before.
 * Unless one of them chooses a spurious solution, both versions of the program
 * produce the same computed position.
 * <P>
 * Restrictions:
 * <OL>
 * <LI>The origin can be anywhere, but the z-axis must be vertical with positive
 * z upward.
 *
 * <LI>In general, the transmitter should be below some or all of the receivers.
 * How much below depends on the receiver configuration.
 *
 * <LI>If the receivers are in a plane, or nearly so, the transmitter must
 * absolutely be below the plane. As it approaches the plane (such that the
 * lines-of-sight to the receivers make shallow angles with respect to the
 * plane), the accuracy degrades and ultimately the program may report failure.
 * If above the plane, the program reports incorrect positions.
 *
 * <LI>If the receivers are not in a plane, it may be possible to move the
 * transmitter up among them. In general it should remain inside or below the
 * volume of space contained by the receivers. However if the configuration is
 * sufficiently non-planar the transmitter can go farther. But the limits are
 * uncertain and there is no warning as it approaches a limit; the reported
 * position suddenly jumps to somewhere else, or perhaps it jumps back and forth
 * depending on measurement errors. An extreme example is 8 receivers at the
 * corners of a cube, which is about as non-planar as it gets. In this case the
 * transmitter can go outside the cube by several times the width of the cube,
 * both laterally and vertically, before the program gets into trouble.
 * </OL>
 * <P>
 * I have tested the program with nearly 20 different receiver configurations
 * having from 3 to 100 receivers. Most were tested at 60 or more transmitter
 * locations and with infinitesimal, nominal (+/-0.25 inches--Walter's spec.),
 * and large (+/-2.5 inches) measurement errors. Half of the configurations
 * consisted of a 10 x 20-foot room with the ceiling 5 feet above the lowest
 * transmitter positions and the receivers (from 3 to 18) located on the walls
 * and/or ceiling. Other configurations are Larry Wade's rather-small oval test
 * track with 4 receivers and a 14-foot square and an 8-foot cube (mentioned
 * above). Large, 100-receiver configurations include a 25 x 10 x 5-foot space
 * with receivers randomly located throughout (rather unrealistic) and a 100 x
 * 10 x 5-foot space with receivers arranged in 4 rows of 25, one row on each
 * long wall and two rows on the ceiling. Performance (i.e. accuracy of the
 * measured transmitter position) is excellent throughout this latter space.
 * <P>
 * Two other configurations are 20-foot-diameter geodesic domes with receivers
 * located at the vertices of the triangular faces of the domes, one with 16
 * receivers and one with 46. Performance is good throughout the interior of
 * these domes, but surprisingly it is no better with 46 receivers than with 16,
 * near the perimeter a bit worse. Presumably this is because of the limited
 * number of closest receivers used by the position program. In order to do
 * justice to this, or any other configuration with closely-spaced receivers,
 * the program needs to use data from more than the 15 receivers currently used.
 * <P>
 * As a result of all this testing, I feel pretty confident that version 1.1
 * works reliably if used within the restrictions listed above. But the
 * disclaimer about "usability and correctness" stays.
 * <P>
 * The execution time is increased a little by all those iterations. It now
 * ranges from 0.5 millisecond with 3 receivers to 1.9 millisecond with 15 or
 * more receivers (1.0 GHz Pentium III).
