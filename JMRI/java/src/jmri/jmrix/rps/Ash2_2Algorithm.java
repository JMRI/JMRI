 * Implementation of 2.1th algorithm for reducing Readings

 * Positioning Algorithm and Synthesizable VHDL Model for Hardware
 * Implementation".

 * <h2>RPSpos2.2 program description.</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * As in previous versions, the first thing it does is sort the receivers in
 * order of increasing time delay, discarding those that failed or are too far
 * or too near, and using the closest ones. There is a maximum that are used,
 * still set at 50.
 * <p>
 * Next it discards those receivers with gross measurement errors. All possible
 * pairs of receivers are checked to see if the sum of their measured ranges is
 * less than, or the difference is greater than, the distance between the
 * receivers. Counts are maintained for each receiver and the one with the
 * largest count is booted out. The procedure is repeated until there are no
 * more failures. If fewer than three receivers are left there can be no
 * solution and an error code is returned.
 * <p>
 * Two iterative techniques are used which I call "One-At-A-Time" and
 * "All-Together." The first looks at one receiver at a time and moves the
 * estimated position directly toward or away from it such that the distance is
 * equal to the measured value. This simple technique usually converges quite
 * rapidly. The second technique accumulates the adjustments for all receivers
 * and then computes and applies an average for all. It also computes the
 * variance of the residual errors (differences between measured receiver
 * distances and those from the computed position) which is used to monitor the
 * progress of the iterative solution and it implements the rejection of the
 * measurement with the largest residual when it is deemed to be an outlier. The
 * second technique is not as fast as the first, but is ultimately more
 * accurate.
 * <p>
 * The solution proceeds in seven stages, much like those in versions 2.0 and
 * 2.1. Stage 0 does 50 One-At-A-Time iterations with the receivers in the
 * sorted order. As in previous versions, it starts from a position far, far
 * below any likely final point. Stage 1 continues the One-At-A-Time iterations
 * with the receivers in reverse order. Every 50 such iterations the
 * All-Together procedure is run to check the variance but not to reject
 * outliers. The One-At-A-Time procedure usually converges in 20-50 iterations,
 * however for occasional positions the convergence is much slower. The program
 * moves on to the next stage after a total of 750 iterations, or sooner if it
 * appears that no further improvement can be had. If the variance indicates
 * that convergence has been achieved and there are no significant errors, then
 * the program skips directly to Stage 6.
 * <p>
 * Stage 2 is where the outliers are rejected. This is only run when there are
 * more than 6 receivers; if there are 5 or 6, Stage 3 is run instead; if 4
 * receivers, Stage 4 (sometimes). By this time a correct, but not particularly
 * accurate, position should have been obtained. The One-At-A-Time technique is
 * continued for an additional 200 iterations with the receivers in reverse
 * order ending with the closest receiver. Weights are applied assuming that
 * close measurements are more accurate than distant ones. The weights fade out
 * during the iterations so that at the end the adjustments are very small. This
 * fade-out fixes a problem with the One-At-A-Time technique in that it gives
 * undue weight to the last receiver. The result at this point should be quite
 * accurate, at least for the measurements that are still in play. At this point
 * the All-Together procedure is run to compute the variance and eliminate an
 * outlier. Unlike version 2.1, the receiver with the largest residual error is
 * always discarded--if it is actually OK, it will be put back in Stage 5. The
 * entire stage-2 procedure is repeated until the number of receivers has been
 * reduced to 6 or until the iteration count reaches 2000, then moves on to
 * Stage 3.
 * <p>
 * Stages 3 and 5 are new to version 2.2. Stage 3 runs only with 6 and 5
 * receivers. It solves for all subsets with one receiver removed by running the
 * One-At-A-Time iteration 250 times, with weights and fade-out, and then using
 * All-Together to check the variances of the residuals. The receiver which was
 * removed resulting in the subset with the smallest variance is then discarded
 * as possibly being errored. Unlike the outlier rejection of Stage 2, which
 * often discards the wrong receiver, this procedure usually gets it right. But
 * it is too computationally intensive to use with a large number of receivers.
 * <p>
 * Stage 4 runs only with 4 receivers and rejects an "outlier" using the same
 * procedure as Stage 2. However, it is only run if the variance is considerably
 * more than just marginally large, i.e. not if there are only small random
 * measurement errors. With one error in 4 receivers it is theoretically
 * impossible to determine which one. But, what the heck, there's no harm in
 * trying. And if it should happen to succeed in ousting the errored receiver
 * and there are also previously-rejected good receivers that Stage 5 can put
 * back, then the measurement is salvaged and the correct position is reported
 * with no error code.
 * <p>
 * At this point we may be down to four receivers only (or perhaps three), but
 * they should be all good receivers. Stage 5 runs the One-At-A-Time iteration
 * 300 times, with weights and fade-out, and then the All-Together procedure to
 * get a good solution with only the remaining receivers. Then all of the
 * rejected receivers are checked to see if any of them agree with this solution
 * and if so they are put back into the list of good receivers. The reason for
 * doing this is that the outlier rejection often rejects the wrong receiver.
 * Since this means we need to do this put-back anyway, Stages 2 to 4 are
 * arranged to keep on rejecting receivers regardless of whether it does any
 * good. But Stages 2 to 4 do check the variance and skip to this stage if it
 * indicates that there are no more significant errors.
 * <p>
 * Stage 6 is similar to Stage 3 of version 2.1 except that it runs the
 * One-At-A-Time iteration in addition to the All-Together iteration, both using
 * weights according to distance, with the intent to produce a more refined
 * result. First it runs the One-At-A-Time iteration 250 more times, with
 * weights and fade-out, to make sure the solution is close since the
 * All-Together iterations sometimes converge rather slowly. Unlike version 2.1,
 * it does not attempt to discard outliers. The iterations continue until the
 * All-Together procedure can do no more or until the total iteration count
 * reaches 5000. (Note that a single instance of All-Together increments the
 * iteration count by the number of receivers currently in use.)
 * <p>
 * Like version 2.1, this version does not always, or even usually, run through
 * all the iterations, but instead cuts them short and also cuts out stages when
 * the solution has converged. The total number of iterations is between 342
 * (with only 3 receivers) and 5000. The estimated execution time ranges from
 * 0.13 to ~2.0 milliseconds (1.0 GHz Pentium III).
 * <p>
 * Input/output is the same as for previous versions and is described in the
 * e-mail with version 1.0 sent on 11/17/06.
 * <p>
 * Return values are the same as with version 2.1. These are as follows.
 * <pre>
 * {@literal >= 4}    OK.  Value = number of receivers used.
 *  3    Probably OK.  3 receivers used.
 *  1,2    Questionable.  Maybe OK, maybe not.
 *  0    No solution.  Don't even think about using it.  (Position outside the known universe.)
 *  -1,-2    Not used.
 * {@literal <=} -3    Variance of residuals too big.  Probably no good.  Value = minus number of receivers used.
 * (Perhaps close if input is noisy or receiver locations are sloppy.)
 * </pre> Variance too big means RMS residuals {@literal >} 30 microseconds,
 * i.e. about 0.4 inch or 1.0 cm. This is about as small a threshold as I dare
 * use lest random errors occasionally make good measurements appear bad.
 * <p>
 * The restrictions on the configuration of transmitters and receivers,
 * necessary to prevent the program from reporting a spurious position, are the
 * same as those for version 1.1. These are described in the e-mail with that
 * version sent on 12/9/06.
