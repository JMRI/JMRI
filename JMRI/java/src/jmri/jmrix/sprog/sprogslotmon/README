The jmrix.sprog.sprogslotmon package contains a graphical slot monitor for SPROG
soft command stations. It is based on the original loconet slot monitor

The JMRI web page is located at http://jmri.org/

The SprogSlotMonDataModel object is the Swing datamodel part of a JTable, used 
as a data member in the SprogSlotMonFrame.  The SprogSlotMonDataModel interacts with
the Sprog-specific SlotManager; at some point, we may want to have a more
general SlotManager.
