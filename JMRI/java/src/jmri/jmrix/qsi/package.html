        Connects to a QSI programmer unit.

        <p>
            Messages to and from the programmer are
            in a packet format. In both directions,
            every message starts with 'S' and ends with 'E'.
            These are handled automatically, and are not 
            included in the QsiMessage and QsiReply content.
