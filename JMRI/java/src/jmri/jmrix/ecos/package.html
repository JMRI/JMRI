        Support for the ESU ECoS.

        <p>
            The current implementation just does turnout 
            (accessory decoder) operations only.

        <h2>Related Documentation</h2>

        Additional information on the ECoS can be found
        on the 
        <a href="http://www.loksound.de/us/index.php?showId=205">ESU web site</a>.

        <p>
            The ECoS contains a "database" of information, which must be
            asynchronously maintained with respect to the JMRI internal
            state.
            The
            <a href="model/package.html">model</a>
            subpackage maintains a local copy of the
            ECoS local state, which is then manipulated
            by JMRI objects.
