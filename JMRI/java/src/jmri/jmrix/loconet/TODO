Is the SlotManager an instance of something more general?


SlotManager's handling of the programmer is problematic:

 a) Have to sort out the threading model, which is certainly inconsistent
    now.  The jmri.programmer spec has all those interactions in the Swing
    thread.
    
 b) Not happy with the state model. Since the LACK does _not_ carry enough
    information to ensure its to the programmer slot, need to have
    recognize that the previous slot write was the programmer op
    (in case others are queued)
    
 c) Document (and thereby think through) the way exceptions are 
    returning indications of problems.  What and when, etc.
    
 d) And clean up the mess!  Too many constants, etc.
