The jmrix.slotmon package contains a graphical slot monitor for Digitrax
command stations.

The SlotMonDataModel object is the Swing datamodel part of a JTable, used 
as a data member in the SlotMonFrame.  The SlotMonDataModel interacts with
the LocoNet-specific SlotManager; at some point, we may want to have a more
general SlotManager.
