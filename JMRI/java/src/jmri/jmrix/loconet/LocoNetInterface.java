/**
 * LocoNetInterface defines the general connection to a LocoNet layout.
 * <P>
 * Use this interface to send messages to a LocoNet layout. Classes implementing
 * the LocoNetListener interface can register here to receive incoming LocoNet
 * messages as events.
 * <P>
 * The jmri.jrmix.loconet.LnTrafficManager provides the first implementation of
 * this interface.
 * <P>
 * How do you locate an implemenation of this interface? That's an interesting
 * question. This is inherently LocoNet specific, so it would be inappropriate
 * to put it in the jmri.InterfaceManager. And Java interfaces can't have static
 * members, so we can't provide an implementation() member. For now, we use a
 * static implementation member in the LnTrafficManager implementation to locate
 * _any_ implementation; this clearly needs to be improved.
 * <P>
 * LocoNetListener implementations registering for traffic updates cannot assume
 * that messages will be returned in any particular thread. See the
 * LocoNetListener doc for more background.
