This package provides an interface to an XPressNet based system using an 
XPressNet Phone Adapter and a Modem.

Notes:

This interface is slow when compared to interfaces like the LI100 and 
LI101F.

There is only support for throwing turnouts, operating locomotives, and 
turning the power on and off.

There is no effective means of feedback available from the command 
station.

Known Issues:

Currently, the modem must support Hayes style modem commands.  
ATX0E0 is used as the modem initialization string.

It is possible to interrupt a command while it is being sent to the XPA, 
resulting in incomplete instructions, and, possibly unwanted power 
shutdown commands being sent.
