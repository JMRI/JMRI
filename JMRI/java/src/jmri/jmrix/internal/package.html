        The jmrix.internal package contains a jmri implementation
        for use without a layout.  There's nothing connected to these
        classes, which is why we call them "internal".  But they might
        be good for debugging....

        <p>

            Note that this package is <b>not</b> used to create
            the "Internal" sensor, turnout, etc managers with an "I"
            system letter.  
            Those are created automatically by the Proxy managers in the
            jmri.managers package.
