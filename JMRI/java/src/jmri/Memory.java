/**
 * Represent a Memory, a place to store values.
 * <P>
 * The AbstractMemory class contains a basic implementation of the state and
 * messaging code, and forms a useful start for a system-specific
 * implementation. Specific implementations in the jmrix package, e.g. for
 * LocoNet and NCE, will convert to and from the layout commands.
 * <P>
 * The states and names are Java Bean parameters, so that listeners can be
 * registered to be notified of any changes.
 * <P>
 * Each Memory object has a two names. The "user" name is entirely free form,
 * and can be used for any purpose. The "system" name is provided by the
 * system-specific implementations, and provides a unique mapping to the layout
 * control system (for example LocoNet or NCE) and address within that system.
