/**
 * Manage tasks to be completed when the program shuts down normally.
 * Specifically, allows other object to register and deregister
 * {@link ShutDownTask} objects, which are invoked in an orderly way when the
 * program is is commanded to terminate.
 * <p>
 * Operations:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Execute each {@link ShutDownTask} in order reverse order of creation,
 * allowing it to abort the shutdown if needed.
 * <li>If not aborted, terminate the program.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * There can only be one instance of this operating, and it is generally
 * obtained via the instance manager.
 * <p>
 * Items are executed in reverse order to attempt to unwind the creation
 * process. Tasks should not count on this, however, as shutdown can be aborted
 * before a particular task is reached.
 * <p>
 * Tasks should leave the system in a state that can continue, in case a later
 * task aborts the shutdown.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this is normally obtained from the instance manager, but using
 * routines should not assume that one is always present; they should check for
 * a null manager and skip operations if needed.
