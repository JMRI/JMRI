/**
 * ClockControl defines an interface for control of hardware Fast Clocks
 * <P>
 * Each hardware system that has a hardware Fast Clock implementation must
 * supply a module that implements this interface. Each ClockControl module must
 * register itself with the Instance Manager at start up.
 * <P>
 * Parameters for fast clocks are set up generically in the Fast Clock Setup,
 * accessed via the JMRI Tools menu. These parameters are saved in the
 * configuration file generically, so no special configxml module is needed for
 * storing parameters.
 * <P>
 * Hardware ClockControl modules should extend DefaultClockControl, which
 * supplies default implementations of methods required by this interface that
 * specific hardware implementations may not need.
 * <P>
 * All Clock Control modules communicate with the internal clock and the master
 * JMRI timebase, using methods of the Timebase interface.
