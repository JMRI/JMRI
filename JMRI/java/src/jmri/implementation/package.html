        Provides implementations of various JMRI interfaces.

        <p>
            As a long term project, we're moving various Abstract* and Default*
            implementations out of the {@link jmri} package itself, and moved 
            into here. In the meantime, you'll find many of them still in 
            {@link jmri}.

        <p>
            Implementations of managers can be found in the
            {@link jmri.managers} package.

        <p>
            Implementations that use Swing should be put in the
            {@link jmri.implementation.swing} package.

            <!-- Put @see and @since tags down here. -->
            @see jmri.managers
            @since 2.1.5
