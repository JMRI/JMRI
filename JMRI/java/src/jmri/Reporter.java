/**
 * Represent a device that can report identification information.
 * <P>
 * Reporting devices might include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A DCC device that reports a locomotive number when it's in a particular
 * location
 * <LI>A device that reports something about the layout environment, e.g. the
 * current drawn or light intensity
 * <LI>A device that reacts to some happening on the layout with a complicated
 * report
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * In contrast to Sensors, a Reporter provides more detailed information. A
 * Sensor provides a status of ACTIVE or INACTIVE, while a Reporter returns an
 * Object. The real type of that object can be whatever a particular Reporter
 * finds useful to report. Typical values might be a String or Int, both of
 * which can be displayed, printed, equated, etc.
 * <P>
 * A Reporter might also not be able to report all the time. The previous value
 * remains available, but it's also possible to distinquish this case by using
 * the getCurrentReport member function.
