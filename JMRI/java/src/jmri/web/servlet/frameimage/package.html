        A servlet to provide access to any open JMRI window.
        <p>
            You can get the window as a PNG image, or as a HTML web page
            with various attributes.
            You can also get a list of available windows by not passing 
            one in.
        <p>
            Configuration of the HTML is via the JmriJFrameServlet.properties 
            file, allowing internationalization.
