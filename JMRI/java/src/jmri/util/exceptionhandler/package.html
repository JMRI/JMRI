        Provides general exception handlers that work with Log4J.

        <p>
            The default AWT and ThreadGroup exception handlers print a message
            and stack trace to System.err, and then return.  The classes
            in this package replace those, and send the exception information
            to a Log4J logger.

        <p>
            See information on use in the individual classes.

        <p>
            Java 1.7 removed the separate AWT exception handler
            set with the sun.awt.exception.handler system property.
            The AwtHandler was therefore removed from this package 
            for JMRI 4.3.4
            
            @since 2.9.4
