/**
 * Get access to available {@link Programmer} objects.

 * Programmers come in two types:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Global, previously "Service Mode" or on a programming track. Request
 * these from an instance of {@link GlobalProgrammerManager}.
 * <LI>Addressed, previously "Ops Mode" also known as "programming on the main".
 * Request these from an instance of this interface.
 * </UL>
 * You get a {@link Programmer} object from a ProgrammerManager, which in turn
 * can be located from the {@link InstanceManager}.
 * <P>
 * This interface also provides a reserve/release system for tools that want to
 * pretend they have exclusive use of a Programmer. This is a cooperative
 * reservation; both tools (first and second reserver) must be using the
