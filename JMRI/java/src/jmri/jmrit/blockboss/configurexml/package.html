        XML persistance for the jmrit.blockboss package.

        <p>
            In JMRI 2.1.5, the XML written by this 
            package was changed. 
        <p>
            Previously, it wrote a single
            "blocks" element, which contained multiple "block" elements 
            to represent each individual BlockBoss (Simple Signal Logic) object.
        <p>
            These names were too generic, and conflicted with storing true Block
            objects.
        <p>
            Starting in JMRI 2.1.5 (May 2008), these were changed to 
            "signalelements" and "signalelement" respectively.
