Todo as of 23/08/2017

   Should we ask if the consist should be cleared when the consist is 
     deleted or the window is closed? Yes, added in 4.9.4ish

   Need to ensure consists are added to address selection for throttle.

   Need to add code to handle front/rear/mid information currently stored 
   in the consist file.

   Table in tool has a slot for roster entry, this needs to be filled in 
   or removed.

   Per request from widebayburnett, add an "uncouple" button, that 
   deletes locomotive consist information so consist can be reordered, but 
   does not delete locomotive from consist list.

   Per request from Paul Fraker, Need to set throttle speed setting to 
   zero before adding or deleting a locomotive from a consist.

   Need to verify locomotive direction is correct when setting up a 
   command station consist.
