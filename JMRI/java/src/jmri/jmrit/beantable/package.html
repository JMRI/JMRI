        Provides table GUI for manipulating NamedBean objects: Turnouts, 
        Sensors, SignalHeads.
        <P>
            The table GUI is based on Swing JTables, using a common data
            model in the {@link jmri.jmrit.beantable.BeanTableDataModel} class.  This is
            then subclassed to provide services specific to each type
            of NamedBean.
