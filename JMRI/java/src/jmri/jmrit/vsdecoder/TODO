ConfigurableSound:  Timer creation function could/should be made same as EngineSound version and moved up to VSDSound and shared.
Engine transitions are still goofy.  Especially if you're moving the throttle around quickly...
VSDecoderPrefs... the path and profile name boxes need to be fixed.  Maybe with a browser added on the path.

VSDecoderPane:  Switching between Profiles crashes on a null pointer error in VSDecoder.setXmL (MomentarySoundEvent). I'm guessing it doesn't like the shared horn sound in the demo program.

HornSound:  It doesn't *sound* like the new K5LA horn is playing the start portion of the horn sound.  No debug in place to tell for sure.
