This directory builds a small override jar file
that modifies jmrit.roster class(es) for use in 
the "USB stick portable" version of JMRI.

To build, the 'scripts' CVS module needs to be
checked-out beside the main 'all' CVS module,
and the main JMRI sources compiled.

The resulting directory will have the following
structure:

help       <- from 'all'
java       <- from 'all'
jython     <- from 'all'
lib        <- from 'all'
resources  <- from 'all'
scripts    <- from 'scripts'
web        <- from 'all'
xml        <- from 'all'
