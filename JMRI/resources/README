The resources module contains various non-source-code files used
by JMRI classes.

See the COPYING file for the license.

Icon-like images are organized by size, e.g. in directories
with names like:

   images19x16
   images128x128
   
This is done to group interchangable images together:  There are usually
artifacts when an image is replaced by one of a different size, so its
better to use ones of a single size for the various states of a control, etc.

Names of individual files are meant to be robust (no spaces, case should
not be a distinguishing characteristic) and descriptive:

  redX.gif
  greencheck.gif
  
At some point, files might be made available to users alphabetically.  It
is therefore better to organized the names so that related files are
close together.  E.g.

  CtcTurnoutPlateLeft.gif and CtcTurnoutPlateRight.gif

rather than

  RightTurnoutCtcPlate.gif and LeftTurnoutPlateCtc.gif
  
Put colors, directions, etc, at the right end of the names.
