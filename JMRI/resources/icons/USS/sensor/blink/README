   US&S Artwork based on images from Mike Burgett of Control Train Components.
   These files were contributed by Dick Bronson.
   
   xxx-blink-web.gif  icons for web use provided by Robin Becker. 
   These icons have minimum frame delays of 60 ms for compatibility with all 
   web browsers (and may also be used for JMRI internal panels). 
   They also use the same full-on frame as xxx-on.gif and same full-off frame 
   as xxx-off.gif, so they appear consistent when going between steady and 
   blinking.
