The Panel-*-9 files are slices used to put together a panel 
background that's 900 pixels high.

The Panel-* files are similar slices for panels that are 718 pixels 
high, e.g. for a 800 pixel high monitor.

The uss-15.gif and uss-15-dual.gif files are backgrounds for 
a 15-section panel that are 1000 pixels wide by 718 high, e.g. 
nicely fit a 1000x800 monitor.
