Icons for Rio Grande 1965 Signal Aspects (RG-1965)
Base don the AAR-1946 icons.

Place icons in the Applications/JMRI/resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/RG-1965 Folder.

Some special file versions are included:
rule-282.gis is an animated icon, works fine in JMRI 3.2 but doesn�t show as an aspect on the panel with JMRI 2.14.1 on Mac OSX 10.5.8 (Java 1.5).
rule-282-1.gif and rule-282-2.gif are the 2 files used to create the animated gif rule-282.gif

For JMRI 2.14.1 a static icon rule-282-b.gif is included, which can be renamed to rule-282.gif and can be copied to the preference folder under resource/icons/smallschematics/aspects/RG-1965 and will overrule the icons in the application�s resource folder.
