    <h1>JMRI Help</h1>

    <p>This is the top-level Help page for JMRI.</p>

    <p>The <a href="Acknowledgements.shtml">acknowledgements
    page</a> shows that a lot of people have been able to
    contribute.</p>

    <h2>Using The Help System</h2>

    <p>If you're viewing this via the program's Help tool, the
    section to the left gives you three types of access to JMRI's
    help.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The "book" icon shows a <a href="webtoc.shtml">Table of
      Contents</a> view</li>

      <li>The "tabbed" icon shows the <a href=
      "webindex.shtml">Index</a></li>

      <li>The "magnifying glass" icon lets you search the
      contents</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you're viewing this on the web, the links above will get
    you to the corresponding sections.</p>

    <h2>Further information</h2>

    <p>The main JMRI web page <a href=
    "http://jmri.org">http://jmri.org</a> is a good place to start
    for information about current status, updates, etc.<br>
    (Depending on your computer, you might have to copy that link
    to your web browser to be able to see external sites
    properly).</p>

    <p>The <a href=
    "http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-announce">jmri-announce</a>
    mailing list carries announcements of new versions, major
    changes, etc. This list is intended to be very low traffic;
    discussions, etc. should take place elsewhere. You can
    subscribe by sending the word "subscribe" in the subject or
    body of an email to <a href=
    "mailto:jmri-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net">jmri-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

    <p>We have a "JMRI Users" Yahoo group for general discussion.
    If you want to ask a question, get some help, or suggest some
    improvement, that discussion group is a good place. You can
    subscribe, browse posts, etc. at <a href=
    "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/</a>.</p>

    <p>Our <a href=
    "http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical
    web pages</a> are continually being updated. We're always short
    of documentation, so if you're interested in working with the
    code or updating some Help files, we'd love to help you
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">
    get started</a>.</p>
