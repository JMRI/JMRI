      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <h3>CBUS Naming</h3>JMRI provides support for general JMRI
      <a href="../../../tools/Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a>, <a href=
      "../../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnouts</a> and <a href=
      "../../../tools/Lights.shtml">Lights</a> in terms of CBUS
      "events".

      <p>The <a href="../../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">system
      letter</a> for MERG CBUS connections is "M".</p>

      <p>Details of CBUS Event and object names are described
      below, with technical details on a <a href=
      "Names.shtml">separate page</a>.</p>

      <p>JMRI associates CBUS events with individual JMRI objects
      (Sensors, Turnouts, Lights, etc.) via the JMRI System Names.
      A System Name like "<code>MS+123;-345</code>" defines a
      Sensor that follows the "123 ON" and "345 OFF" CBUS events to
      change state. Depending on which CBUS event-IDs are used on a
      particular layout, these system names can get very long, in
       which case the "user names" become much more useful.</p>

      <h3>Adding an item to the table</h3>
      <p>When you add an item to one of the tables, many times you only
      have to fill in the numbers to have JMRI construct
      the complete system name.<br>
      Here's a summary, split up for outputs (eg. Turnouts) and
      inputs (eg. Sensors):</p>

      <h3>Sensors</h3>

      <p>CBUS messages coming into JMRI applications can be
      accessed via JMRI Sensor objects. The Sensor's <a href=
      "Names.shtml">System Name</a> determines which CBUS
      message(s) it corresponds to. A Sensor is defined by two
      events: The one that sets it ACTIVE, and the one that sets it
      INACTIVE. If these are mapped to ON and OFF frames with the
      same event ID number, respectively, only the event ID number
      need be specified:<br>
      <code>MS18</code><br>
      The number is decimal.</p>

      <p>To increase versatility, it's possible to use different
      event ID numbers for the ACTIVE transition (by default, an ON
      frame) and INACTIVE transition (by default, an OFF
      frame):<br>
      <code>MS18;21</code></p>

      <p>The ON and OFF coding of CBUS is not entirely consistent
      with the event model, and it may be useful to connect the
      ACTIVE or INACTIVE transition of a JMRI Sensor to an OFF or
      ON CBUS frame respectively. Leading "+" and "-" characters
      can do this. For example,<br>
      <code>MS-18;+21</code><br>
      defines a sensor that goes ACTIVE when an OFF frame with ID
      number 18 is received, and goes INACTIVE when an ON frame
      with ID number 21 is received.</p>

      <p>CBUS event numbers (usually) contain a node number in
      their most-significant bytes. You can specify the node number
      either by using a full 5 decimal digits for the event number
      itself, preceded by the node number:<br>
      <code>MS200018</code><br>
      or by using the letters "N" and "E" to specify the separate
      parts:<br>
      <code>MSN2E18</code><br></p>

      <p>You can mask off part of the CBUS packet, so any values in
      the masked part will still match, using the "M" format
      letter.<br>
      <code>MS200018M07</code><br>
      "M" indicates the start of a hexadecimal mask that will be
      applied, where 1 bits in the mask will be zero bits in the
      resulting value. In the example above, "18" through "1F" will
      match. This is particularly useful for matching e.g. CBUS
      short events, where parts of the packet include the node
      number which should (usually) be ignored.</p>

      <p>Finally, it's possible to connect a Sensor to arbitrary
      CAN frames by specifying their data content as a hex string,
      indicated by "X":<br>
      <code>MSX9100000000000012;X9100000000000019</code><br>
      This allows the Sensor to disregard any intrinsic meaning to
      "ON" and "OFF" events, and allows it to respond to any frame
      on the layout.</p>

      <h4>Automatic Creation</h4>

      <p>JMRI automatically attempts to create Sensor objects from
      the traffic that it hears on the CBUS. When JMRI hears an ON
      or OFF event on the CBUS, it creates a Sensor using the
      corresponding event ID. This automatically-created sensor
      defaults to the ON event setting the Sensor ACTIVE and the
      OFF event setting INACTIVE.</p>

      <p>Because events are not intrinsically associated with
      specific hardware objects, and because people can use event
      IDs in many ways, this doesn't do what's desired. When it
      doesn't, you can manually create the proper Sensors using the
      <a href=
      "../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorAddEdit.shtml">
      Add...</a> button on the <a href=
      "../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor
      Table</a>.</p>

      <p>Note that there's a <a href=
      "../../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/swing/configtool/ConfigToolFrame.shtml">
      CBUS Event Capture Tool</a> that can help you create Turnouts
      and Sensor names without having to directly work out the
      System Names.</p>

      <h3>Turnouts</h3>

      <p>(To be written; the scheme is similar to Sensors
      above, except JMRI is emitting the CBUS frames instead of
      receiving them, and the type letter is "T" instead of "S",
      e.g. <code>MT-18;+21</code>)</p>

      <h3>Lights</h3>

      <p>(To be written; the scheme is similar to Turnouts
      above, except the type letter is "L" instead of "T", e.g.
      <code>ML-18;+21</code>) <a name="tools" id="tools"></a></p>
