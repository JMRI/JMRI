      <h1>Hardware Setup Support: Terminal Server Connection</h1>

      <p>A <strong>Terminal Server</strong> is a box that connects
      one or more serial ports to a network so they can be accessed
      from a remote computer. JMRI running on a computer with a
      network connection can connect to an EasyDCC or NCE Command
      Station or C/MRI nodes via one of these. This allows you to
      put the computer and layout as far apart as you'd like.

      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <p>This capability was originally created for david zuhn, who
      has a <a href=
      "http://stpaulterminal.org/software/jmri/lantronix.html">web
      page</a> describing in detail how he set it up for
      EasyDCC.</p>

      <p>The NCE and C/MRI set up processes are
      similar.</p><a name="connecting" id="connecting"></a>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>To make this work, you have to configure
      both JMRI and the Terminal Server, and make the appropriate
      connections.

      <h3>Settings</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>To configure JMRI:

          <ul>
            <li>Select the "Connections" tab in the "Preferences"
            from the "Edit" menu</li>

            <li>Select "Easy DCC" as the System Manufacturer</li>

            <li>Select "EasyDCC over terminal server" as the System
            Connection</li>

            <li>Enter the IP address and TCP/UDP Port number
            corresponding to the serial port on the terminal
            server</li>

            <li>Click "Save" &amp; quit the program</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Configure the Terminal Server to connect to the command
        station: 9600 baud, no parity, 8 bits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Wiring</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Connect a serial cable from the Terminal Server to the
        Command Station. Depending on the type of the Terminal
        Server, this might require that you wire a custom cable to
        get the right connectors. Note that you want the "Transmit
        data" wire on one end to connect to the "Receive data" on
        the other. Do this for both directions, and also include a
        ground wire.</li>

        <li>Make the network connections needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Start JMRI. If everything is OK, the application will
      start and tell you on the splash screen it's properly
      connected.</p>
