      <h1>Hardware Support: OpenLCB - Technical
      Details</h1><em>JMRI support for OpenLCB is rapidly evolving;
      the actual code might be ahead or behind the documentation on
      any given day.</em>

      <p>This page describes technical details of JMRI's <a href=
      "index.shtml">OpenLCB</a> support.</p>

      <h2>CAN Adapters</h2>

      <p>JMRI's general approach is to support as many hardware
      combinations as possible. By supporting as many people and
      their hardware desires as possible, we can create a growing
      community of developers, hence more code.</p>

      <p>As part of this, JMRI CAN support is designed to use as
      many CAN adapter types as possible.</p>

      <h2>Node ID</h2>

      <p>JMRI on an OpenLCB network acts - in part - like an
      OpenLCB Node. As such, it needs a unique 6-byte OpenLCB Node
      ID. It builds this automatically every time it starts up by
      combining the JMRI OpenLCB unique prefix with one byte from
      the computer's IP address and two bytes of the process ID of
      the JMRI application. This allows you to e.g. run JMRI on
      multiple computers or multiple copies on one computer without
      problems.</p>

      <p>A future enhancement will make these persistent from run
      to run, so that they can be used to easily create unique and
      persistent eventIDs. <a name="documentation" id=
