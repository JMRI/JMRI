      <h1>Hardware Support: Connecting a LocoBuffer to
      LocoNet&reg;</h1>

      <p>John Jabour designed the LocoBuffer as a reliable way of
      connecting a computer to a LocoNet&reg;. He's no longer
      making them, but <a href=
      "http://users.pandora.be/deloof/page5.html">Hans deLoof</a>
      has taken over for people who want to build their own.</p>

      <p>The <a href="LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer II</a> is
      currently the most reliable commercially-available way to
      connect a computer to a LocoNet. It is produced by Dick
      Bronson's <a href="http://www.rr-cirkits.com">RR-CirKits</a>
      company, based in part on the original LocoBuffer design.</p>

      <h2>Recommended setup</h2>

      <p>The recommended setup for the LocoBuffer is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The LocoBuffer should be configured with J1, J4 and J5
        set on pins 1 and 2, J2 and J3 set to pins 2 and 3. This
        configures it for a 19,200 baud connection, with echo
        on.</li>

        <li>Start DecoderPro or other program and configure it for:

          <ul>
            <li>LocoNet LocoBuffer</li>

            <li>Select your port</li>

            <li>19,200 baud</li>

            <li>Hardware flow control</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Usage suggestions</h2>

      <p>For the most reliable operation, turn on your layout and
      computer before you turn on the LocoBuffer.</p>

      <p>Some computers can successfully communicate at 57,600bps
      with a LocoBuffer. To do this, select "57,600 baud" when
      configuring and configure your LocoBuffer with J4 and J5 set
      on pins 1 and 2, J1, J2 and J3 set to pins 2 and 3 (J1 is the
      one that determines the baud rate). But we strongly recommend
      that you try 19,200 and make sure that works first.</p>

      <p>The LocoBuffer controller chip should contain version
      1.4.6 or later of the LocoBuffer program. Note that
      LocoBuffer version 1.4.5 has a bug that prevents it from
      working with this program. If you got your LocoBuffer chip
      after February 2002, this should not be a problem for
      you.</p>

      <h2><a name="flow" id="flow">LocoBuffer flow control</a></h2>

      <p>Some Windows versions, in particular Win2000, cannot
      handle the LocoBuffer's control leads properly. You'll see
      this as DecoderPro or PanelPro being unable to communicate
      with the command station, even though you can see LocoNet
      traffic with the LocoNet monitor. To fix this, try opening
      the preferences and select "no flow control" option, click
      save, then quit and restart the program. Note that this
      problem is specific to certain Windows versions, and you
      generally should have "hardware flow control" selected.</p>

      <p>If the problem persists, please try jumpering-together the
      pins 5, 6 and 8 on the LocoBuffer's 25-pin connector. These
      are the CTS, DSR, and DCD leads in the LocoBuffers RS232
      interface, and connecting them will (perhaps) fool your
      computer into accepting the LocoBuffers flow control
      signals.</p>

      <p>That connector has a row of 12 pins and a row of 13.
      Looking at the solder-side of the board, pin 1 is at the end
      of the row of 13 (toward the center of the board), at the end
      nearest the RJ12 LocoNet jack. Next to that are pins 2, 3, 4
      and 5 with traces on them. Pin 6 is next to that, with
      nothing connected. Pin 7 (ground) has a trace, then pin 8
      does not.</p>

      <p>So the suggestion is to connect pin 5 (with a trace) to
      pin 6 and 8 (without traces). Be careful not to short to pin
      7, which is already connected.</p>
