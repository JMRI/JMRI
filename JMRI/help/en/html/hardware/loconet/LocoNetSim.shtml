        <h1>Hardware Support: LocoNet&reg; Simulator</h1>

        <p>If JMRI is configured to use a Digitrax LocoNet&reg;
        connection, but the connection isn't available, several
        aspects of the program will not function. This is because
        the program needs to interact with the LocoNet during
        normal operation, and without the expected responses from
        the LocoNet it will appear basically dead.</p>

        <p>The "LocoNet Simulator" was created to make it possible
        to use JMRI in a disconnected mode. This is useful e.g. if
        you want to develop a panel while away from your
        layout.</p>

        <p>To use the LocoNet Simulator, select it as your layout
        connection in the preferences, save the preferences, quit
        and restart the program. You should then be able to access
        LocoNet items such as Turnouts, Sensors, Signals, etc. Some
        of the more advanced features, such as the BDL168
        programmer, will not fully function, but you should be able
        to do all the steps to build and edit panels.</p>

        <p>When your computer is connected to the LocoNet again,
        you can change the preferences to the proper connection,
        e.g. a LocoBuffer-USB, and use the panel you've
        created.</p>

        <h2>Hex files</h2>The simulator can also read and playback
        hex traces of LocoNet activity to see how the program will
        react to them. Each line in the trace is a single LocoNet
        packet in hexadecimal characters. You can create one of
        these by for example turning on the "show raw data" option
        in a LocoNet Monitor window, and having the monitor write
        to a log file. You'll have to edit the resulting file to
        remove the human readable lines, leaving just the hex raw
        data.<br>
        An example hex file is shown here:

        <p><code>A1 0B 00 55 &crarr;</code></p>
        <pre>
B0 2D 10 72 &crarr;
</pre>
        <pre>
BB 10 00 54 &crarr;
</pre>

        <p>Note that each hex value must be two valid hexadecimal
        characters plus a space. Each message (line) must be
        terminated by a carriage return. Note that there is a space
        immediately before the carriage return!</p>

        <p>The sequence above would result in the following LocoNet
        traffic, shown as decoded by the LocoNet Monitor tool (with
        Raw Data displayed):</p>
        <pre>
[A1 0B 00 55]  Set loco in slot 11 direction to FWD, F0=Off, F1=Off, F2=Off, F3=Off, F4=Off.
</pre>
        <pre>
[B0 2D 10 72]  Requesting Switch at LT46 () to Thrown (output On).
</pre>
        <pre>
[BB 10 00 54]  Request data/status for slot 16.
</pre>

        <p>Because there is no Command Station, the last message
        would not receive a response.</p>
