      <h1>Hardware Support: Connecting a LocoBuffer-II to
      LocoNet&reg;</h1>

      <p>The LocoBuffer-II provides a very reliable way to connect
      a computer serial port to a LocoNet&reg;. It was produced by
      Dick Bronson's <a href=
      "http://www.rr-cirkits.com">RR-CirKits</a> company, based in
      part on the original LocoBuffer design, but is currently out
      of production. You might be able to find one in a local hobby
      shop. It's been replaced by the <a href=
      "LocoBufferUSB.shtml">LocoBuffer-USB</a>, which uses a USB
      connection.</p>

      <h2>Recommended setup</h2>

      <p>The recommended LocoBuffer-II option switch settings
      are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>19,200 baud or 57,600 baud</li>

        <li>RS-232 echo off</li>

        <li>LocoBuffer mode</li>

        <li>ICSP Program Mode off</li>

        <li>Boot Program Mode off</li>

        <li>Isolated power (<a href="#locoBufferIIPower">see
        below</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The recommended JMRI setup for the LocoBuffer-II is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Set all switches off (toward the front label
        side).</li>

        <li>Connect the LocoBuffer-II to a suitable power supply,
        for example a wall-wart of the correct voltage.</li>

        <li>Start DecoderPro or other program and configure it for:

          <ul>
            <li>LocoNet LocoBuffer-II</li>

            <li>Select your port</li>

            <li>19,200 baud or 57,600 baud, to match the
            LocoBuffer-II internal option switch settings</li>

            <li>Hardware flow control</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Loop-back testing</h2>

      <p>The LocoBuffer-II input circuit and code actually reads
      from the LocoNet output jack, so if you install the LocoNet
      terminator (the small circuit that was shipped with the
      LocoBuffer-II) and set SW7-8 to ON (down) so that the input
      circuitry gets it's power from the wall-wart, then you have
      created a loop back test. The only thing that is not tested
      is the LocoNet jack itself.</p>

      <p>Steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Unplug The LocoNet cable</li>

        <li>Open case (use a small screw driver to work open the
        latches at the small slots on the sides)</li>

        <li>Install terminator</li>

        <li>Set Sw 7-8 ON, all other switches OFF</li>

        <li>Set the JMRI LocoBuffer options to 19,200 baud and
        hardware handshaking enabled</li>

        <li>Open the JMRI LocoNet Monitor window.</li>

        <li>Using JMRI send some commands (e.g. switch
        commands)</li>

        <li>The commands should appear in the LocoNet monitor
        window and the LocoBuffer-II activity LED should blink</li>

        <li>Remove the terminator (unless your application requires
        it)</li>

        <li>Restore the LocoBuffer-II option switches to their
        normal settings for your application</li>
      </ol>

      <h2><a name="locoBufferIIPower" id=
      "locoBufferIIPower">LocoBuffer-II Power</a></h2>When powered
      by an external supply, the LocoBuffer-II completely isolates
      your computer from the LocoNet, removing the possibility of
      ground currents flowing through the LocoNet cable.

      <p>If you are using an isolated computer, for example a
      laptop that's not connected to any peripherals, you can
      configure the LocoBuffer-II for "Local Power" so that it
      doesn't need an external power supply. It will then get it's
      power from the RailSync leads in the LocoNet.</p>

      <p>It is strongly advised that you get your computer
      connection working properly with an external power source in
      "Isolated Power" mode before you do this. That way, if any
      problems arise when you try to use Internal Power, you'll
      know what caused them and they'll be much easier to
      diagnose.</p>

      <p>To configure the LocoBuffer-II for "Local Power", remove
      the power connection and set switches 7 and 8 to ON (down,
      toward the switch illustration).</p>
