      <h1>Hardware Support: Powerline - System Names</h1>
      Individual inputs (Sensors) and outputs (Turnouts and
      Lights) in JMRI are accessed via System Names.<br>
      For information on the general scheme, please see <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">JMRI Naming</a> in the
      <a href="../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">Technical
      documentation</a>. <a name="hardware" id="hardware"></a>

      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <h3>X10</h3>
      X10 devices are addressed via a "House Code" of A
      through P, and a "Device Code" of 1 through 16.

      <p>Outputs (Lights or Turnouts) in each House Code are
      numbered with their Device Code, e.g.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>PTA1 is a JMRI Turnout that talks to device 1 on
        housecode A</li>

        <li>PTB3 is a JMRA Turnout for device 3 on housecode B</li>

        <li>PLP16 is a JMRI Light for device 16 on housecode P</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If an output is called as a Turnout (name starts with
      PT-), you only get On and Off as output options.</p>

      <p>An output that is used as a Light (name starts with PL-)
      will take variable intensities. However, some physical X10
      devices may not support dimming.</p>

      <p>Inputs (Sensors) are identified by the house code and
      device number that was reported by some other X10 device like
      a motion sensor or light control pad.<br>
      NOTE: Due to a large number of false codes experienced by X10
      users, Sensors are not automatically generated. They must be
      manually entered in the Sensor Table by the user.</p>

      <p>JMRI configures the adapter to use House Code "A" now.
      We'll eventually make that configurable, but for now that
      means that input messages will only be received from devices
      set to House Code A, so only sensors "PSA1" through "PSA16"
      will work.<br>
      (Early versions of JMRI X10 support used an all-numeric
      address like PT12, with no House Code letters; this is no
      longer available, because it caused way too much
      confusion)</p>

      <h3>Insteon</h3>
      Insteon Adapters are labelled with a
      three-part number that looks like "01.2A.B4". These are just
      random strings as far as the user and the program is
      concerned, and we don't make any effort to subdivide them.
      You should enter these exactly as they appear on the device
      you want to address. Do not delete or add leading zeros, etc.

      <p>For example, if the device is labelled "01.2A.B4", the
      corresponding JMRI Light System Name is "PL01.2A.B4".

      <h3>Adding an item to the table</h3>
      <p>When you add an item to one of the tables, many times you only
        have to fill in the numbers to have JMRI construct
        the complete system name.<br>
        Here's a summary, split up for
        outputs (eg. Turnouts) and inputs (eg. Sensors):</p>

      <table>
        <tbody><tr>
          <th>In/Out</th>
          <th>Entry</th>
          <th>Meaning</th>
          <th>makes System Name</th>
          <th>Mask</th>
          <th>Minimum</th>
          <th>Maximum</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>i/o</td>
          <td>A3</td>
          <td>House code A + num device code</td>

          <td>caps letter + num</td>
          <td>house code: A; device: 1</td>
          <td>house code: P; device: 16</td>
        </tr>

          <td>PL01.2A.B4</td>
          <td>3 x 2 chars</td>
          <td>not documented</td>
          <td> </td>
