      <h1>Hardware Support: Using a PDA to access JMRI
      (deprecated)</h1>

      <p>This page describes an early attempt to connect an Axim
      PDA to JMRI, which has some flaws and is deprecated. <a name=
      "limitations" id="limitations"></a></p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <p>For a supported approach, involving running a specific
      program on your Smartphone, see the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml">WiThrottle</a>
      page. <a name="connecting" id="connecting"></a></p>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <p>Daryl Kruse has been experimenting with a Dell Axim PDA
      for use as a true 2-way Digitrax throttle. He's provided the
      following information on how he set it up:</p>

      <p>1. Our home has a wireless LAN set up for household
      members to access our cable internet service.</p>

      <p>2. My train computer is connected to our LAN and, of
      course, is connected to JMRI and the LocoNet via an
      interface.</p>

      <p>3. My Dell Axim has wireless and terminal services
      client.</p>

      <p>4. After staring up JMRI Throttles and turnout control, I
      use the terminal services client of the Axim to access
      the computer screen.</p>

      <p>5. I can then control the layout with the Axim.</p>

      <p>I am using the Terminal Services Client that came
      installed on my Axim x50v which came with windows mobile 2003
      SE installed as the operating system. On the computer I check
      the box "allow users to connect remotely to this computer" in
      the control panel/systems/remote tab.</p>

      <p>The main, four way button of the Axim can be used to
      increase (left) and decrease (right) speed and set the
      direction of the train (up- forward, down-reverse). I use the
      blunt end of my home made uncoupling pic to address the
      screen in order to select and dispatch locos, operate
      functions and set turnouts. All this can be done without ever
      plugging into the LocoNet.</p>

      <p>One thing that is a little bit cumbersome is entering the
      turnout numbers into the turnout control. For this I have to
      use the Axim keyboard. I would like to use the turnout table,
      but every accessory switch that is used shows up
      automatically on the table. As I use Route control, a lot of
      unneeded accessory switch numbers show up that I don't need.
      Is there any way to set up a table that is set with just the
      accessory switches you want? <a name="documentation" id=
      "documentation"></a></p>
