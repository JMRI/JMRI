      <h1>Hardware Support: Maple Systems</h1><a href=
      "http://www.maplesystems.com/images/silverseries/SilverSeries_7-16-07.jpg"><img src="http://www.maplesystems.com/images/silverseries/SilverSeries_7-16-07.jpg"

      <a href="http://www.maplesystems.com/">Maple Systems</a>
      makes several series of <a href=
      "http://www.maplesystems.com/products/silverseries/silverseries_ezw.htm">
      touchscreen panels</a> that can be very useful on model
      railroads.

      <p>Each panel is really a standalone (Windows) computer. It's
      configured and loaded using the <a href=
      "http://www.maplesystems.com/products/graphic-hmi/tabmenu-features/faq/index.html#collapse-1-5">
      EZware configuration program</a> provided by Maple Systems.
      That configuration defines the displays, button labels and
      locations, etc. <a name="limitations" id=
      "limitations"></a></p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <p>This is still in the very early stages, so details are
      changing rapidly. If you want to use these devices, please
      contact the JMRI developers. <a name="connecting" id=
      "connecting"></a></p>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <h3>Settings</h3>

      <p>JMRI interacts with the Maple panel through input and
      output bits (called "coils", as in relay coils) within the
      panel. The panel configuration can set these in response to
      various events. JMRI provides Sensor objects that make them
      available for triggering actions within JMRI. JMRI can
      defines Turnout objects which can set them, in which case the
      panel configuration can change what's being displayed.</p>

      <p>You have to configure a Maple Systems Node into JMRI with
      the "Configure Nodes" button on the JMRI Preferences pane. On
      the pane that opens, enter the Node number (e.g. 1 or 2, etc)
      into the "UA" field, and click "Add". Leave all the rest
      alone; the Maple Support was created from the JMRI C/MRI
      support, and as of JMRI version 2.3.7 the migration is not
      complete.</p>

      <h4>Naming</h4>

      <p>The system letter for Maple connections in JMRI is
      "K".</p>

      <p>You configure the Maple Systems device to use one of the
      supported speeds (set on the JMRI Preferences pane for Maple
      connections), and to use the "Simple ASCII Protocol". More
      information on the protocol and how to configure the Maple
      Systems device is on Maple <a href=
      "http://www.maplesystems.com/1033/10330073.PDF">PDF data
      sheet</a>.</p>

      <p>JMRI communicates with the Maple Systems device by reading
      and writing "discrete memory" locations, otherwise known as
      "LB" registers.</p>

      <p>LB registers 1 through 48 are available to JMRI as input
      "Sensors" 1 to 48.</p>

      <p>LB registers 1001 through 1048 are available to JMRI as
      output "Turnouts" 1 through 48.</p>

      <p>The Maple Systems node number (programmed into "Parameter
      5", the "HMI station ID #") can be 1 through 99. It appears
      as the thousands digit of JMRI Sensors and Turnouts System
      Names. For example, KS3001 is the 1st sensor on node 3, and
      would therefore be LB 1 in that Maple Systems unit. KT3001 is
      the 1st turnout on that node, and would therefore be LB 101
      in that unit.</p>

      <p>Here's a summary of the options per Connection, split up for
      outputs (eg. Turnouts) and inputs (eg. Sensors):</p>
