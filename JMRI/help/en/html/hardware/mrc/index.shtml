      <h1>Hardware Support: MRC/GaugeMaster Prodigy
      Advanced<sup>2</sup></h1>

      <p>Please download the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/download/index.shtml">latest JMRI
      release</a> to get the most recent version of JMRI's
      MRC/GaugeMaster support. Support for MRC Prodigy is available
      starting with <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri3.9.1.shtml">JMRI version
      3.9.1</a>.</p>

      <p>In the UK the MRC systems is rebranded, rebadged and sold
      by Gaugemaster. The two systems are exactly the same in
      operation and components. <a name="connecting" id=
      "connecting"></a></p>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <p>JMRI can connect to an MRC Prodigy Advanced<sup>2</sup>
      command station via the USB Computer interface (MRC:1516 or
      Gaugemaster:DCC55). This has been tested with the wired and
      wireless versions of the interface.</p>

      <p>JMRI should be able to support all of the MRC Prodigy
      range of systems, however it has only been tested and
      developed with the Advanced<sup>2</sup>.</p>

      <h3>Settings</h3>

      <p>To configure the connection:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the JMRI "Preferences" under the "Edit" menu,</li>

        <li>Select "MRC" as the System Manufacturer.</li>

        <li>Select "Serial" as the System Connection.</li>

        <li>Select the Serial Port associated with the system.</li>

        <li>Select the Cab Address that will be allocated to the
        interface.<br>
        Please note that this must be unique and not used by any
        other handset, if you are to use a number above 8, then you
        must refer to Prodigy instructions to ensure that the
        system is configured to address the cab correctly</li>

        <li>Click "Save".</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Programming, Turnout, Throttle and Power support is
      available for a JMRI-connected Prodigy unit.</p>

      <h3>Programming Decoders</h3>JMRI provides full support for
      the reading/writing of decoders on the Programming along with
      the ability to write changes to a decoder "On the Main".

      <p>Please note that the Prodigy Command Station will
      automatically determine the programming mode (ie. Direct
      Byte/Direct Bit/Paged).</p>

      <h3>Throttles</h3>The JMRI interface supports both 28 &amp;
      128 speed steps and all 28 functions.<br>
      If another handset has control of the same Locomotive that a
      JMRI Throttle has, the changes made by the second Throttle
      will be reflected on the JMRI Throttle.

      <p><b>Support for 14 speed steps has NOT been included.<br>
      Consisting is NOT currently supported</b></p>

      <h3>Turnouts</h3>MRC-connected Turnouts have System Names
      like "MT123", where "M" is the name for MRC System, "T"
      means Turnout, and "123" is the address.

      <h3>MRC Routes</h3>Triggering of MRC system Routes is
      supported in JMRI. This is done by adding a Turnout with the
      Route number + 1000, eg. for MRC Route 15, you would add a
      JMRI Turnout with an address of MRT1015.

      <p>JMRI does not support editing/adding/removal of system
      Routes stored in the MRC. <a name="tools" id="tools"></a></p>
