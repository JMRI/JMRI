      <h1>JMRI: PanelPro</h1>
      The JMRI libraries contain the PanelPro
      application for creating control panels. This page describes
      the application, and how to use it.

      <p>PanelPro provides four separate ways to create Control
      Panels:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="#pe">Panel Editor</a> lets you graphically
        draw a Panel exactly the way you want it, and then animate
        parts of it to show the status of your layout and let you
        click to control it.</li>

        <li>The <a href="#cpe">Control Panel Editor</a> works like
        Panel Editor but provides an alternative interface.</li>

        <li>The <a href="#le">Layout Editor</a> provides tools to
        make a smart schematic of your layout while constructing
        the logic for signals, etc. This constrains how the panel
        appears a little, but it can save significant time when
        first bringing your layout up.</li>

        <li><a href="#swb">Switchboard Editor</a> is a graphic,
        straightforward control interface, showing a range of switch
        keys to watch and control items.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Which to use: Layout Editor or Panel Editor?</h2>

      <p>The Layout Editor builds a "Layout" which is a <i>logical
      description</i> of your entire layout. You only have a single
      Layout, otherwise it is not possible for the software to
      connect track elements together across the boundaries between
      multiple Layouts. A Layout, built with the Layout Editor, can
      be used for directly controlling elements such as Turnouts
      and Signals; indeed many users find it very suitable for this
      task. But, it is primarily designed for automation and
      semi-automation within JMRI. For example, you can use the
      Layout Editor to construct a description of your track and
      its blocks and signals. The software can automatically work
      out how to set your signals based on the position of turnouts
      and whether blocks are occupied, and the rules appropriate to
      your railroad (ie. select the signal rules based on different
      company practices!, and no need to know how to create the
      rules to link your signals to the state of turnouts, blocks
      and other signals !). Layout Editor Panels may also be used to
      set up automatic running of trains on your layout using <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a>.
      In addition, the Layout description of your railway can be
      used by scripts such as the included
      <a href="../..//tools/scripting/Examples.shtml">AutoDispatcher2</a>
      to automatically control your trains. There are many other
      tools within JMRI which require a description of your
      railroad and the description comes from the Layout built in
      the Layout Editor. The Layout Editor has many rules built
      into it about how track is connected, the naming of blocks,
      etc.. In order to function, there are constraints on the
      appearance of track elements and how they are used.</p>

      <p>The (Control) Panel Editor builds <i>graphical</i> control
      Panels. You can have as many Panels as you like, covering as
      much or as little of your railway as you like, with overlaps
      in area or functionality if required. Panels might be
      diagrams showing the state of the track and signals, or they
      might be prototypical signaling and dispatcher panels. Or
      anything else you find useful to control your railroad; you
      have total flexibility over their appearance. There are
      several standard graphics sets distributed with JMRI, but it
      is often necessary to make some of the elements in an
      external graphics package to be imported as GIF or PNG files.
      These might include the Panel Background, or the icons to attach
      to active elements (switches, levers, track state, signals,
      etc.) which are then placed on the Panel.<br>
      Control Panel Editor supports using
      <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/logix/Warrant.shtml">
      Warrants</a> and automatic running of trains.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "http://quaker-valley.com/CTC/JMRI%20Panel%20Tutorial.gif">
      <img src="http://quaker-valley.com/CTC/JMRI%20Panel%20Tutorial.gif"
      align="right" height="216" width="313"></a> Many people use
      both, with the Layout Editor creating schematic panels to
      handle the actual configuration for signals and Panel Editor
      providing exactly the appearance desired. For example, Bob
      Bucklew has prepared a three part <a href=
      "http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/JMRI_Panel_Tutorial.html">tutorial</a>
      that describes how Panel Pro and Layout Editor can be used
      together.</p>

      <p>The Switchboard is easier to set up, using a simple grid
      of pre-defined buttons or indicators. It is limited to the
      basic inputs (Sensors) and Outputs (Turnouts and Lights).</p>

      <p>Please see our <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/community/examples/Gallery.shtml">Gallery
      page</a> for examples of how model railroaders have used this
      on their own layouts. There's also an example of using
      PanelPro for <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/community/examples/Modules.shtml">modular
      layouts</a>.</p>

      <p>Rodney Black's <a href="http://cats4ctc.org/">CATS</a>
      application is another tool for creating modern-style Control
      Panels.</p>

      <h2><a name="pe" id="pe">The Panel Editor</a></h2>
      <a href=
      "../../../images/CornwallPanelLit.gif"><img src=
      "../../../images/CornwallPanelLit.gif" alt=
      "screen shot of Cornwall panel" width="333" height="200"
      hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>

      <p>With the JMRI Panel Editor, you can make a control panel
      look and operate any way you want.</p>

      <p>A panel is one or more background pictures, on which are
      drawn icons to represent Turnouts, Sensors and Signals on the
      layout. You can build the background from small icons (as in
      the image above left), or provide a detailed drawing that you
      created in a drawing program (image above right).</p>

      <p>You can use these tools to configure quite complicated
      panels for large layouts. The example above is from <a href=
      "http://kc.pennsyrr.com/layouts/kulp/index.html">Nick Kulp's
      Cornwall Railroad</a>. There's a <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/community/examples/Panels-Cornwall/Cornwall.html">
      page on the main web site</a> that describes this in detail.
      There's also a <a href=
      "http://ownry.squarespace.com/blog/2011/4/7/ctc-dispatcher-panel-on-the-ownry.html?SSScrollPosition=0">
      page describing the panel</a> for Kent Williams's <a href=
      "http://ownry.squarespace.com/modelrailroad/">Oregon
      Washington Navigation &amp; Railway</a>. Robert Bucklew's
      Quaker Valley Lines is also building a <a href=
      "http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/QV_CTCnew.html">CTC
      panel</a> using PanelPro. (This is a second generation panel
      with some advanced features; there's also a page describing
      the <a href=
      "http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/QV_CTC.html">older, simpler
      panel</a>)_</p>

      <p>Also, refer to the <a href=
      "../../tools/signaling/index.shtml">signaling page</a> for
      information on adding logic to operate the signals on your
      layout under the control of your panel.</p>

      <h3>Panel operation</h3>Clicking on a turnout symbol flips it
      from closed to thrown and vice-versa. A turnout also has
      "unknown" and "inconsistent" states, represented by an icon
      with a question mark and X respectively. These represent a
      state where no information has been received, and where the
      information is internally inconsistent (e.g. both closed and
      thrown at the same time).

      <p>This control can be used in various ways. For example, you
      could have a turnout icon covering a turnout on a schematic
      diagram. When you click on it, the turnout on the layout
      would be commanded to change, and the track diagram would
      show which way a train would be routed. Or you could use
      icons that show a lever to the right or left, and create a
      panel that looks like a traditional US&amp;S panel.</p>

      <p>"Sensors" can be used to represent occupancy indicators or
      other inputs. The default icon is a small circle, with color
      used to represent the state of the sensor. These respond to
      changes on the layout automatically. Clicking on a sensor
      causes the sensor to alternate between "active" and
      "inactive" states. With the default icons, active is a green
      circle and inactive is an empty circle. These are meant to
      represent a lit/dark panel indicator. A red circle represents
      the "unknown" state, used when no information has yet been
      received from the layout.</p>

      <h3>Creating a panel</h3>These are made with a "Panel
      Editor", which allows you to place images to represent
      turnouts, sensors (on some systems) and trackwork.

      <p>The rest of this page gives you a walk-through of the
      process. If you'd like to see animated clinics that show how
      each of these things are actually done on the computer
      screen, please see <a href=
      "http://www.rr-cirkits.com/Clinics/Clinics.html">Dick
      Bronson's clinics page</a>.</p>

      <p>You start the editor by selecting "New Panel..." then
      "Panel Editor" from the "Panels" menu on the main window.
      You'll get a blank control panel, plus the editor window:<br>
      <a href="../../../images/paneleditor.gif"><img src=
      "../../../images/paneleditor.gif" alt=
      "Screen shot of panel editor" width="208" height="364"
      hspace="0" vspace="0" align="right"></a></p>

      <p>From the top, this contains:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Two text fields specifying where (in pixels) new
        components will be inserted on the panel. You can generally
        ignore these, as once the components has been inserted you
        can drag it around by holding the meta (Apple, command,
        etc) key down.</li>

        <li>A button to pick a background image. The editor's
        drawing capability is rudimentary and likely to stay that
        way for a long time. To create CTC panels, complex track
        diagrams, etc, its easier to draw them in some other
        program and insert them as the background image for a JMRI
        control panel.</li>

        <li>A button to add a text label. Put the desired text in
        the field and click the button. You can slide the label
        around after inserting it, but you currently can't edit the
        text later.</li>

        <li>A button to add an icon as a label. This is a way to
        add track symbols, etc. To select the icon, click the "edit
        icon..." button to pop an icon editor panel.<br>
        <a href="../../../images/iconeditor.gif"><img src=
        "../../../images/iconeditor.gif" alt=
        "Screen shot of icon editor" width="148" height="214"
        hspace="0" vspace="0" align="right"></a><br>
        The current icon is shown at the top. To change it, use the
        tree in the bottom of the window to select a new one, then
        click on the icon at the top of the icon editor panel to
        load the selected icon. This is a general mechanism: Any
        icon on an icon editor window can be replaced by selecting
        the desired new one and clicking on the icon to be
        replaced.</li>

        <li>Two sections for adding left- and right-bound turnouts.
        These actually work the same way, only with different icons
        to represent the states of the turnouts. Enter the turnout
        number (e.g. 23) and click "Add turnout:". If you'd prefer
        a different graphic for the closed and thrown states, you
        can change their icons as described above.</li>

        <li>A section for adding a sensor. Type the sensor number
        (e.g. 74) in the field and click "Add sensor:".</li>
      </ul>There are also buttons to add more advanced objects,
      including a clock face, and checkboxes that control the
      operation of the panel. More information about these is
      available on the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelEditor.shtml">Panel
      Editor help page</a>.

      <p>After getting the Panel the way you want, you can use the
      "Store panel..." entry in the "Panels" menu to write it to an
      .xml file. More information about the <a href=
      "../../setup/Files.shtml">JMRI Configuration Files</a></p>

      <h3>Available Icons</h3>The JMRI library contains lots of
      contributed icons for representing CTC panels, LEDs, etc. You
      can browse through them with the tree in the bottom of the
      editor frame. Perhaps the best way to see what each looks
      like is to select it in the tree, then click on the icon next
      to the "Add icon" button. That will load it.

      <p>You can also create your own icons and use them by
      selecting from the "file" section.</p>

      <p>For little bits of track, e.g. to connect turnouts, you
      might want</p>
      <pre>
 resources -&gt; icons -&gt; small schematics -&gt;tracksegments
</pre>then block.gif, etc.

      <p>We do need to do a better job of organizing the available
      icons!</p>

      <h3>Manipulating Icons</h3>To move an icon around on the
      panel, you "meta-drag" it. On a Mac, that's "hold the cmd key
      and drag with the cursor"; on windows, it might be the
      Windows or control key. Or it might be a right-drag. Sorry, I
      don't have a Windows machine here to figure it out.

      <p>There's also a pop-up menu (ctrl-click on a Mac) that will
      provide various ways to manipulate the icon. It will let you
      rotate the icon so that it points in whatever direction you
      want. Text labels can have their font, size and color
      changed. You can also remove icons from the panel with the
      popup menu.</p>

      <h3>Other types of panels</h3>Because this is icon-based, you
      can create panels that look any way you want. For example,
      instead of using track-schematic icons for turnouts, you
      could use small images of the levers and plates on CTC
      machine. This would give you "mechanical" levers you can flip
      back and forth with a click. This can be made absolutely
      prototypical, or can be simplified for easier and faster
      operation, as you prefer.

      <p>It's also possible to create a panel where the "track"
      lines change color to indicate whether the track is occupied.
      The procedure for doing that is described on a <a href=
      "ColorTrack.shtml">separate page</a>. <a name="cpe" id=
      "cpe"></a></p>

      <h2>The Control Panel Editor</h2>

      <p><b>Control Panel Editor</b> is simply an alternative view
      and controller with the same content data as <b>Panel
      Editor</b>. Control Panel Editor allows you to edit a Panel
      using menus instead of a separate editing window.</p>

      <p>For more information, see the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/ControlPanelEditor.shtml">
      Control Panel Editor help page</a>. <a name="le" id=
      "le"></a></p>

      <h2>The Layout Editor</h2><a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/EnhancedPanel.gif"><img src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/EnhancedPanel.gif"
      align="right" alt="screen shot of layout editor panel" width=
      "296" height="86" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a> The <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout
      Editor</a> helps you create simple schematic panels, while
      simultaneously setting up the block and signal logic needed
      to operate the layout. Its strength is its ability to capture
      how the tracks are connected, where each block is located and
      how each signal is related to blocks. On the other hand, it
      provides only limited ability to customize how the panel
      appears.

      <p><a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif">
      <img src=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif"
      align="right" alt="screen shot of layout editor panel" width=
      "271" height="85" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a> You edit via
      "Edit Mode", which makes the connections between elements and
      the layout visible (See figure to the right). For example,
      you can click on the circle in the middle of a track segment
      and select the associated occupancy detector (Sensor) on the
      layout. Once you've done that, the color of the track segment
      on the screen will change when the track is occupied. You can
      configure the colors used, the width of the track lines, and
      other details of the presentation.</p>

      <h2><a name="swb" id="swb">The Switchboard Editor</a></h2>
      <p>Switchboards provide a visual control grid for your JMRI layout "out of the box".<br>
      To create a new Switchboard, from the Panels menu, choose New Panel &gt;
      Switchboard Editor.</p>
      <p>For more information, please see the
      <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/SwitchboardEditor.shtml">
      Switchboard Editor help page</a>.</p>

      <h2>Communicating with Multiple Systems</h2>

      <p>PanelPro can communicate with more than one layout control
      system. For example, the Cornwall Railroad mentioned above
      uses C/MRI hardware for sensing the status of blocks and
      turnouts on the layout, but drives turnout positions through
      a Digitrax DCC system.</p>

      <p>To configure the program to talk to multiple systems, add
      both in JMRI Preferences using the + tab on the Connections
      pane. For more information, see the <a href=
      "../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Preferences
      panel Help page</a>.</p>

      <p>If you add a turnout, sensor or signal to a panel using
      just a number, e.g. "23", it will be assigned to the first
      system on the Preference panel. To access the 2nd system, you
      have to use JMRI <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">System Names</a>. For
      example, if the second attachment is to a LocoNet system,
      you'd refer to a LocoNet Turnout as LT13; a LocoNet sensor as
      LS21, etc. See the page on <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Names &amp; Naming</a> for
      more information.</p>
