      <h1>JMRI: Displaying Colored Trackwork</h1>People who model
      modern railroad might want a control panel that shows a
      "schematic" view of the railroad, with individual segments
      changing color to show where trains are occupying the track.
      PanelPro can do this for your panels. There are two basic
      approaches:

      <ul>
        <li>Use the new "<a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout
        Editor</a>" to create your panel. It allows you to <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/EditTrackSegment.shtml">
        draw track segments</a> and <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/EditLayoutTurnout.shtml">
        place turnouts</a> on the screen, then configure them so
        they <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/EditLayoutBlock.shtml">
        change color with occupancy</a>.</li>

        <li>If using the original "Panel Editor", you can also
        configure sensor icons to change the color of your track.
        This technique is described on this page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Background</h3>PanelPro detects the status of things on
      the layout, including whether a track is occupied, using
      "Sensors". Depending on what hardware (DCC system, etc) you
      have on your layout, these might be different devices, but as
      far as the program cares they all basically work the same:
      The tell the program that the block detector is in one of
      four states:

      <ul>
        <li>INACTIVE - The segment of track is empty</li>

        <li>ACTIVE - The segment of track contains all or part of a
        train</li>

        <li>UNKNOWN - The program does not currently know the
        status of this Sensor, typically because the program has
        just started up and hasn't seen a message from it yet</li>

        <li>INCONSISTENT - Some error has happened, and rather than
        giving you a value that might be wrong, we're just saying
        that we're confused</li>
      </ul>For a particular "SensorIcon" at some spot on the
      screen, PanelPro associates a different picture with each of
      these states. When the state changes, the correct picture is
      placed on the screen.

      <p>So the basic problem is getting the correct pictures to
      put on the screen.</p>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Draw the basic background for your panel, including the
        trackwork. Get the colors, positions, etc right, because
        going back to it later will require redoing a couple of
        steps.<br>
        <img src=
        "../../../images/tracksegments/WhiteTrack.gif"></li>

        <li>Take your favorite paint program and cut out the little
        pieces of the image that correspond to blocks. If you've
        got multiple blocks of the exact same shape and size, you
        don't have to make separate copies of them.<br>
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/WhiteArc.gif">
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/WhiteLine.gif">
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/WhiteTO.gif"></li>

        <li>You'll use those to make colored images to show
        occupancy. For example, if you want to have yellow indicate
        occupied track, white indicate unoccupied track, and red
        indicate errors, you need to copy those new images and
        create versions with the appropriate colors. (Note: Make
        sure to keep a copy of the original little image for any
        track segments that contains a turnout)<br>
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/YellowArc.gif">
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/RedArc.gif">
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/WhiteArc.gif"></li>

        <li>Now create the panel using these images, as described
        in the <a href="PanelPro.shtml">tutorials</a>.</li>
      </ol>For turnouts, the situation is a little more
      complicated. Most people want to represent <i>both</i> the
      occupancy <i>and</i> the position of the turnout. We need a
      couple more steps to do that.

      <ol>
        <li>Create sensor images for the trackwork as described
        above.<br>
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/YellowTO.gif">
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/RedTO.gif">
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/WhiteTO.gif"></li>

        <li>Now, we create images that will modify those to show
        the turnout position. We want to create images that are
        transparent where the trackwork is, except for a little
        more background color to represent the position of the
        turnout.<br>
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/TranTOc.gif">
        <img src="../../../images/tracksegments/TranTOt.gif"><br>
        Here the gray color represents transparent parts of the
        image; if we put it over one of the sensor images, the
        sensor's track color will shine through.</li>

        <li>Now create the panel using these images, as described
        in the <a href="PanelPro.shtml">tutorials</a>. The normal
        operation (which we'll change below) is to have sensors in
        front of turnouts on the screen. That means it'll be easier
        if you add and position the turnout icons first, then the
        sensor icons.</li>

        <li>To move the sensor icons behind the turnout icons, you
        have to edit the panel file and change their "level". Open
        your file in a text editor (Not Microsoft Word, which will
        try to interpret the XML and do amazingly stupid
        things).</li>

        <li>Find the lines for your sensor and turnout by looking
        for the name of the sensor and turnout, e.g. LS33 and
        LT120. You find two lines (which may be separated,
        depending on how you created the panel) that look like
        this:
          <pre>
            &lt;turnouticon turnout="LT120" x="20" y="30" level="7" closed="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/os-righthand-west-closed.gif" thrown="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/os-righthand-west-thrown.gif" unknown="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/os-righthand-west-unknown.gif" inconsistent="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/os-righthand-west-error.gif" rotate="0" forcecontroloff="false" class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.TurnoutIconXml" /&gt;
            &lt;sensoricon sensor="LS33" x="20" y="30" level="10" active="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-occupied.gif" inactive="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-empty.gif" unknown="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-error.gif" inconsistent="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-error.gif" rotate="0" forcecontroloff="false" momentary="false" class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.SensorIconXml" /&gt;
        
</pre>Note the "level" attributes that are set to 7 and 10
respectively. (Higher numbers are more toward the "front", and hide
things with "lower" values.) Just swap those values, and save the
file.
        </li>
      </ol>Since you cut the little images from your track diagram,
      it should all go back together seamlessly on the screen.

      <p>Now that panel should show icons for the occupancy sensor
      and turnout that work independently to show both the position
      (by following the line) and the occupancy (through the color)
      of that turnout.</p>
