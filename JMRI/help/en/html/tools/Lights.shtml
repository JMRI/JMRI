      <h2>What are Lights?</h2>

      <p>Lights are digital output bits that function as on/off
      switches. Lights were created to provide easy control for
      fascia panel lights and scenery lighting. Lights can also be
      used for any purpose that requires an on/off switch. A light
      can be used, for example, to activate an electromagnetic
      decoupler for a pre-determined time in response to a fascia
      panel button. Originally developed for use with C/MRI, Lights
      currently are also implemented on LocoNet (Digitrax), Oaktree
      and MERG CBUS systems.</p>

      <p>Lights share available digital output bits with Turnouts.
      Either a Light or a Turnout, but not both, can control a
      specific digital output bit. Since Lights lack the feedback
      structure of Turnouts, Lights should not be used to control
      track switches (Turnouts) on the layout; only Turnouts should
      be used to control track switches. For historical reasons,
      Signal Head appearances are defined using Turnouts, even
      though they may actually be physical lights. So Turnouts
      should be used to reference the digital output bits used with
      JMRI Signal Heads. Lights should be used if you need a simple
      mechanism to control scenery lighting or panel lights, or for
      other on/off tasks where the control mechanisms of Lights fit
      the need.</p>

      <p>Optionally a Light may be controlled in one of four ways:
      it may be controlled by a Sensor, by a Turnout, by the JMRI
      Fast Clock, or switched on for a specified Time by a sensor.
      When a Light is created, or when it is read from a
      configuration file, the Light is 'activated'; it is set up to
      automatically monitor any changes in state of its control
      Sensor, Turnout, or Fast Clock. When the controlling Sensor,
      Turnout, or Fast Clock changes in a user-specified way, the
      Light is switched on or off. Lights can also be controlled by
      <a href="Logix.shtml">Logix</a>, if more complicated control
      logic is needed.</p>

      <p>The Light Table contains an 'Enabled' column. For a Light
      to be triggered by its control Sensor, its control Turnout or
      the Fast Clock it must be "enabled", that is, its check box
      in the 'Enabled' column must be checked. You can uncheck this
      box to temporarily disable a Light from being triggered, i.e.
      prevent it switching when its control mechanism fires.</p>

      <h2>How to setup Lights</h2>

      <h3>The Light Table</h3>

      <p>Lights are created and edited in the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightTable.shtml">Light
      Table</a>.<br>
      It contains the following columns:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>System Name</li>

        <li>User Name (optional)</li>

        <li>State</li>

        <li>Comment (optional, double click to edit)</li>

        <li>Enabled</li>

        <li>Intensity</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Light Table Controls</h3>

      <p>Below the Light Table there's an <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
      button.</p>

      <p>In each line of the table is an Edit and a Delete
      button.</p>

      <h3>Switching a Light On or Off</h3>

      <p>Lights may be turned on or off by clicking the button in
      the State column of the Light Table. A Light may be set up to
      follow the state of a track switch (Turnout), On when the
      Turnout is Closed, and Off when it is Thrown, or vice versa.
      A Light may be set to follow the state of a Block occupancy
      Sensor, On when the Sensor is Active, and Off when it is
      Inactive, or vice versa. A Light may also be set by a fascia
      panel button if a Sensor for that button is defined as the
      Control Sensor. A Light may be configured to follow the JMRI
      Fast Clock, On for a specified time period, then Off. A Light
      may also be controlled from a <a href=
      "Logix.shtml">Logix</a>, as the action of one of its
      Conditionals. If you need more powerful logic to control your
      Light, consider using a <a href="Logix.shtml">Logix</a>.</p>

      <p>Note that enabled/disabled applies only to a Light's
      automated control mechanism. A 'disabled' state will not
      prevent a Light from being turned On or Off using the button
      in the Light Table or from being controlled by a Logix.</p>

      <h3>Saving Lights to disk</h3>

      <p>Lights are saved in your layout configuration file, along
      with Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads, etc. To store this
      information on disk, use <b>Store Configuration...</b> in the
      <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Lights Table (or other
      tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b>
      in the <b>Panel</b> menu. Note that the enabled/disabled
      state of each Light is not saved in the configuration file.
      When Lights are loaded from a configuration file, they are
      all enabled. <a name="addLight" id="addLight"></a></p>

      <h3>Adding a new Light</h3>

      <p>To add a new Light, follow this procedure:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Click the <b>Tools</b> -&gt; <b>Tables</b> -&gt;
        <b>Lights</b> menu to bring up the <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightTable.shtml">Light
        Table</a>, and click the <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom
        of the pane to bring up the <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightAddEdit.shtml">Add/Edit
        Light pane</a>.</li>

        <li>Enter a System Name, according to the JMRI convention.
        The first letter designates your hardware system ('L' for
        LocoNet, 'C" for C/MRI, etc.), and the second letter must
        be 'L' for Light. These are followed by a number that gives
        the hardware address of the digital output bit being
        referenced. Examples of valid system addresses are:
        <code>CL1004</code> and <code>LL401</code>, assuming you
        have the hardware for the addressed digital output
        bits.</li>

        <li>Enter a User Name. Any string of characters that is
        different from the User Name of other Lights will be
        accepted, but it's wise to use a string that describes the
        intended use or layout location of the Light.</li>

        <li>Select the control type from the options in the popup
        menu. When you change the control type, different options
        appear on the two lines below. Control options are
        discussed in more detail <a href=
        "#lightcontrol">below</a>.</li>

        <li>Enter the required information to complete the control
        definition in the fields that appear. If you need to enter
        a Sensor name or a Turnout name, you must enter the name
        (System Name or User Name) of an existing Sensor or
        Turnout. <b>Caution</b>: if you choose to enter a User
        Name, be careful about changing the User Name of your
        Sensor or Turnout afterwards. A simple change of User Name
        could break your Light control definition.</li>

        <li>Next is the notes area of the Add/Edit Light window.
        This is where instructions and error messages will appear
        as you create or edit a Light. Always check this area to
        see if things went as expected.</li>

        <li>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the
        pane. If everything is fine, a message stating "New Light
        added... " will be displayed in the notes area. If there is
        trouble with anything, an error or warning message will be
        displayed in the notes area; you should then correct the
        error and click <b>Create</b> again.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Editing an existing Light</h3>

      <p>To edit an existing Light, follow this procedure:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Edit of an existing Light may be started in either of
        two ways:

          <ul>
            <li>Click on a Light's <b>Edit</b> button in the
            <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightTable.shtml">Light
            Table</a>.</li>

            <li>Enter the System Name of the Light to be edited in
            the <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightAddEdit.shtml">
            Add/Edit Light pane</a> and click the <b>Edit</b>
            button at the bottom of the pane. This must be the same
            as the System Name shown in the Light Table.</li>
          </ul>The <b>Create</b> and <b>Edit</b> buttons at the
          bottom of the Add/Edit Light panel will change to
          <b>Update</b> and <b>Cancel</b>.
        </li>

        <li>Make whatever changes or additions you need to the
        information in the dialog. Note that the System Name of the
        edited Light may not be changed, but the User Name may be
        changed. Other items are as described <a href=
        "#addLight">above</a>.</li>

        <li>After making changes to the Light information, click
        <b>Update</b> to change the selected Light. If everything
        is fine, a message stating "Light updated... " will be
        displayed in the notes area. If there is any trouble, an
        error or warning message will be displayed in the notes
        area, and the update is stopped for you to correct the
        error and click <b>Update</b> again.</li>

        <li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit edit mode without changing
        the selected Light. If the Add/Edit Light panel is
        dismissed (closed) while in edit mode, <b>Cancel</b> is
        automatically selected, and no changes are made to the
        selected Light.</li>
      </ol><a name="lightcontrol" id="lightcontrol"></a>

      <h3>Automated Control Options for Lights</h3>The operation of
      a Light can be controlled in the following ways:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>By Sensor</b> - The Light will be turned on when
          the Control Sensor changes to active or inactive,
          depending upon the choice made in the 'Sense for ON'
          popup menu, and it will be turned off, when the sensor
          reverses state. Specify the Sensor by entering its name
          (System Name or User Name) in the 'Sensor Name' field.
          This option has a number of uses, including setting a
          fascia panel light to follow Block occupancy. That is
          useful, for example, for monitoring train positions in a
          hidden staging area.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>By Fast Clock</b> - The Light will be turned on
          when the Fast Clock reaches the time entered in 'Time On'
          and will be turned off when the Fast Clock reaches the
          time entered in 'Time Off'. The times are entered in
          "hh:mm" format, where "hh" is hours and "mm" is minutes
          for a 24-hour clock. One use of this option is to turn on
          and off scenery lighting, street lights, house lights,
          etc. to simulate night time on the layout.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>By Turnout Status</b> - The Light will be turned on
          when the turnout changes to closed or thrown, depending
          upon the choice made in the 'Status for ON' popup menu,
          and it will be turned off, when the turnout reverses its
          status. Specify the Turnout by entering its name (System
          Name or User Name) in the 'Turnout Name' field. This
          option may be used to set a fascia panel light to follow
          the status of a Turnout. That is useful, for example, for
          monitoring the status of hidden turnouts.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>By Timed ON</b> - The Light will be turned on when
          the trigger Sensor changes to Active, and it will be
          turned off when the specified time has elapsed. Specify
          the trigger Sensor by entering its name (System Name or
          User Name) in the 'Trigger Sensor Name' field. Enter the
          time the Light is to remain on (in milliseconds) in the
          'Duration ON' field. This option has a number of uses, it
          was originally designed to turn on an electromagnetic
          decoupler in response to a fascia pushbutton, but it can
          also be used for other types of layout animation, for
          example, to control the ringing of a crossing bell when a
          Train enters a Block.</p>
        </li>
      </ul><a name="variablelight" id="variablelight"></a>

      <h3>Variable Lights</h3>

      <p>A variable Light allows for a variable number of
      intensities between on and off. The typical use would be for
      layout lighting simulating the changes for the time of day
      and night. Only some forms of Lights have the ability to be
      variable. Examples would include Internal and PowerLine
      devices. A number of configuration options are available for
      variable Lights <a href=
      "#VariableLightSettings">below</a>.</p>

      <p>A variable Light is adjusted by an intensity setting. The
      range of the intensity is from 0.00 for full Off to 1.00
      which is full On. User entry for the intensity will either
      use a floating point value from 0 to 1 or a percentage value
      of 0% to 100%.</p>

      <p>Depending on the hardware used, some variable Lights will
      make an initialization adjustment when switching from simple
      on/off mode to using intensity settings. On such devices this
      will not be needed again as long as <b>only</b> intensity
      setting commands are used. Mixing on/off commands may require
      the initialization to occur again.</p>

      <p>A Variable Light has three types of operators:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><b>On</b></dt>

        <dd>This operation will turn a Variable Light on. It will
        over-ride any current intensity and set the intensity to 1.
        If there are any transition effects enabled, they will be
        ignored and intensity will go to the maximum amount.</dd>

        <dt><b>Off</b></dt>

        <dd>This operation will turn a Variable Light off. It will
        over-ride any current intensity and set the intensity to 0.
        If there are any transition effects enabled, they will be
        ignored and intensity will go to the maximum amount.</dd>

        <dt><b>Set Intensity</b></dt>

        <dd>This operation will set a target intensity for the
        Variable Light. If the interface supports transition
        effects and they are configured, the Light will make a
        controlled transition from the current setting to the new
        setting.</dd>
      </dl><a name="VariableLightSettings" id=
      "VariableLightSettings"></a>

      <h4>Variable Light Settings</h4>

      <p>These settings adjust how the 'set intensity' command is
      used.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><b>Minimum Intensity:</b></dt>

        <dd>A value 0 to 100 (percent) that sets the lowest amount
        of light that will be output by a dim command. An explicit
        Off command will ignore this value.</dd>

        <dt><b>Maximum Intensity:</b></dt>

        <dd>A value 0 to 100 (percent) that sets the highest amount
        of light that will be output by a dim command. An explicit
        On command will ignore this value.</dd>

        <dt><b>Transition Time:</b></dt>

        <dd>Number of Fast Clock minutes to go from 0% to 100%
        intensity. A value of zero will cause the device to change
        from one intensity to new intensity as fast as the device
        is able to do so.</dd>
