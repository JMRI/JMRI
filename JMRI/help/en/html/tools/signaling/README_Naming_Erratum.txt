File naming erratum

Because SHTML file names and paths cannot easily be corrected after they are created in the JMRI code, 
the following files will retain their (wrongly spelled) names:

jmri/help/en/tools/signaling/  (There's a US-English vs UK-English difference here too)


jmri/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ 
SHTML files:
- SignalAddEdit.shtml: describes (only) SignalHeadAddEdit, newer files describe the Signal Masts and Groups so it might in retrospect have been named SignalHeadAddEdit;
- SignalGroupAddEdit.shtml: describes the Signal Groups (plural) Table (and AddEdit);
- SignalGroup.shtml (should read: SignalGroupsTable.shtml, plural as in the name go the Table).

jmri/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/signalling/ 
- The folder itself would be named signaling (1 L) in US english, the spelling for all english help content in JMRI. The double L reveals a British contributor;
- AddEditSignalingLogic.shtml: a full duplicate of the identically named file in the ../beantable/ directory. Keep it up to date!
- SignalingSourceFrame.shtml: the window described on this page is no longer available within JMRI as of version 2.7.3 (2014).
