      <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Launch PanelPro and from the Tools &gt; Tables &gt;
        Turnouts menu add the turnouts on your layout to the
        <a href="../Turnouts.shtml">Turnout Table</a>.</li>

        <li>Next add the physical signals you installed on the
        layout to the <a href="SignalMasts.shtml">Signal Mast
        Table</a>:

          <ol>
            <li>The easiest way: if you are using an accessory
            decoder that can drive the Signal Masts natively and
            supports the NMRA Standard 9.2.1 Extended Accessory
            Protocol (<a href=
            "http://www.nmra.org/sites/default/files/s-9.2.1_2012_07.pdf">PDF</a>)
            just add the Signal Mast using the 'DCC Signal Mast
            Decoder driver' and when prompted, input the Aspect
            numbers configured in your decoder against each Aspect.
            Decoders like the <a href=
            "http://signalist.co.uk">Signalist SC1</a> have
            different Signal Mast types preconfigured and you just
            select the correct table with a CV and get the Aspect
            numbers from the manual. Other decoders will need some
            setting up to define the Aspects to be displayed to an
            Aspect number. See your decoder manual for what to do
            here.</li>

            <li>If you have more basic signal decoders (the
            Digitrax SE8c for example) or a command station that
            does not support the Extended Accessory Protocol (Lenz
            for example) you will first have to configure the
            individual Signal Heads that make up each Signal Mast
            in the Signal Head Table and then go to the Signal Mast
            Table, add the appropriate Signal Mast Type (eg. AAR-2
            Triple Head Searchlight) and configure it using the
            Signal Head Controlled Mast driver, adding in the
            Signal Heads that you have previously defined.</li>
          </ol>Pick one of the available <a href=
          "../../../../../xml/signals/">Signaling Systems</a>, such
          as <a href=
          "../../../../../xml/signals/AAR-1946/aspects.xml">AAR-2</a>
          in our example, and stick with that. It is a bit of a
          faff but not too much work. (For more information on the
          individual signaling systems distributed with JMRI, see
          <a href="../../../../../xml/signals/">this page</a>; for
          more info on how this works, see the page on <a href=
          "AspectSignaling.shtml">aspect signaling</a>)
        </li>

        <li>Go back to the front screen of PanelPro and from the
        Panel &gt; New... menu create a new panel with <a href=
        "#editor">Layout Editor</a> and draw your track plan.</li>

        <li>Right click on the Turnouts and anchor points on the
        panel where you want signals and choose 'Set SignalMasts'.
        You can then choose from the list of Signal Masts that you
        entered in the Signal Mast Table for each possible
        location. Not all anchorpoints or turnouts will have a full
        complement of signals.<br>
        You will probably have some locations (e.g. in a hidden
        section) where you do not have a physical signal but in the
        real prototype there would be one - in these cases just add
        a Virtual signal of the appropriate type by using a Virtual
        connection type in the <a href="SignalMasts.shtml">Signal
        Mast Table</a>.</li>

        <li>Right click on each signal and click 'Signal Mast Logic
        &gt; Discover'. JMRI will then magically create all the
        required logic to set the aspect of that signal, based on
        the turnouts and aspects of the next signals on all
        possible routes.</li>

        <li>Add your sensors to the Sensor Table to any Blocks that
        have physical block detector feedback on the layout and
        assign each Sensor to its layout Block. Skip this bit if
        you are not using block detection and just setting the
        signals manually to hold behind the train.</li>

        <li>Run the trains and watch the signals change following
        your chosen rules. Note that there has been no need to
        refer to the rulebook and no need to create Logix or
        anything like that. It is just a case of inputting your
        layout configuration, Signaling System (AAR-2 in our
        example) and hardware.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Notes</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>The nitty-gritty of using the <a name="editor" href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml"
        id="editor">Layout Editor</a> is not explained here, but
        you will soon get the hang of it and that is the hardest
        bit. It takes less time to create a working layout panel
        for the average layout than it took to type this up so that
        shows how easy it is to start with Signaling with
        JMRI.</li>

        <li>You might start with software signals on a panel only,
        gradually adding signal decoders and model signals on the
        layout. When you have decided on the hardware solution and
        signal System to adopt, you can build the full definitions
        from the start. Otherwise use the Virtual signal type and
        replace them with a new Signal Masts later.</li>

        <li>Watch out when disabling Aspects. Not all Signaling
        Systems are able to deal with key Aspects being disabled
        because it is not always possible to include an alternative
        in the aspect mapping for some masts (e.g. when the
        alternative aspect has the same speed and divergence
        settings). Don't be surprised if when disabling an aspect
        the alternative that is displayed is "Stop". So, disabling
        should be done with care. If you want to disable aspects it
        is usually best to configure the Layout Editor so that the
        offending aspects will not appear because the track
        conditions will not allow it by using speeds on blocks and
        so on.</li>

        <li>If you prefer the flexibility of the Control Panel
        Editor for duplicating specific prototype panels you can
        still use Aspect Signaling and its Signal Mast Logic. You
        will just need to add some items manually.</li>

      <h2>Magic SignalMan Set Up</h2>

      <p>Thanks to Jim Duncan.</p>

      <p>With Dick Bronson's new <a href=
      "http://www.rr-cirkits.com">SignalMan hardware</a> all you
      need to do is:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Choose the signal system (searchlight, color light,
        PRR, B&amp;O, etc.).</li>

        <li>Create a new Signal Mast by clicking the "Add" button
        at the bottom of the Signal Mast Table.<br>
        Do NOT try to define individual Signal Heads. You do this
        when you assign which ports are lit as you setup the
        programming on the boards in the field!</li>

        <li>Define what aspects the mast is allowed to
        display.</li>

        <li>Set up the signal connections:

          <ul>
            <li>Choose the Block the signal protects</li>

            <li>Select the next signal down the line:

              <ul>
                <li>If there is one route only:

                  <ul>
                    <li>Select the next Signal down the line that
                    each signal protects</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>If there is more than one route past signal:

                  <ul>
                    <li>Select the Turnout and Thrown/Closed
                    state</li>

                    <li>Select block protected for given route</li>

                    <li>Select signal protected on this route</li>

                    <li>Repeat for all possible routes past this
                    signal</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Program your board to respond to the signal number sent
        on the control line:

          <ul>
            <li>Define the ports lit for each Signal Aspect:

              <ul>
                <li>Select Signal Aspect to display from pull down
                list in the decoder file</li>

                <li>Select Port (head and lamp, e.g. H1R, H2G,
                etc.)</li>

                <li>Repeat for all aspects that the Signal is
                allowed to display</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Load the programming to the SignalMan board.</li>

        <li>Connect your hardware signals.</li>

        <li>Open the <b>Tools &gt; Tables &gt; SignalMasts</b>
        menu, go through each Signal Aspect and observe signal
        behavior to check your programming and connections<br>
        Hint: It's easier to reprogram the board than it is to
        change the wiring connections!</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Notes</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>That's about as basic as it gets! This will work for
        all of the Panel Editor types.</li>

        <li>Do NOT try to use the auto-block feature with a panel
        created in Panel Editor. It'll just sit there and make you
        wait forever and not do anything so it's actually easier to
        do all the route logic yourself!</li>
