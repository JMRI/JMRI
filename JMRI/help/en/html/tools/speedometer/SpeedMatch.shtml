      <h2>Speed Matching</h2>

      <h3>Consisting Engines of Different Manufacturers Using
      DCC/DecoderPro</h3>(Provided by Keith Keith Albright of the
      Four County Society of Model Engineers)

      <p>In most cases, DCC has made it easy to consist engines
      that could not be run together in analog mode. The following
      are tips and procedures that I use to allow engines to run
      together. I make it a habit of setting up all of my freight
      engines to run at the same speed. I do likewise with my
      passenger engines. If you use the same type of engine for
      both, you might want to make them all the same speed.</p>

      <p>What Speed? - Which engine do you select as your constant.
      Three possible choices are:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The slowest engine (top Speed)</li>

        <li>Your Favorite engine</li>

        <li>A sound equipped engine</li>
      </ol>All three can be used and each has advantages and
      disadvantages. The slowest engine has the advantage of
      guaranteeing that all other can be consisted. Specialized
      engines such as shays are usually ignored. If you are partial
      to a certain manufacturer (ex Stewart), you may want to make
      that your standard.

      <p>A word on engine motors and decoders. Engine motors can be
      divided into 2 categories; Open frame and can motors. Open
      frame motors tend to be faster and more subject to speed
      variation than Can motors. They draw more amperage than most
      can motors and are a little more difficult to get going at
      low speed steps. Although cheaper, with a little care and
      maintenance, they can give many hours of long service. They
      are commonly found on less expensive engines. Can motors tend
      to be much smoother in operation throughout their speed
      range. They have low current draw and little maintenance.
      They are found on newer and better quality engines.</p>

      <p>If you plan on consisting open frame and can motor engines
      together, I would recommend using TCS decoders for the open
      frame motors. Dither, a feature of TCS decoders, does a great
      job of overcoming the slow speed hang up of open frame
      motors. I would also select a can motored engine as your
      constant. Once you have decided on your constant engine, the
      following steps should allow you to run engines at the same
      speed.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>If the engine is new, it should be run in for an hour
        or two before setting the speed</li>

        <li>Warm up both engines and make sure their wheels are
        clean. 3-5 minutes usually suffices. This will also give
        you an idea on how close the speeds are for the 2
        engines.</li>

        <li>Make sure CV19 is set to 0 for both engines. Also, make
        sure your engine is not set for alternate speed steps. If
        you want to increase the starting voltage on your engine,
        do it before proceeding to step 4.</li>

        <li>Make sure the engine you want to match is in your
        decoder pro roster. Crank up decoder pro and use
        programming on the main. Call up the engine you wish to
        speed match from your roster.</li>

        <li>Make up a normal consist with your constant engine as
        the lead engine. Do not lash the engines together. 8-10
        inches between them is a good start.</li>

        <li>If you are using a decoder with BEMF, it should be
        turned off for consisting.</li>

        <li>Select the speed table screen for the engine called up
        in decoder pro.</li>

        <li>Select user defined speed table on the screen</li>

        <li>Set step 1 of your speed to the starting voltage from
        the top of the page. Set step 28 to 255</li>

        <li>Click on match ends on the speed table. Then write this
        to the loco.</li>

        <li>Run the locos. If you have made a good choice on your
        base engine, the following engine will probably be faster.
        Reduce the speed step 28 setting; Match ends and write to
        the engine. Some systems/decoders will allow you to do this
        on the fly, other will make you stop the engines. Repeat
        this procedure until the engines speed match. After you do
        a few you will be able to match an engine faster than you
        can read this procedure. We have found that this method
        gives us great speed control and is actually faster to do
        than using the Vmid and Vmax settings. It also eliminates
        fooling with forward and reverse trim if you decoder
        requires it.</li>

        <li>If your decoder does not support 28 speed step settings
        you will need to use the method outlined in the other
        clinic.</li>
      </ol>
