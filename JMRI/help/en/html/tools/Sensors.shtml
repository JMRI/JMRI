        <h2>What are Sensors?</h2>

        <p>A Sensor is JMRI's way of representing an input from the
        layout.</p>

        <p>JMRI uses a Sensor to represent the status of a block
        occupancy detector, or a pushbutton on the fascia, or just
        about anything else you can attach to an input on your DCC
        or C/MRI system.</p>

        <h3>Controlling a Sensor</h3>

        <p>Generally, you don't control the state of a Sensor
        object; JMRI, working with the hardware on your layout,
        does.</p>

        <p>But there are some occasions where you might like to
        locally change the state of a Sensor: To debug some logic
        that uses the Sensor as an input, etc. It can be very
        convenient to temporarily change how a Sensor is set
        without having to run out to the layout and push a button
        or put a locomotive in a block.</p>

        <p>Therefore, JMRI lets you change a Sensor via the Sensor
        Table (see below), or by clicking on a sensor icon on a
        panel (See the <a href=
        "../apps/PanelPro/PanelPro.shtml">PanelPro pages</a> for
        more on Panels).</p>

        <p>The change takes effect immediately, unless a debounce
        timer is configured (see below), but only lasts until the
        next time you change it in the program, or the next time
        the input hardware on the layout changes the value.</p>

        <h2>Sensor Properties</h2>

        <h3><a name="Debounce" id="Debounce"></a>Sensor
        Debounce</h3>

        <p>The Sensor Debounce facility is there to help prevent
        false triggers of a Sensor being passed into the system and
        triggering other events in the system.<br>
        Such false triggers could be due to a dirty piece of track
        or electrical interference.</p>

        <p>The facility allows you to assign a period in
        milliseconds before the change is registered with the rest
        of the system. If after that period the state has not
        changed then the Sensor state will be passed onto the rest
        the of the system.<br>
        However if the Sensors state is different after the timer
        has finished, then the system will restart the process,
        this time after the timer has finished it will check to see
        if the sensor state is in the same state as it was before
        it restarted the process. If not the process is re-started
        again until the state is the same before and after the
        timer is run.</p>

        <h2>How to setup Sensors</h2>

        <h3>The Sensor Table</h3>Sensors can be viewed and
        configured using the <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor
        Table</a>. It contains the following columns:

        <ul>
          <li>System Name</li>

          <li>User Name (optional)</li>

          <li>State (either Active, Inactive, Inconsistent or - at
          first - Unknown</li>

          <li>Comment (optional, double click to edit)</li>

          <li>Inverted (checkbox)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sensor Table Controls</h3>

        <p>Below the table is the <b>Add...</b> button<br>
        and a check box to <b>Show Sensor Debounce
        Information</b></p>

        <p>The <b>Defaults</b> menu allows you to set 2 system wide
        settings:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Global Debounce</li>

          <li>Initial Sensor State</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Saving Sensor to disk</h3>

        <p>Sensors are saved in your layout configuration file,
        along with Turnouts, Lights, Signal Heads, etc. To store
        this information on disk, use <b>Store Configuration...</b>
        in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Sensors Table (or
        other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store
        Panel...</b> in the <b>Panel</b> menu. <a name="add" id=
        "add"></a></p>

        <h3>Adding a new Sensor</h3>

        <p>To create a new Sensor, follow this procedure:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Click the <b>Tools</b> -&gt; <b>Tables</b> -&gt;
            <b>Sensors</b> menu to bring up the <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor
            Table</a> pane. Next, click the <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorAddEdit.shtml">
            <b>Add...</b></a> button at the bottom of the pane to
            bring up the Add/Edit Sensor window.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>From the <b>System</b> drop down list select the
            system to which the Sensor is connected. In the
            <b>Hardware Address</b> field enter the <a href=
            "../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#systeminfo">hardware
            address of the input connection</a> being
            referenced.<br>
            The format of the Hardware Address can often be made in
            the format of "board:channel" or "Cab Address:Pin"; you
            will need to confirm the specifics of each system's
            <a href=
            "../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#systeminfo">Naming
            Rules</a>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Enter a User Name for the Sensor. Any string of
            characters that is different from the User Name of
            other Sensors will be accepted, but it's wise to use a
            string that describes the intended use of the Sensor.
            You can leave this field blank if you'd like.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If you wish to add a number of Sensors at once,
            click on the <b>Add a Range</b> checkbox and then in
            the <b>Number to Add</b> field enter the number of
            Sensors that you wish to add. If you have entered a
            User Name, then this will be appended with a number to
            ensure that each User Name is unique. If a hardware
            address already exists in the Sensors range that is
            being added, then JMRI will skip that address and carry
            on.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Click the <b>OK</b> button at the bottom of the
            pane. If everything is fine, a message stating "New
            Sensor added..." will be displayed in the notes area.
            If there is trouble with anything, an error or warning
            message will be displayed in the notes area; you should
            then correct the error and click <b>OK</b> again.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Back in the main Sensor Table, you can then see the
            current status of the Sensor.</p>
          </li>
