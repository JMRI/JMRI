      <h2>What is a Transit?</h2>

      <p>A <b>Transit</b> is a group of two or more connected
      <b><a href="Sections.shtml">Sections</a></b> that
      describes a route around the layout of a Train traveling in a
      given direction. A Section may be in multiple Transits, and
      may be in a given Transit multiple times. Sections are kept
      in order--the first Section is connected to the second, the
      second is connected to the third, etc. That means a Section
      in a Transit must be connected to the Section before it (if
      there is one) and to the Section after it (if there is one).
      The order of the Sections determines the direction of travel
      in the Transit. Trains travel from Sections with lower
      sequence numbers toward Sections with higher sequence
      numbers. Normally Transits would only be defined for mainline
      track, and sometimes staging yard track.</p>

      <p>In user-specified areas of a Transit, <i>alternate</i>
      Sections may be designated. For example, to move between the
      "2nd" and "4th" Sections in a Transit, there may be multiple
      "3rd" Sections, any of which might be used to travel between
      the 2nd and 4th Sections. Alternate Sections provide for
      passing tracks and staging yards. Transits also provide for
      reverse loops. To provide for back-and-forth running, e.g.
      for trolley cars, an option is provided in Dispatcher to
      automatically reverse the direction of running through a
      Transit when the train reaches the end of its Transit, and
      have the train run in reverse to the beginning of its
      Transit.</p>

      <p>Transits support both manual and automatic operation of
      trains. When a train is running in automatic mode, Transits
      provide for <b>Actions</b> to be activated when a train
      reaches a designated Section in the Transit. An Action may be
      initiated by a number of events, for example, when the train
      enters a Section, or when the train stops. A variety of
      actions are possible, such as pausing the train for a
      user-designated number of fast clock minutes (a station
      stop), reverting to manual mode for local manual operation,
      or sounding the horn on a sound decoder.</p>

      <p>Transits and their associated <b><a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SectionTable.shtml">Sections</a></b>
      are designed to provide support for dispatching, either
      manual dispatching (by a dispatcher sitting at a panel), or
      automatic dispatching by the computer. Dispatching is the
      temporary allocation of Sections for the exclusive use of
      trains, either run by engineers with a throttle, and/or run
      automatically by the computer. Support for dispatching is
      provided by <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"><b>Dispatcher</b></a>,
      which also provides for set up and running of trains
      automatically.</p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>

      <p>Transits may be used with a Panel Editor Panel, with a
      Layout Editor Panel, with a CTC machine, or directly without
      any Panel. Transits (and Sections) build on JMRI's Blocks and Paths
      structure. So before attempting to create any Transits, you
      should have Blocks, Paths and Sections fully initialized for your
      layout. (An easy way to automatically initialize your Blocks
      and Paths is to sketch out a Layout Editor panel of your
      layout, with Blocks assigned. By assigning Blocks to all
      track segments, Turnouts, etc., the paths will be created
      automatically for you by JMRI.)</p>

      <h2>How to setup Transits</h2>

      <h3>Displaying and creating Transits</h3>

      <p>All the Transits that JMRI knows about can be viewed using
      the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit
      Table</a>. Select <b>Transits</b> in the <b>Tables</b>
      submenu of the <b>Tools</b> menu of the main JMRI program
      window.

      <h3>Transit Table Controls</h3>

      <p>Below the Transit Table there's an <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TransitAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
      button.</p>

      <h3>Creating a new Transit</h3>

      <p>To Create a new Section, click the "<a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TransitAddEdit.shtml">Add..."
      button</a> at the bottom of the Transit Table pane.

      <h3>Saving Sections to disk</h3>

      <p>Use the <b>Store</b> item in the <b>File</b> menu of the
      Transit Table (or the <b>Store Panels...</b> item in the
      <b>Panels</b> menu of the main JMRI window) to save Transit
      information to disk. This information is saved with the configuration and
      panels in an XML file, along with control panel setup and
      similar stuff. To store your panels in the same file
      (recommended), select <b>File&gt;Store&gt;Store Configuration
      and Panels To File...</b> or select <b>Panels&gt;Store
      Panels...</b> in the main JMRI window.</p>
