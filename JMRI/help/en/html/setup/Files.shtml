      <h1>JMRI Setup: Configuration Files</h1>

      <p>This section attempts to explain where JMRI Configuration
      (settings) Files are stored on your computer and what
      information they contain.</p>

      <dl>
        <dd><a name="location" id="location"></a></dd>

        <dt class="left">Configuration File Locations</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          There are two places where JMRI Configuration Files can
          be found:

          <ol>
            <li>The originally-distributed versions of JMRI
            Configuration Files live in an 'xml' directory in the
            JMRI application package and its subdirectories. 
            (The exact location depends on how you 
            installed JMRI on your computer) 
            <p>Note
            that anything you modify here will be lost when you
            update JMRI to a new version. 
            This is not the right place to make changes!
            </li>

            <li>The user's JMRI Preferences directory and its
            subdirectories is also of importance. JMRI looks here
            first for any files it needs.<br>
              You should put any locally-modified versions of files
              here so they don't get overwritten by a JMRI update.
              Any files that the program writes to containing local
              information, e.g. Roster entries and Panel files, are
              also written here.
              <P>
              The default user's Preferences location varies by
              computer operating system. Normally, it's located:

              <ul>
                <li>On a Linux machine, look for a .jmri directory
                in your home directory.</li>

                <li>On Mac OS X, Preferences are stored in a "JMRI"
                folder in the /Users/me/Library/Preferences/
                folder.</li>

                <li>On Windows, this can be in a number of places
                depending on the Windows version you're running and
                whether you have multiple users configured. Start
                by looking under "Documents" or "User Documents" or
                "Users and Documents". You're looking for a folder
                called "JMRI".</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The easiest way to find the preferences location is to start a JMRI
              program, e.g. DecoderPro or PanelPro, and select
              "Locations ..." from the "Help" menu. A special treat
              for Windows users: if you go to the Windows Start
              Menu, in the JMRI section, you can select
              "Preferences" to have it open that directory for
              you.</p>

            <li>User files can be stored under the preferences location, 
              but JMRI can also be configured to put them somewhere else.
              <p>You may set or change the location scripts and
              user files in the <a href=
              "../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#FileLocations">
              Preferences... -&gt; File Locations</a> panel. Note
              that changing the "User Files Location" will also
              change the default location for Panels, Rosters
              etc.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Types of Configuration Files</dt>

        <dd>
          Inside your JMRI Preferences folder are a number of types
          of configuration files used by DecoderPro:

          <ul>
            <li>Decoder definitions - Stored in the
            <strong>decoders</strong> subdirectory, one for any
            customized decoder; these define how a specific family
            of decoders is configured.</li>

            <li>Locomotive configurations - Stored in the
            <strong>roster</strong> subdirectory, one for each
            Locomotive; these record the specific configuration of
            each Locomotive in your Roster.</li>

            <li>Programmer definitions - Stored in the
            <strong>programmers</strong> subdirectory when you've
            used at least one Programmer; these define the formats
            for the various programming sheets that are available
            in Decoder Pro.</li>

            <li>The DecoderPro folder, containing your
            profiles.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">General Configuration Files</dt>

        <dd>
          There are many more JMRI Configuration Files, some shared
          by applications, which live in the user's Preferences
          directory:

          <ul>
            <li><tt>roster.xml</tt> - an index of your
            Locomotives</li>

            <li><tt>decoderIndex.xml</tt> - an index of the
            available decoder definition files. It also contains
            the information on which specific decoder model uses
            which file, how to identify them, and what options they
            implement.</li>

            <li><tt>names.xml</tt> - not used during normal
            operation, this is a list of the standard Variable
            Names for use in programmer definitions.</li>
          </ul>
