      <p>JMRI's web pages and help screens are written in a
      simple subset of HTML, the language that powers the web. The
      most important part of the content is the plain text that
      people will read, and the additional formatting information
      is kept very minimal. To update a JMRI web page, you edit
      these directly on GitHub web or on your computer with a plain
      text editor.</p>

      <p>Using a word processing app like MS Word or Front Page
      to edit these .shtml documents
      is not a good idea because they will probably add in their
      own proprietary formatting codes that will mess things up,
      possibly even to the point of being unusable by JMRI. Also,
      don't rename existing files, or make changes to the
      formatting information at the top or bottom.<br>
      So you may concentrate on making editorial changes to the
      text in the main body of a file, which is really what the
      readers are paying attention to anyway.</p>

      <p>To get started, you can drill down inside your computer's
      JMRI program files to the folder for the DecoderPro manual.
      On a Windows system, the location for this folder looks
      something like this --
      <code>C:\ProgramFiles\JMRI\help\en\manual</code>. In this
      folder is a file called <code>index.shtml</code>. Open that
      file with a text editor and look around. If you change
      something, you can then open the page in the JMRI help system
      and see how it looks (either keep a backup in case you want
      the original page back, or you can reinstall JMRI to restore
      it).</p>

      <p>The most simple changes are just ones to the text itself:
      To add a sentence or fix a wording, you just do that with the
      editor. To add a break between paragraphs, e.g. to add a new
      paragraph, you insert a "tag" that tells JMRI or a browser to
      insert a paragraph break.</p>

      <h2><a name="screenshots" id="screenshots">Creating Images
      from Screen Shots</a></h2>

      <h3>For Windows</h3>
      To snag a screen shot in Windows, start by setting up the window
      that holds what you want to capture. Make it take up as
      little space on your screen as you can while it still shows
      what you want. You can take a shot of the active window
      (instead of your whole desktop), by pressing the
      <code>&lt;Alt&gt;</code> key and the <code>&lt;Print
      Screen&gt;</code> key at the same time. (Note: Depending on
      your keyboard, you might need to press the
      <code>&lt;Fn&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Function-Lock&gt;</code>
      key as well.) This puts the image on your "clipboard" and you
      can paste it into an image-editing program such as Window's
      Paint or Photoshop.

      <h3>For Linux</h3>
      If your
      distro doesn't already have a default application that
      supports the use of the &lt;<code>Print Screen></code>&gt; and
      &lt;<code>Alt + Print Screen</code>&gt; keys you can install
      <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KSnapshot</a> or your favorite
      application to do your screen grabbing.

      <h3>For macOS</h3>
      After setting up your shot, hold down
      <code>&lt;Apple + Shift + 4&gt;</code> key.
      When you release them at the same time, the
      cursor becomes a plus sign, and you can drag it around the
      area you want. When you let go, you will have an image file
      on your desktop.

      <h3>Using a Third-Party Application</h3>
      <p>On macOS we nowadays often use Evernote
      <a href="https://evernote.com/intl/nl/products/skitch">Skitch</a>
      to grab and touch up screen shots. Here's an example of that style:<br>
      <img src="../images/GitHubPencil.png" width="285" height="101">
      </p>
      <p>We also love <a href=
      "http://www.irfanview.com">IrFanView</a>
      for screenshots, and it is free. With it, you can also
      include your mouse cursor in your snapshot. You can also take
      a series of shots easily, and even make a slideshow of them.
      You can tell it what file format you want the image files to
      be AND where you want them to be saved before you take the
      shot, and that makes it easier to work with them in a program
      like Paint or Photoshop.</p>

      <h2><a name="sizing" id="sizing">Sizing and Saving the
      Images</a></h2>
      Any changes you
      make to your image should be done before you use Amaya to
      insert it into your document. Remember that if you change it,
      it needs to be re-inserted. Make sure you save the image as
      one of the following filetypes: PNG, JPG, or JPEG (not BMP or
      TIF), and do not use any spaces or capital letters in the
      image file name. Generally, a good size for the width of an
      image is 500 pixels or less, at a web resolution of 72 pixels
      per inch. If you know how to resize your images, it would be
      very helpful.

      <h2><a name="submitpage" id="submitpage">Submitting
      to GitHub</a></h2>

      <p>If you understand this, you
      are ready to help us update the many JMRI documents that we
      use for both the JMRI website and for the Help files in a
      next software build.</p>

      <p>When you submit your changes to be included in future JMRI
      releases, they are given a quick check and then merged into
      the previous content. The check is done by using GitHub tools
      to find the parts of the file that have been changed.</p>

      <h3>Prepare the Files</h3>The proper filetype to use for JMRI
      has the .shtml extension. If you have made a (new) .html or
      .htm file, you should change the extension to .shtml. Don't
      use spaces or capital letters in your filenames. If you are
      not changing or adding images, just save the file with its
      original name, i.e. <span style=
      "font-family: monospace">"index.shtml"</span>, in a location
      where you can find it easily when you're ready to copy them
      to GitHub.

      <h3>Send to GitHub</h3>

      <p>You can view the current <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">JMRI repository on GitHub</a>.
      To learn how to make changes to connect to GitHub and
      contribute your changes, please read <a href=
