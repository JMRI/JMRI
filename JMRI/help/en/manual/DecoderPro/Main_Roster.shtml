      alt="Create Roster" border="0" height="483" width="391"></p>

      <p>Select a decoder that matches the one installed in your
      Locomotive. The Open Programmer button will now become
      activated and you'll be able to move on with the Programmer
      selected from the drop-down list, then click on the
      <strong>Open Programmer</strong> button, the selected
      Programmer window will open. All programmers, Basic and
      Comprehensive, open to the <a href=
      "Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">Roster Entry pane</a>.</p>

      <h3>Edit Entry...</h3>

      <h4>Edit Roster Entry Setup Pane</h4>

      alt="Edit Roster setup" border="0" height="162" width=
      "275"></p>

      <p>Select the roster entry from the drop-down list that you
      wish to edit. Select the Programmer format that you wish to
      use from the drop-down list. Click on the Open Programmer
      button and <a href="Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">Roster Entry
      Pane</a> of selected programmer will open.</p>

      <h3>Copy Entry...</h3>

      <h4 align="left">Select roster entry dialog box</h4>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Main_RosterMenu03.png"
      alt="select roster entry" border="0" height="123" width=
      "309"></p>

      <p>From the drop-down list select the roster that you wish to
      process, then click on the <strong>OK</strong> button. Click
      <strong>Cancel</strong> button if you wish to abort this
      function.</p>

      <h3>Import Entry...</h3>

      <h4 align="left">Input prompt</h4>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Main_RosterMenu04.png"
      alt="input dialog" border="0" height="127" width="299"></p>

      <p>Type the name of the new roster you wish to process then
      click on the <strong>OK</strong> button. Click
      <strong>Cancel</strong> button if you wish to abort this
      function.</p>

      <h3>Export Entry...</h3>

      <p>Opens the <a href="#SelectDialog">Select roster entry</a>
      dialog box. Next the <strong>Save</strong> dialog will be
      displayed, select the location where you would like to save
      the roster file.</p>

      <h3>Delete Entry...</h3>

      <p>Select the Locomotive that you wish to delete from
      DecoderPro in the Roster drop-down list. Click
      <strong>OK</strong> and the Confirmation box <strong>Delete
      entry <em>[file Name]</em>?</strong> is displayed. Clicking
      <strong>Yes</strong> deletes the file, <strong>No</strong>
      aborts the operation.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Main_RosterMenu05.png"

      <h3>Print Summary...</h3>

      <p>Opens your operating systems Print... dialog and when
      <strong>Print</strong> is selected, prints a complete summary
      of your roster entries. (typically 5 entries per page, so be
      prepared to print several pages). Printing to PDF file can
      save a lot of paper.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style=
      "width: 722px; height: 649px;" alt="summary" src=
      "images/Main_RosterMenu07.png"></p>

      <h3>Print Preview Summary...</h3>

      <p style="text-align: center;">Preview Roster
      Summary<img style="width: 669px; height: 605px;" alt=
      "Summary Preview" src="images/Main_RosterMenu07a.png"></p>

      <h3><a href="Main_RosterGroup.shtml">Roster Groups</a></h3>

      <p>Roster Grouping allows you to allocate Roster Entries into
      different groups. If for example you run multiple layouts
      with different locomotives, you can allocate those
      Locomotives to the relative group, thus when you select a
      roster group to work with, the drop down lists in the
      Throttle or Edit Roster entries will only contain Locomotives
      that are in that specific list.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When working with a Roster
      Group, some of the functions above change slightly:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Create Roster Group</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Delete Roster Group</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Table Association</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Add Roster Entry to Group</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Remove Roster Entry from Group</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Export Complete Roster...</h3>

      <p>Opens the Save dialog box to allow you to select directory
      and name the file.</p><a name="speedProfiling" id=
      "speedProfiling"></a>

      <h3>Speed Profiling</h3>

      <p>The Speed Profiling tool is designed to create a profile
      of a loco at various speed steps to help with the automatic
      running of a loco within JMRI. Primary goal is to help with the
      principle of getting a loco to stop within a specific distance
      from a known throttle setting.</p>

      <p>The tool works on the principle of timing a loco over a
      known distance at a given speed step, in both the forward and
      reverse direction. Currently it requires three sensors which
      monitor the occupancy of a section of track. Ideally the
      section of track that the timed runs are performed over
      should be straight, and a minimum of 1 m long, the longer the
      length the better the result. For this profiling to work
      correctly acceleration / deceleration should be disabled on
      the loco decoder.</p>

      <table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0"
      cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 408px; height: 465px;" alt=
            "speed profile" src=
            "images/Main_Roster_SpeedProfile.png"></td>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <ul>
                <li><b>Block Length</b> - This is the length in
                Millimeters of the middle section which the timed
                run will be measured.</li>

                <li><b>Start Sensor</b> - This is the Sensor on the
                initial section of track that the Locomotive will
                start its initial run from.</li>

                <li><b>Block Sensor</b> - This is the Sensor
                related to the section of track that the timed run
                will be taken over.</li>

                <li><b>Finish Sensor</b> - This Sensor is related
                to the section track immediately after the timed
                section.</li>

                <li><b>Roster Entry</b> - Select the Locomotive
                that the profiling is to be performed on.</li>

                <li><b>Cancel</b> - Cancels the profiling or test
                run.</li>

                <li><b>Profile</b> - Starts the profiling.</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>To profile the loco, fill the above details into the
      window, place the loco in the starting section facing
      forwards towards (but not on) the section of track that the
      timed run will be taken over, then press profile.</p>

      <p>What happens is that the tool will set the loco off
      running in the forward direction at speed step 1, when it
      activates the timed section sensor it starts a timer. Once
      the finish section sensor is activated the timer is stopped,
      and the speed is calculated in Millimeters per Second, this
      is then recorded against the roster. The tool will then
      ensure that the loco is clear of the timed section sensor,
      then repeat the procedure again but in the reverse direction.
      Once the loco is back at the initial start section, the whole
      procedure is repeated again for the next speed step, this
      occurs until a profile of all speed steps has been
      completed.</p>

      <h4>Testing</h4>

      <p>Having completed the profiling, it is possible to test the
      profile out. Place the loco in the starting section again
      facing forward toward the timed section, ideally some
      distance away from it. Enter in a starting speed step number
      in the box next to the Test Button, then press test. What
      will occur is that the tool will set the loco off running at
      the given speed step, then it will attempt to gradually stop
      the loco before it reaches the far end. Results will vary
      especially at the higher speed steps, where you will more
      likely experience an over run.</p>
