      <p align="left">Three types of consists are used on DCC
      systems:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A <strong><em>basic</em></strong> or
        <strong><em>primary address consist</em></strong>, where
        each locomotive is assigned the same address on the
        programming track, or on the main with <a href=
        "Basic_Programming.shtml#OpsMode">OpsMode Programming</a>
        (if supported by the command station and decoder).<br>
        <br></li>

        <li>A <strong><em>Command Station Assisted
        Consist</em></strong> (CSAC) which builds the consist using
        a function of your command station. Command Station
        Assisted Consists go by the trade names listed below.<br>
          <br>

          <table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding=
          "1" cellspacing="1">
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Manufacturer</strong></td>

              <td><strong>Trade Name</strong></td>

              <td><strong>Usage Notes</strong></td>

              <td>Limited to the number of slots supported by the
              system. Allows any address</td>
            </tr>

              <td>Old Style Consist</td>

              <td>Standard Consist</td>

              <td>Limited to 8 locomotives. Allows any address but
              00 to be used</td>
            </tr>
          </table><br>
        </li>

        <li>A <em><strong>Decoder Assisted Consist
        (</strong></em>DAC), often referred to as Advanced Consist.
        The NMRA<sup>&reg;</sup> has set aside CV19 as a dedicated
        location for consist addresses. If CV19 contains a value
        other than 0, the locomotive will respond to speed and
        direction instructions sent to the address in CV19. If CV19
        contains zero then it will respond to speed and direction
        commands sent to the usual short or long decoder address.
        Since the consist address is a single CV, it is limited to
        the range of 1 to 127. If you add 128 to the consist
        address, the locomotive will run backwards (relative to
        it's normal direction of travel) in the consist. The DAC
        can be set up in the <a href=
        "Comp_Consist.shtml"><strong>Consisting</strong></a> tab in
        the Comprehensive Programmer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>DecoderPro Consisting Tool</h4>

      <p>The consist tool provides a visual tool for manipulating
      the <em><strong>Decoder Assisted Consists</strong></em> and ,
      on some command stations, <em><strong>Command Station
      Assisted Consists.</strong></em></p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Main_consist_01.png"
      width="616" height="331" alt="consist"></p>

      <p>The <input name="radio" type="radio" id="radio" value=
      "radio" checked> <strong>Advanced Consist</strong> and the
      <input type="radio" name="radio2" id="radio2" value="radio2">
      <strong>Command Station Consist</strong> allow you to select
      either consisting mode if supported by your command station.
      If not supported the options will be grayed out.</p>

      <p><strong>Consist</strong> text box: type the consist ID
      assigned to the locomotives in the consist for
      <em><strong>Decoder Assisted Consists.</strong></em> For
      Command Station Consist, this is automatically filled in with
      the address of the lead locomotive in the consist.</p>

      <p><strong>New Locomotive</strong> text box : type in a new
      locomotive address or select from you roster using the
      drop-down list.</p>

      <p>Clicking the <strong><input type="button" name="button"
      id="button" value="adds"></strong> will add the locomotive to
      the consist and it will appear in the list area of the
      window.</p>

      <p>Clicking the <strong><input type="button" name="button2"
      id="button2" value="Button"></strong> will clear the
      information of the current locomotive.</p>

      <p>The <input name="checkbox" type="checkbox" id="checkbox"
      checked> <strong>Direction Normal ?</strong> determines the
      direction of the locomotive travel as forwarded or reverse
      when the consist is traveling forward. Will be grayed out
      until the lead locomotive is selected.</p>

      <p><strong><input type="button" name="button3" id="button3"
      value="DEL"></strong> removes the consist. The list of the
      consist will have a <input type="button" name="button4" id=
      "button4" value="DEL"> for each locomotive, allowing you to
      remove any locomotive from the consist.</p>

      <p><input type="button" name="button6" id="button6" value=
      "Delelte"> deletes the entire consist.</p>

      <p><a href="Main_Throttle.shtml"><input type="button" name=
      "button5" id="button5" value="Throttle"></a> opens a
      <strong><a href="Main_Throttle.shtml">throttle</a></strong>
      for the consist.</p>

      <p><input type="button" name="button7" id="button7" value=
      "Reverse"> reverses the direction of the consist.</p>
