This is the help/en/images directory.

Eventually, we want to move _all_ the top level help images
here, where they will form a common pool and reduce
duplication.

Usage:
popup.gif is used in help/en/JHelpDev
paneleditor.gif is used in help/en/package/apps/PanelPro/PanelPro.shtml and Panels.shtml
SE8cExampleLogic.png is used in help/en/html/signaling/SimpleSignalExample and jmrit/blockboss/BlockBossLogic
