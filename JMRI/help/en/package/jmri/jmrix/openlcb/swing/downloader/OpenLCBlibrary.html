  <title>Freeze/Unfreeze in the OpenLCB protocols</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="white">
  The OpenLCB Memory Configuration protocol specification adopted
  as of January 2015 contained a feature that JMRI uses to provide
  a safe and reliable firmware downloader for OpenLCB nodes. The
  original documentation, since removed, was:

  <blockquote>
    4.4.7 Lock/Reserve and Freeze/Unfreeze

    <p>An OpenLCB node can, in general, be configured while the
    network and even the node itself is operating.</p>

    <p>Configuration of a node can be simplified by disabling its
    operation while it's being updated, so that there's no concern
    about it trying to react to transient incomplete information.
    For example, inconsistent configuration memory contents while
    one section has been rewritten and another section not
    rewritten might drive output to undesired states or cause
    inputs to generate spurious messages. The Freeze/Unfreeze
    command, if supported, can be used to tell a node that it
    should &amp;quote;freeze&amp;quote; operation, ignoring inputs
    and outputs, while the configuration is being updated. A reset
    of the node releases the freeze option, if set, so the
    configuring node can just reset the node being configured at
    the end of the operation. Note that this is not a required
    protocol: The node being configured is free to ignore the
    freeze and unfreeze operations. In that case, it should send a
    negative response to them to tell the configuring node that
    they are not needed. Note that it's also possible to do a
    similar thing using code in the node being configured and the
    required Update Complete command.</p>

    <p>Although nodes can be configured by multiple other nodes at
    the same time, this can also lead to inconsistencies. The
    optional Lock/Release command can be used to avoid this. At the
    start of configuration, a configuring node sends a Lock message
    with its NodeID. If no node has locked this node, indicated by
    zero content in the lock memory, the incoming NodeID is placed
    in the lock memory. If a node has locked this node, the
    non-zero NodeID in the lock memory is not changed. In either
    case, the content of the lock memory is returned in the reply.
    This acts as an atomic test&amp;set operation, and informs the
    requesting node whether it successfully reserved the node. To
    release the node, repeat the lock operation with a zero NodeID.
    The lock memory is set to zero when the node is reset. Note
    that this is a voluntary protocol in the configuring nodes
    only; the node being configured does not change its response to
    configuration operations when locked or unlocked.</p>

    <p>4.4.7.1 Reloading node programming</p>

    <p>The Memory Configuration Protocol can be used to load new
    programing into a node. That can be done in many ways,
    depending on the desires of the node developer:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Writing to specific memory space(s) could directly change
      the node's programming. This could be the entire program, or
      just parts of it that are distinguished by use of different
      memory spaces. OpenLCB memory address spaces are large, so
      one could also use upper bits to distinguish different parts
      of the program. Combined with freeze/unfreeze, this can be
      used to create ways to update a running system, e.g. loading
      new options into a node during operations so you can see
      their effect in real time.</li>

      <li>Low-end notes might have monolithic firmware and limited
      memory capacity. Those are traditionally given firmware
      updates by having the processor retreat to a "firmware
      downloader", sometimes colloquially but incorrectly called a
      "bootloader". This can be done via OpenLCB with:

        <ol type="A">
          <li>Optionally, Lock must succeed</li>

          <li>Freeze to the memory space containing the program,
          which clues the node to retreat to its downloader</li>

          <li>A sequence of memory write operations via datagram or
          stream until complete</li>

          <li>Unfreeze</li>

          <li>Update Complete</li>

          <li>Optionally, Unlock</li>

          <li>Reboot/reset</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If the node needs time to write the downloaded code to
        memory, the write operations provide well-defined ways to
        delay the response. The downloading node just needs to
        ensure that one operation is complete before moving on to
        the next.</p>

        <p>If something goes wrong in the download and write
        process, the node should send a negative reply to the write
        operation, which the downloading node can then use as an
        indication that the operation has failed. That can cause a
        retry from the 1st address, or a request for user
        intervention, depending on whether it's a permanent or
        temporary error.</p>

        <p>The target node needs to maintain a small amount of
        state as it retreats to its downloader code: The NodeID
        (and CAN alias if on CAN) so it can be found, the fact that
        it's in Initialized state and in Frozen (Freezed?) state,
        and the Lock NodeID if that's supported.</p>

        <p>A node can reset itself at any time, and the process for
        this is well defined. So if a very simple download routine
        can't go straight back into operation after downloading, it
        can reset the node without waiting for the Reboot/reset
        command.</p>

        <p>A node manufacturer can implement a very simple (and not
        very strong) form of download security against download of
        invalid contents by compiling in some locations at known
        low memory locations (so they&amp;quote;re written in the
        1st write transfer) that have known values. If
        they&amp;quote;re not there, the downloader code rejects
        the write with a permanent error and the download will
        stop.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&amp;quote;Freeze&amp;quote; is a more general case of
  &amp;quote;enter bootloader&amp;quote;.</p>

  <p>If the only thing that a node can do is &amp;quote;jump to the
  bootloader, and accept data for reprogramming&amp;quote;, the
  &amp;quote;Freeze&amp;quote; and &amp;quote;Enter
  Bootloader&amp;quote; are the same. Just reboot/restart when
  done.</p>

  <p>If a node can allow configuration memory to be rewritten on
  the fly, even while doing what it normally does, then neither
  &amp;quote;Freeze&amp;quote; nor &amp;quote;Enter
  Bootloader&amp;quote; nor anything else is needed: Just write the
  memory.</p>

  <p>Some applications can allow updates of parts of their memory
  without requiring restart. They just need to be
  &amp;quote;frozen&amp;quote;/&amp;quote;drained&amp;quote;/&amp;quote;quiesced&amp;quote;
  while the update happens. Technically, you&amp;quote;re saying
  &amp;quote;keep the PC out of this part of the code for a bit,
  and later I&amp;quote;ll tell you to go again; I promise that
  your live data will be OK&amp;quote;. There&amp;quote;s even a
  model railroad manufacturer who uses this facility for writing
  sound information into their products, so that you can mess with
  the sounds in a semi-realtime way without causing the sound
  processing to crash.</p>

  <p>For something as straight-forward as a PIC or Arduino-based
  node, just map the &amp;quote;Freeze&amp;quote; command to
  &amp;quote;reply to the datagram and then jump to the
  bootloader&amp;quote;, and the &amp;quote;unfreeze&amp;quote; to
  &amp;quote;reply and then do a reset&amp;quote; (or, if need be,
  just reset)</p>

  <p>Note that Freeze is optional; a negative reply to it
  doesn&amp;quote;t stop the download process. (All datagrams must
  get a reply of some sort)</p>

  <p>The JMRI bootloader will continue after a negative reply to
  Freeze, or a timeout at that point. That timeout is the default
  one, 700 msec, which is long enough to be visible to a person
  watching. But compared to a 20-30 second download time, perhaps
  that&amp;quote;s not an issue.</p>
