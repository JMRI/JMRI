      <h2>Monitor Maple Traffic</h2>

      <p>This window allows you to monitor communication between your
      Maple panels and your computer, so you can see what is happening
      as JMRI sends information to and receives information from your
      Maple System. You can save this information to a log file for
      troubleshooting purposes.</p>

      <p><b>Background Information:</b> On Maple, the coil bits in the
      Maple HMI's are used to communicate with JMRI. In this
      Maple-to-JMRI implementation, all panels use the same address
      space and have exactly the same input and output bit assignments.
      The first 1000 coil bits are reserved for configuration as
      Sensors. Sensors are referred to as "Input Bits" and are used to
      set JMRI Sensors according to status bits in your Maple HMI
      panels. Therefore, Sensors pass information from configured HMI
      panels to JMRI. The next 8000 bits are reserved for assignment as
      "Output Bits" and are used to send the current settings of
      Turnouts and Lights to the Maple Panels.</p>Maple communications
      work by polling. Each panel is polled separately, and the results
      of the polls are ORed together to set Sensors. Therefore if a
      Sensor is ACTIVE (Maple "1") in any panel, it is set ACTIVE. If a
      Sensor is INACTIVE (Maple "0") in all configured panels, then it
      is set INACTIVE. The panels are polled in the order that they are
      configured. <b>Note:</b> The Maple poll command only allows a
      maximum of 99 bits to be read with each poll command, so if more
      than 99 input bits are configured, you will see multiple poll
      commands for each panel.

      <p>After all panels have been polled, the status of output bits
      is sent to the panels. Output bits are sent in "Broadcast Mode"
      so all panels can receive the bits at the same time. Broadcast
      Mode is indicated by an HMI Station Address of "0". Output bits
      begin with HMI coil bit address of "1001". All configured output
      bits are sent, regardless of if the bit is assigned or not.
      <b>Note:</b> The Maple write command only allows a maximum of 99
      bits to be written with each transmit command, so if more than 99
      output bits are configured, you will see multiple transmit
      commands, with starting addresses increasing by 99 in each.</p>
