      This window lets you monitor and control the speed of sound
      used by the <a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/index.shtml">RPS
      system</a>.

      <p>RPS measures times, and uses a value for the speed of
      sound to calculate the corresponding distances that it uses
      to calculate positions. It's important that the speed of
      sound be very precise. If you want to measure an eight-foot
      distance to within 1/4 of an inch, you need to measure the
      speed of sound to about one part in a thousand, getting three
      significant digits right in the value. Since the speed of
      sound changes slightly with temperature, pressure and
      humidity, measuring it automatically is very useful.</p>

      <p>This window displays the current speed value on the top
      line. Depending on how the system is operating, this might
      change occasionally.</p>

      <p>Below that are two sections for controlling the speed.</p>

      <p>In the middle section, you can directly enter a new value.
      Click "Set" to have it take effect immediately.</p>

      <p>The RPS can also calculate the speed of sound from a
      measurement. To do this, you neeed to have a fixed RPS
      transmitter that's a known distance from a receiver. Enter
      the known distance, the ID number of the transmitter, and the
      number of the receiver to which you've measured the
      distance.</p>

      <p>When the RPS system takes a reading from that transmitter,
      it will use the known distance and measured time to calculate
      a measured speed of sound. That value is displayed in the
      bottom line.</p>

      <p>If you check the "Auto Set" box, RPS will slowly update
      the speed value it's using every time a reading is obtained.
      The "Damping" box determines how much averaging is being
      done: Larger values use a larger number of samples when
      averaging the update. The default value of 10 is a good
      compromise between keeping the value stable, and responding
      to changes.</p>

      <p>Currently, the automatic update only works while this
      window is open. Once we have more experience with this tool,
      we'll probably make this feature operate automatically,
      without needing the window.</p>
