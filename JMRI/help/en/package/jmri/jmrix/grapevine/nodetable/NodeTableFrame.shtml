      <h1>Grapevine Node Table</h1>

      <p>The "Node Table" tool lets you see all your Grapevine nodes at
      once. Each line in the table corresponds to one node address.<br>
      The columns are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Address</dt>

        <dd>The node number</dd>

        <dt>Status</dt>

        <dd>
          The current status of this node.

          <dl>
            <dt>Configured</dt>

            <dd>This node has been configured in JMRI. You can talk
            to its Turnouts, SignalHeads, Sensors, etc.</dd>

            <dt>Present</dt>

            <dd>This node has been detected on the Grapevine, but
            it you need to configure it before you can access it in
            the program.</dd>

            <dt>Absent</dt>

            <dd>The node is not configured, and has not been seen
            on the Grapevine.</dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>

        <dt>Add/Edit Node</dt>

        <dd>The third column provides a button for you to add a
        missing node or edit the configuration of an existing node.
        If you do add or edit a node, remember to save your
        JMRI Preferences again!</dd>

        <dt>Initialize</dt>

        <dd>If the node is configured, there's a button in the 4th
        column that lets you send the initialization messages to
        the node. This is useful if e.g. the node has been turned
        off and on, so needs to be reinitialized. This is only
        available for configured nodes.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Below the table is a "Check" button and a status field.
      <br>
      Click "Check" to scan the Grapevine to check its status and
      locate nodes. The status field displays:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Starting</dt>

        <dd>A scan is starting, but no reply has been heard from
        the Grapevine yet.</dd>

        <dt>Checking node x</dt>

        <dd>Scan in progress, and the Grapevine seems to be
        working. Wait for the chack to complete with node 127.</dd>

        <dt>OK</dt>

        <dd>Scan completed OK.</dd>

        <dt>Grapevine failed</dt>

        <dd>Scan completed without hearing anything from the
        Grapevine. Perhaps the cable isn't completely connected, or
        some piece isn't powered up.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Click the "Change Node Board Address..." button to change
      the address of a Grapevine node. It opens the
      <a href="RenumberFrame.shtml">Change Grapevine Board Address</a> pane.</p>
