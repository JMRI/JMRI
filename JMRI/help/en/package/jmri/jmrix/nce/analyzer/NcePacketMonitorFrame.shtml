            <p>The NCE DCC Packet Analyzer tool works with the
            <a href=
            "https://ncedcc.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200979515-Packet-Analyzer"
            target="_blank">NCE Packet Analyzer</a> product to read
            and present the DCC packets on your track. It connects
            via a separate serial port from your command station
            connection.</p>

            <p>If you do not have an NCE system, configure a new
            second connection in <a href=
            "/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/Start_Preferences.shtml#Connections"
            target="_blank">Preferences-&gt;Connections</a> to "NCE
            Simulator" so you can access the NCE "DCC Packet
            Analyzer" menu item. If you do this, you will need to
            restart JMRI and then open <a href=
            "/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/Start_Preferences.shtml#Defaults"
            target="_blank">Preferences-&gt;Defaults</a> to check
            that the NCE Simulator has not "stolen" any of your
            real connections.</p>

      <h2>Using the Analyzer</h2>Select the "Serial port:" and push
      the "Open" button before using any of the radio buttons. The
      baud rate is fixed at 38.4Kbps. If nothing appears on the
      screen immediately, select a new display mode (e.g.
      "Verbose") and some packet types to display (e.g. "Idle
      Packets").

      <p>Use the radio buttons to configure the analyzer to your
      liking. Note that the NCE analyzer will remember the
      configuration when it is powered down.</p>

      <p>The "+ on" checkbox allows you to suppress identical
      packets. Each time the JMRI program detects a packet that it
      identical to the previous it will replace the packet with a
      "+" character. Warning, the JMRI program will only display
      the suppressed packets ("+" characters) after receiving a
      packet that isn't identical to the previous. If there's
      little activity it is recommended that you not use the
      suppress feature. This way you will immediately see all
      packets being captured by the analyzer.</p>

      <p>The "Info" button will cause the analyzer to display its
      inbuilt help screen and the Analyzer version number. Press
      the "Res." button to resume normal operation.</p>

      <h2>Hex mode displays:</h2><b>H0 mode (compatible with the
      ICC analyzer):</b><br>
      Displays packets in hex mode preceded by one character
      indicating how many start bits in the packet preamble. There
      are no spaces between any characters or bytes.<br>
      Example: $03686B<br>
      Description: 14 start bits with three byte packet following
      with bytes of 0x03, 0x68, 0x6B

      <p><b>H1 mode:</b><br>
      Same as H0 mode except spaces will delimit preamble char and
      each pair of hex characters.<br>
      Example: $ 03 68 6B<br>
      14 start bits with three byte packet following with bytes of
      0x03, 0x68, 0x6B</p>

      <p><b>H2 mode:</b><br>
      Displays packets in hex mode with no indication of how many
      preamble bits. There are no spaces between any characters or
      bytes.<br>
      Example: 03686B<br>
      Three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68,
      0x6B</p>

      <p><b>H3 mode:</b><br>
      Same as H2 mode except spaces will delimit each pair of hex
      characters<br>
      Example: 03 68 6B<br>
      Three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68,
      0x6B</p>

      <p><b>H4 mode:</b><br>
      Displays packets in hex mode preceded by Pxx where xx
      indicates how many preamble bits (in hex). There are no
      spaces between any characters or bytes.<br>
      Example: P0E03686B<br>
      14 start bits with three byte packet following with bytes of
      0x03, 0x68, 0x6B</p>

      <p><b>H5 mode:</b><br>
      Same as H4 mode except spaces will delimit preamble chars and
      each pair of hex characters<br>
      Example: P0E 03 68 6B<br>
      14 start bits with three byte packet following with bytes of
      0x03, 0x68, 0x6B</p>

      Displays packets in hex mode with no indication of how many
      preamble bits but preceded by the letter P. There are no
      spaces between any characters or bytes.<br>
      Example: P03686B<br>
      Three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68,
      0x6B</p>

      Three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68, 0x6B 
      </p>

      <h2>Verbose mode displays:</h2>Verbose mode displays are
      intended to allow humans to interpret packet contents. The
      display is cryptic but understandable. Unless stated
      otherwise all numbers are displayed in decimal. Any packet
      that isn't understood by the analyzer will be displayed in
      hex.

      <p>Reset packets will be displayed as: "RESET"</p>

      <p>Idle packets are displayed as: "IDLE"</p>
