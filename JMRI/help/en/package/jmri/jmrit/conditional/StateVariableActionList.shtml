          <h2><a name="variable" id="variable">Available State
          Variables</a></h2>

          <p>State variables that are currently available for use
          in Conditionals are listed below, along with information
          on each. State variables must always evaluate to either
          true or false. The condition resulting in true is given
          for each. If the condition is not met, the state variable
          evaluates to false. When a Logix is active, the states of
          entities (sensor, turnout, light, etc.) specified in
          state variables in its Conditionals are monitored, unless
          the Triggers Calculation checkbox of the state variable
          is unchecked. A calculation of all Conditionals in the
          Logix is triggered when any monitored state changes as
          noted below (if not obvious).</p>

          <ul>

            <li>Sensor<ul>
              <li><strong>Sensor Active</strong>: Evaluates to true if the
              state of the specified sensor is active.</li>

              <li><strong>Sensor Inactive</strong>: Evaluates to true if the
              state of the specified sensor is inactive.</li>

            </ul></li>
            <li>Turnout<ul>
              <li><strong>Turnout Thrown</strong>: Evaluates to true if the
              known state of the specified turnout is thrown.</li>

              <li><strong>Turnout Closed</strong>: Evaluates to true if the
              known state of the specified turnout is closed.</li>

            </ul></li>
            <li>Light<ul>
              <li><strong>Light On</strong>: Evaluates to true if the specified
              light is on.</li>

              <li><strong>Light Off</strong>: Evaluates to true if the
              specified light is off.</li>

            </ul></li>
            <li>Signal Head<ul>
              <li><strong>Signal Head Appearance equals</strong>: Evaluates to
              true if the appearance of the specified signal head matches
              the selected Variable Aspect (appearance).</li>

              <li><strong>Signal Head Lit</strong>: Evaluates to true if the
              specified signal head is lit.</li>

              <li><strong>Signal Head Held</strong>: Evaluates to true if the
              specified signal head is being held.</li>

            </ul></li>
            <li>Signal Mast<ul>
              <li><strong>Signal Mast Aspect Equals</strong>: Evaluates to true if
              the aspect of the specified signal mast equals the aspect
              specified in the state variable. Calculation is triggered
              when the aspect of the signal mast changes.</li>

              <li><strong>Signal Mast Lit</strong>: Evaluates to true if the
              specified signal mast is Lit.</li>

              <li><strong>Signal Mast Held</strong>: Evaluates to true if the
              specified signal mast is being held.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Memory<ul>
              <li>
              <strong>Memory-Value Compare</strong>: Compares the value saved in
              the specified memory to the value specified in the state
              variable using a specified comparison operator. Evaluates
              to true if the comparison is true. There are 5 comparison
              operators that may be used for the evaluation:
              <ul>
                <li>"less than"</li>
                <li>"less than or equal"</li>
                <li>"equals"</li>
                <li>"greater than or equal"</li>
                <li>"greater than"</li>
              </ul>
              Calculation is triggered when the monitored memory
              value changes so that the comparison to the specified
              value changes.
              </li>

              <li>
              <strong>Memory-Memory Compare</strong>: Compares the value saved in
              one specified memory to the value saved in a second
              memory location. There are 5 comparison operators that
              may be used for the evaluation:
              <ul>
                <li>"less than"</li>
                <li>"less than or equal"</li>
                <li>"equals"</li>
                <li>"greater than or equal"</li>
                <li>"greater than"</li>
              </ul>
              Calculation is triggered when one of the monitored
              memory values changes so that the comparison value
              changes.
              </li>
            </ul></li>

          <h2><a name="action" id="action">Available Actions</a></h2>

          <p>Actions that are currently available for use in
          Conditionals are listed below along with information on
          each:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Sensor<ul>
              <li><strong>Set Sensor</strong>: Sets the specified sensor to the
              chosen state. Specify the sensor to set by entering its
              name. Specify the state to set by choosing Active or
              Inactive in the popup menu.</li>

              choosing Active or Inactive in the popup menu. Specify
              the number of seconds to delay before setting the
              sensor by entering a number in the right-most field. If
              this Conditional is already waiting to set this sensor,
              this action is ignored, and the previous action
              continues as originally scheduled.(see also <strong>Reset
              Delayed Set Sensor</strong> below.)</li>

              <li><strong>Reset Delayed Set Sensor</strong>: Sets the specified

              This action is the same as <strong>Delayed Set Sensor</strong>,
              except if this Conditional is already actively waiting
              to set the specified sensor, the previous wait is
              cancelled, and a new wait period is started. In effect,
              the wait time is restarted. The sensor is not set until
              the most recent wait period expires.</li>

              <li><strong>Cancel Timers for Sensor</strong>: Cancels all timers

              choosing Closed or Thrown in the popup menu. Specify
              the number of seconds to delay before setting the
              turnout by entering a number in the right-most field.
              If this Conditional is already waiting to set this
              turnout, this action is ignored, and the previous
              action continues as originally scheduled.(see also

              a specified number of seconds. Specify the turnout to
              set by entering its name. Specify the state to set by
              choosing Closed or Thrown in the popup menu. Specify
              the number of seconds to delay before setting the
              turnout by entering a number in the right-most field.
              This action is the same as <strong>Delayed Set Turnout</strong>,
