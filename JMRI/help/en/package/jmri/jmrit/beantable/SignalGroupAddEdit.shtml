      <h1>Adding/Editing a Signal Group</h1>

      <p>After clicking on the "Add..." button below the <a href=
      "../beantable/SignalGroupTable.shtml">Signal Group Table</a>,
      the following pane appears:</p><a href=
      "images/SignalGroupAdd.png"><img src="images/SignalGroupAdd.png"
      width="310" height="269"></a>

      <h3>Enter Signal Group elements</h3>

      <p>Signal Groups are built from one or more Signal Heads and
      comprise the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A parent Signal Mast (by System Name) to which this
        Signal Group is attached.</li>

        <li>A list of Aspects that cause the Signal Group to become
        active eg. the parent Signal Mast must be set for Proceed
        or Caution, but not Danger.</li>

        <li>A list of Signal Heads that make up each indication of
        the Signal Group.<br>
        Signal Heads included in a Signal Group are picked from the
        Signal Head Table, but only Signal Heads that were created
        using the <em>Single Output</em> connection type (pictured
        to the right) show up in the list.
        <a href=
        "images/SingleSignalHead.png"><img src="images/SingleSignalHead.png"
        height="185" width="127" align="right"></a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the Add/Edit Signal Group window, after entering a User
      Name for the new Signal Group and selecting the parent Signal
      Mast from the combo box, check <b>Include</b> behind one or
      more Mast Aspects in the table directly below.<br>
      Next select one or more Signal Heads by checking their
      <b>Include</b> check boxes in the second list.<br>
      Click the <b>Apply</b> button at the bottom of the pane or
      continue further set up.</p>

      <h3>Define Signal Group Conditions</h3>

      <p>Each Signal Head that you include in Signal Group has a set
      of criteria that have to be met before that Signal Head is
      illuminated. These criteria are made up from Turnout and/or
      Sensor states and can be changed by clicking on the
      corresponding <b>Edit</b> button in the last column of the
      Add/Edit Signal Group pane. A new pane like the one shown to
      the right will open, letting you define a specific Signal
      Head that is part of your Indicator.</p>

      <a href=
      "images/SignalGroupAddEditHead.png"><img src=
      "images/SignalGroupAddEditHead.png" height="234" width="297" align=
      "right"></a>

      <p>Choose two <i>different</i> values in the pop up menus at
      the top of the pane to define the states of the Indicator
      Signal Head. On meaning when conditions are met, and Off
      as long as that is not the case.<br>
      To complete the definition of a Signal Group Indicator Head,
      mark the appropriate <b>Include</b> check boxes for both
      Turnouts and Sensors, and specify their state in the last
      column of each list.<br>
      In between both lists there is a final logic
      <b>OR/AND</b> option to choose from.</p>

      <p>You will need to do some deep thinking to prepare for this
      last step, as this is the place where you control how your
      Indicator will behave. The signal hardware on your layout may
      rule out some options, so build it up in small steps and test
      often.</p>

      <p>Finish the Signal Group definition by clicking <b>Apply</b>
      in the Signal Head set up pane and again click <b>Apply</b> to
      close the Signal Group Add pane. Your new Group will appear in
      the Table.</p>

      Table help page</a>.</p>
