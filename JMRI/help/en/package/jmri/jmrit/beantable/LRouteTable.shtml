      <h1>The LRoute Table</h1>

      <p>An LRoute is a more generalized version of a Route
      implemented as a Logix. It is intended for use in situations
      where additional triggers or actions are desired beyond the
      capabilities of Routes. It can be used as a starting point
      for creating new Logix. The LRoute Table provides pick lists
      of Sensors, Turnouts, Lights, Signal Masts and Signal Heads
      from which output actions and trigger conditions can be
      chosen.</p>

      <p>Once you have some Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads and/or
      Lights to manage, use the <b>Add...</b> button in the lower
      left hand corner of the LRoute Table pane to create a new
      Logix Route. After you have created a Logix Route, you may
      add additional capabilities by editing it from the Logix
      Table.</p>

      <p>The Logix that implements the LRoute has its system name
      prefixed with "RTX". All Logix with this prefix are displayed
      in the LRoute Table. Please note that an "RTX" Logix that has
      had capabilities added with Logix editing may not be able to
      display these additional capabilities for LRoute editing.
      Once Logix editing is done to an LRoute, it is recommended
      that further editing be done from the Logix Table.</p>

      <h2>LRoute Table Columns</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>System Name</dt>

        <dd>The System Name cannot be changed once entered into the
        table. The <b>Add</b> button located in the lower left
        corner of the table allows you to add a new l-route to the
        table.</dd>

        <dt>User Name</dt>

        <dd>You can directly enter or change the "User Name" for an
        existing logix route.</dd>

        <dt>Enabled</dt>

        <dd>To disable a l-route from triggering, uncheck the
        "Enabled" box for the route. This sets its Logix to a
        disabled state. The l-route can be enabled or disabled from
        either the LRoute Table or the Logix Table.</dd>

        <dt>Edit</dt>

        <dd>Push this button to edit the LRoute. For more
        information see <a href=
        "LRouteAddEdit.shtml">Adding/Editing LRoutes</a>.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>LRoute Table Controls</h3>There is a button at the bottom
      of the LRoute Table pane:

      <dl>
        <dt>Add</dt>

        <dd>Push this button to add a new logix route. For more
        information see <a href=
        "LRouteAddEdit.shtml">Adding/Editing LRoutes</a>.</dd>
