      <p>JMRI Signals Masts are managed in the Signal Mast Table.
      You access this tool from the <b>Tools &gt; Tables &gt;
      Signal Masts</b> menu.</p>

      <p>You may change the order of the columns by dragging their
      titles, and sort the rows by clicking one of the sort triangles
      next to a column title.<br>
      There are nine columns in the Signal Head Table:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>System Name, most often set automatically based on the
        Signal Mast connection type and other settings</li>

        <li>User Name, double click to enter your own description
        or number for this Signal Mast</li>

        <li>Aspect, this column shows the current Aspect of a
        Signal Mast. You can change it manually by selecting a
        value from the pop up list</li>

        <li>Comment, double click this field to enter text about
        the location of the Signal Mast or other notes</li>

        <li>Delete, click on this button to delete a Signal Mast.
        Use with care!</li>

        <li><a href="SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">Edit</a>, clicking on
        one of these buttons opens a panel where you can disable
        some of the available Aspects and the Lit status for this
        Signal Mast. Note: The System Name, Signal Mast type and
        driver cannot be changed once a Signal Mast has been
        created. <a href="images/VirtMastPanelApply.png"><img src=
        "images/VirtMastPanelApply.png" width="239" height="159"
        align="right"></a></li>

        <li>Edit Logic, this button opens the Signaling Pairs panel
        showing the lines for this Signal Mast, from which you can
        access the <a href=
        "../../../../html/tools/signaling/SignalMastLogic.shtml">Signal
        Mast Logic</a></li>

        <li>Lit, shows whether this Signal Mast is Lit, which can
        be changed by clicking on the checkbox, via Signal Mast
        Logic or by Logix</li>

        <li>Held, if this property is checked the Signal Mast will
        not follow the Signal Mast Logic e.g. to hold a train at
        this location waiting for orders.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>To define a new Signal Mast, click on the "<a href=
      "SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">Add..</a>" button below the Signal
      Mast Table. The window that opens next will prompt you for
      whatever setup information is needed.</p><a href=
      "images/SignalingPairs.png"><img src=
      "images/SignalingPairs.png" align="right" width="303" height=
      "122" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt="Signaling Pairs window"></a>

      <p>After you clicked on one of the "Edit Logic" buttons in
      the Signal Mast Table, the Signaling Pairs window appears.
      Choose one of the displayed lines and click the "Edit" button
      to open the Edit window.</p>

      <p>Use the <b>Store</b> item in the File menu to save signal
      information to disk. This information is saved with the
      configuration in an XML file, along with control panel setup
      and similar stuff. To store your panels in the same file
      (recommended), select <b>File &gt; Store &gt; Store
      Configuration and Panels To File...</b> or select <b>Panels
      &gt; Store panels...</b> in the main JMRI window.</p>

      including how to show signals on your panels, please see the
