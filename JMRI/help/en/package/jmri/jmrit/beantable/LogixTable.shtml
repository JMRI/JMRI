      <h1>The Logix Table</h1>

      <p>A Logix is a small group of Conditionals focused on a single task
      on the layout. Each Conditional may be viewed as a statement of the form:</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p><code>if (logical expression) then
      (action).</code></p></div>
      
      The "logical expression" part of a Conditional tests the state of a group
      of user-specified conditions on the layout, for example, whether certain
      turnouts are closed or thrown, or whether a block is occupied. The
      "action" part of the Conditional specifies what action is to be taken if
      the state of the logical expression changes.

      <p>The Logix Table lists all currently defined Logix by their
      System Name and User Name.</p>

      <h2>Columns in the Logix Table</h2>
      <p>You may change the order of the columns by dragging their titles,
      and sort the rows by clicking one of the sort triangles next to a
      column title.</p>
      <p>The last column of the table provides four things you can
      do with a Logix: Edit it, Browse it, Duplicate it, or Delete
      it. Simply clicking <strong>Select</strong> will drop down a menu with the
      choices: <strong>Edit</strong>, <strong>Browse</strong>,
      <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Selecting <strong>Edit</strong> will bring up the Edit Logix window
        which provides a way to edit a Logix and its Conditionals. See
        <a href="../conditional/ConditionalListEditor.shtml">List Editor</a> or
        <a href="../conditional/ConditionalTreeEditor.shtml">Tree Editor</a>
        help pages for more information on creating and editing Logix
        Conditionals.</li>
        <li>
        Selecting <strong>Browse</strong> will bring up the Conditional Browser
        window. The window provides a summary view of the Conditionals
        and their definitions in the Logix.  The values in brackets indicate
        the current state and for conditional variables, whether it acts as
        a trigger.
        When you are done, close the window.

        </a>
        </li>
        <li>
        Selecting <strong>Copy</strong> will bring up windows that allow you to
        make a new copy of Logix and its Conditionals or to copy its
        Conditionals into an existing Logix.</li>
        <li>
        Selecting <strong>Delete</strong> will delete the Logix and its
        Conditionals.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <strong>Enabled</strong> column allows you to enable (checked)
      or disable (unchecked) a Logix. A Logix does not have a state as many
      JMRI entities do. A Logix does have the capability of being "enabled" or
      "disabled". When a Logix is not enabled, the logical expressions of
      its Conditionals are still evaluated, but the actions specified in the
      Conditionals are not taken. When a Logix is enabled after having been
      disabled, its Conditionals are recalculated and appropriate
      actions taken.</p>

      <h2>Creating a Logix</h2>

      <p>To create a new Logix, click the <strong>Add...</strong> button at
      the bottom of the Logix Table. This will bring up a "Create
      Logix" pane. Entering a System Name and optionally a User
      Name, then clicking <strong>Create Logix</strong>, will create the
      Logix, and bring up the Edit Logix window. Once a Logix is
      created, its System Name cannot be changed. Its User Name,
      however, may be changed in either the Logix Table or the Edit
      Logix window. A new User Name may be any useful text,
      provided the new User Name was not already assigned to
      another Logix. (See also the <a href=
      "LogixAddEdit.shtml">separate help page on adding Logix</a>
      and a <a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Logix.shtml#start">step-by-step
      guide</a>.)</p>

      <h2>Logix Table Menu</h2>

      <p>The <strong>File</strong> menu at the top of the Logix Table
      provides for printing this table and for storing the Logixs
      and their Conditionals in a layout configuration file.
      Selecting either store option will bring up a dialog for
      naming a configuration file for writing Logix information and
      all other configuration information (e.g., sensors, lights,
      turnouts, signal heads, routes etc.). If you are updating an
      existing file, simply click its name, and it will be copied
      into the name entry.</p>
      
      <a name="logixOptions" id="logixOptions"></a>
      <p>The <strong>Options</strong> menu has 3 sections.<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 2em">

      <img src="images/LogixOptions.png"
      alt="Logix Options Menu" height="186" width="262">
      </a>
      </div>
      <p>The first section is used to <strong>Enable</strong> or
      <strong>Disable</strong> all of the Logix definitions.<br>
      <span class="since">since 4.7.3</span> The second section is used
      to select one of three methods for entering item names for the Logix
      Conditional Variables and Actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Traditional Pick Lists, the default method, uses a text
          field where the system or user name is entered, such as a
          turnout or sensor.  This method also provides a Pick List window
          with tabs for each type of object.  When an object is selected,
          such as a sensor, the appropriate Pick List tab is automatically selected.<br>
          Drag a name from the pick list and drop it on the name field.</li>
        <li>The Single Pick Lists method also uses a text field, but the Pick
          List only displays the names for the current object, such
          as sensors.  Clicking on a name in the Pick List will
          automatically copy the name to the text field.</li>
        <li>The Combo Name Box method changes the text field to a drop
          down combo box. Click and select an item from the list.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="since">since 4.9.2</span> The third section is used to select
      the Conditional Editor.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>List Conditional Editor - This is the traditional editor that opens
        multiple windows depending on the current activity.  This is the default
        selection. See
        <a href="../conditional/ConditionalListEditor.shtml"> List Editor</a>
        for detail information.</li>
        <li>Tree Conditional Editor -This is a single window editor that uses
        a tree structure to navigate the Conditional data for a Logix.  See
        <a href="../conditional/ConditionalTreeEditor.shtml"> Tree Editor</a>
        for detail information.

          alt="Conditional Tree Editor" height="241" width="576">
          </a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <strong>Tools</strong> menu has 5 items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open PickList Tables - Opens the tabbed Pick List tables
          as described above for the first method.</li>
        <li>Find Orphaned Items - Identify standard items, such as turnouts,
          that have been defined but never used.
        </li>
        <li>Find Empty Conditionals</li>
        <li>Find Cross References - Create a list of places where an
          item, such as a sensor, are used.
        </li>
        <li>Conditional Variable References - Create a list of conditionals
          that are referenced by other conditonals. <span class="since">since 4.7.4</span><br>
