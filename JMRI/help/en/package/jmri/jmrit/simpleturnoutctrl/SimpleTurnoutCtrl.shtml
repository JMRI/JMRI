      <h1>Turnout Control</h1>Enter the accessory number or turnout
      system name for the accessory or turnout you wish to control
      in the box to right of "turnout:". For example, entering 678
      and by pressing either the Thrown or Closed button, you
      should be able to change the state of accessory number 678 on
      the layout. Another example, a valid turnout system name for
      NCE could be NT456. Then by pressing either the Thrown or
      Closed button, you should be able to change the state of
      turnout or accessory number 456 on the layout. Another
      example, a valid turnout system name could be IT123 which is
      internal turnout number 123. Pressing Thrown or Closed will
      only change the state of the internal turnout and will not
      change a turnout on the layout. See "<a href=
      "../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Names</a>" under
      general help for more information.

      <p>For more information on JMRI Turnouts, see the <a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnout help
      page</a>.</p>

      <h2>Turnout Control Buttons and Status</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>current state:</dt>

        <dd>Shows the current known state of the turnout. A turnout
        can have four states: unknown, inconsistent, thrown, and
        closed. The unknown state is when JMRI doesn't know if the
        turnout is thrown or closed. The inconsistent state is when
        a turnout on the layout is commanded to throw or close but
        the feedback from the layout hasn't been received. Also
        note that the inconsistent state can only occur if a
        turnout has feedback. The thrown and closed states are what
        the JMRI program knows or believes is the state of the
        turnout.</dd>

        <dt>feedback mode:</dt>

        <dd>Shows the turnout's feedback mode. Some of the
        available <a href="#Feedback">feedback</a> modes are:
        DIRECT, DELAYED, ONE SENSOR, TWO SENSOR, and MONITORING. A turnout
        using DIRECT mode doesn't have feedback from the layout.
        When a close or throw command is executed the JMRI program
        assumes that the command always completes immediately. 
        DELAYED simulates the turnout operation taking a few seconds
        to complete.
        ONE SENSOR uses
        one sensor on the layout to provide feedback on the state
        of the turnout. TWO SENSOR uses two sensors for feedback,
        one for closed and one for thrown. MONITORING gets feedback
        from the system by either listening to cab commands on the
        layout or polling the system for turnout status. See the
        <a href=
        "../../../../html/doc/Technical/TurnoutFeedback.shtml">turnout
        feedback page</a> for more information.</dd>

        <dt>Thrown</dt>

        <dd>Push this button to throw the turnout.</dd>

        <dt>Closed</dt>

        <dd>Push this button to close the turnout.</dd>

        <dt>Cab operation:</dt>

        <dd>Some turnouts can be locked. If the control button is
        grayed out, the lock feature isn't available. See the
        <a href="#NCETurnoutLockFeature">NCE Turnout lock
        feature</a> below.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3><a name="NCETurnoutLockFeature" id=
      "NCETurnoutLockFeature"></a>NCE Turnout lock feature</h3>

      <p>The turnout lock feature allows you to selectively disable
      accessory (turnouts) commands from cabs. By locking a
      turnout, the JMRI program will monitor the turnout's
      accessory address and if it detects a change command from a
      cab, will cancel the command immediately by sending out the
      opposite command to the turnout.</p>

      <p>To use this feature you must select MONITORING as the
      feedback mode for the turnout and the NCE command station
      must have the 2007 or newer EPROM.</p>

      <p>To help you select a set of turnouts to lock, a route can
      be locked. All turnouts that are being monitored by the JMRI
      program and are included in the route will be locked.</p>
