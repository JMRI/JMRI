      <h2>JMRI: Multi-Decoder Control</h2>
      Originally, DCC did not
      provide a convenient way to program configuration values
      (CVs) when you have more than one decoder installed in a
      locomotive. For example, if you have separate decoders to
      control the motor and provide sound, and they both use the
      same CV locations, programming one decoder would change the
      settings on the other, usually in an undesired way.

      <p>There are various tricks that can be used with long and
      short addresses and programming on the main, but they're not
      entirely satisfactory.</p>

      <p>Digitrax <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/v1/LOCK.htm">proposed a method</a>
      for dealing with this to the <a href=
      "http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/WGpublic/0305051/0305051.html">
      DCC Working Group</a>. This was <a href=
      "http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/WGpublic/discussion_topics.html#Topic0305051">
      accepted by the NMRA</a> for inclusion in a "<a href=
      "http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/standards_rps/rp922.html#Descriptions%20of%20Configuration%20Variables%20for%20Multi-Function%20Decoders">Recommended
      Practice</a>", and has since been adopted by many
      manufacturers.</p>

      <p>The method uses CV15 and CV16 to control writing and
      reading CV values. Before the decoders are installed in the
      locomotive, each one has a specific value programmed into
      CV16. (The recommended values are 1 for the motor decoder, 2
      for a sound decoder, 3 for a function-only decoder, and 4-7
      for other uses; decoders are supposed to ship with a value of
      0 in both CV15 and CV16) A decoder will only do read and
      write operations if the values in CV15 and CV16 are the same,
      with the exception that you can always write CV15. In effect,
      CV16 is a lock and CV15 is the key.</p>

      <p><a href="../../../../images/DualDecoder.jpg"><img src=
      "../../../../images/DualDecoder.jpg" width="122" height="306"
      align="right" alt="Dual Decoder Window"></a> DecoderPro has a
      "Multi-Decoder Control" to make use of this feature easier.
      You can open it from the "Programmers" selection in the
      "Tools" menu. This opens a window, which you can also see on
      the right of this page.</p>

      <p>The top section of the window consists of eight radio
      buttons. Clicking the buttons numbered 0 to 6 will unlock the
      decoder with the corresponding number in it's lock CV (CV16).
      DecoderPro then reads back the value in CV16 to confirm that
      the decoder has successfully unlocked.</p>

      <p>Normally, one clicks the button for the decoder you want
      to program, and them moves over to the main DecoderPro window
      to read and write values.</p>

      <p>The "Legacy" button writes a 7 to CV15, which is another
      special case. Many decoders, especially older models, do not
      have this locking mechanism present. In some cases, most
      specifically a Digitrax FX3 or later decoder and an early
      SoundTraxx decoder, it's possible to emulate the lock using
      sequential writing of CVs. Clicking the "Legacy" button
      activates. Unfortunately, it's not an entirely reliable
      method.</p>

      <p>In the middle section are there buttons that can do more
      complicated operations.</p>

      <p>The "Search" button sequentially works through the
      possible addresses, marking those decoder addresses that are
      found to be present.</p>

      <p>"Reset" works through the possible combinations to unlock
      a decoder that has been inadvertantly locked. This should
      only be used if you have just one decoder in the locomotive.
      If you have more than one, it will unlock all of them, which
      may cause confusion later.</p>

      <p>"Init DH163 + Soundtraxx" configures the "Legacy" mode
      discussed above.</p>

      <p>Below that, the program displays status messages.</p>

      <p>The bottom section allows you to directly set the
      programming mode in use. If you're using ops-mode programming
      (programming on the main), you wil also need to specify the
      address of the locomotive being programmed.</p>
