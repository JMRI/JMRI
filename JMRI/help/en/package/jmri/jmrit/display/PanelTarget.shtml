      <h1>The Panel</h1>

      <p>A Panel is a set of icons representing various components
      of a layout. Some of the icons available in JMRI&copy; include
      Turnouts, Sensors and Signals Masts. You can also include a
      background icon to represent your layout on your Panel.</p>

      <p>The Panel Editor which you use to create a Panel is
      described on the <a href="PanelEditor.shtml">Panel Editor
      Help page</a>.</p>

      <h2>Panel operation</h2>

      <p>Clicking on a Turnout symbol flips it from Closed to
      Thrown and vice-versa. A Turnout also has "Unknown" and
      "Inconsistent" states, represented by an icon with a question
      mark and X respectively. These represent a state where no
      information has been received, and where the information is
      internally inconsistent (e.g. both Closed and Thrown at the
      same time).</p>

      <p>This control can be used in various ways. For example, you
      could have a Turnout Icon covering a Turnout on a schematic
      diagram. When you click on it, the Turnout on the layout
      would be commanded to change, and the track diagram would
      show which way a Train would be routed. Or you could use
      icons that show a lever to the right or left, and create a
      Panel that looks like a traditional US&amp;S Panel.</p>

      <p>"Sensors" can be used to represent occupancy indicators or
      other inputs. The default icon is a small circle, with color
      used to represent the state of the Sensor. These respond to
      changes on the layout automatically. Clicking on a Sensor
      Icon causes the Sensor to alternate between "Active" and
      "Inactive" states. With the default icons, Active is a green
      circle and Inactive is an empty circle. These are meant to
      represent a lit/dark Panel indicator. A red circle represents
      the "Unknown" state, used when no information has yet been
      received from the layout.</p>

      <h2>Creating a Panel</h2>Panels are created with the <a href=
      "PanelEditor.shtml">Panel Editor</a>, which allows you to
      place images to represent Turnouts, Sensors (on some systems)
      and trackwork.

      <h2>Popup menus</h2>

      <p>If the "Panel items popup menu active" box is checked in
      the Panel Editor, a small popup menu will appear when you
      right click an icon. Most icons allow you to Rotate and
      Remove the icon. There are other options depending on the
      type of icon, for example, you can disable a Turnout Icon so
      it doesn't actually control anything.</p>

      <p>If enabled via the checkboxes on the <a href=
      "PanelEditor.shtml">Panel Editor</a>, you can move an icon by
      dragging it around the Panel. For more precise positioning,
      many icons can access the <a href=
      "CoordinateEdit.shtml">Coordinate Editor</a> to move the icon
      by a specific number of pixels or set it to an absolute
      location.</p>

      <p>When the checkboxes in the Panel Editor permit it, the
      popup menu may include items to recall the Icon Editor to
      change the icons or the entity it represents. Other items
      likely to be available are: rotations, scaling, font sizes,
      colors etc.</p>

      <p>The popup menu may also change if the configuration of an
      item is changed. For example, if you add Feedback to a
      Turnout, the popup menu includes a new item choice called
      "Tristate". Tristate allows you to use the "Inconsistent"
      icon, which is one of the four possible icons available for a
      Turnout. Normally when you first click on a Turnout Icon it
      commands the layout to change the state of the physical
      turnout. If you use Feedback for a particular Turnout, the
      icon display will wait to hear from the layout before
      modifying the Turnout Icon to the Closed or Thrown icon. By
      using "Tristate", the icon will change immediately to the
      "Inconsistent" icon when the Turnout Icon is clicked.
      Inconsistent in this case means that I've commanded the
      Turnout to change and now we're waiting to hear if it
      actually happened. If and when the layout returns the actual
      or "known state" of the Turnout, the icon will change to that
      state. If you don't use "Tristate", when you click on the
      icon, it may take some time (milliseconds to seconds
      depending on the hardware system) before the Turnout Icon
      responds with the known state of the physical turnout.</p>

      <h2>Marker</h2>

      <p>The Panel pane menu includes an item called "Marker". You
      can use a Marker to represent a Locomotive or other device on
      your Panel. You can move the Marker around the Panel to show
      the Locomotive's current position. Markers are always
      moveable, and their popup menus are always active. To create
      a Marker, select "Add loco" or "Add loco from roster" from
      the "Marker" menu. The "Add loco from roster" option will use
      the Road Number from your Roster file as the label; if the
      Road Number wasn't entered when you created your Roster,
      PanelPro will display the DCC address of the Locomotive. To
      remove Markers from your Panel, use the "Remove markers" menu
      item.</p>

      <p>The Marker's popup menu allows you to change the Marker's
      color, font size and style. The menu also allows you to
      remove the Marker from the Panel.</p>

      <p>If you want to keep your Markers between operating
      sessions, you can save the Panel and the Markers will be
      saved to your Panel xml file.</p>
