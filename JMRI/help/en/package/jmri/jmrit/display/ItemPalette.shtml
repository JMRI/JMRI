      <h1>The Item Palette</h1>
      <b>The Item Palette</b> is used to
      place icons and text onto <b>Control Panel Editor</b> panels.
      The palette is a tabbed window with tabs for each item type.
      The common method all items use to add an item to a panel is
      "Drag and Drop". Each tab has a bordered panel labeled
      <b>Drag to Panel</b>. Drag the item inside this border over
      to your Panel. In the cases where the icon represents a layout
      device (e.g. a turnout, a sensor, etc.), you must select a
      row from a table to associate that particular device with the
      icon - and then drag the icon to the Panel.

      <h2>Iconic Items</h2>
      For those items using icons, multiple
      sets of icons are offered by the Item Palette. In each of
      these cases several different icon sets are provided by
      default. Radio buttons are used to select an icon set.For
      example, under the sensor tab you may have sets of large
      jewels, small jewels, each size with several sets with
      different colors for active and inactive - e.g. red-green,
      yellow-dark, etc.<br>
      The individual icons are displayed in the preview on the
      background of the last editor to open the Item Palette.
      <span class="since">since 4.9.7</span>
      Choosing a different background in the "View On:" combo box,
      may help in determining what parts of the icon are opaque
      and what parts are transparent.

      <p>The <b>Show Icons</b> button displays all the icons in the
      selected set.</p>

      <h3>Editing and Creating New Icon Sets</h3>
      The <b>Edit Icons</b> button opens a dialog where the icons
      may be changed by dragging new icons from the icon catalog.

      <p>Additional icon sets may be added with <b>New Icon Set</b>
      button. After giving a name to the new icon set, the edit
      dialog is displayed. Replace the red X icons with icons you
      drag from the catalogs. There is no limit on the number of
      additional icon sets that can be added to an item tab.</p>

      <p>The <b>Delete Icon Set</b> button deletes the selected
      icon set.</p>

      <p>When the Item Palette is customized with other icon sets,
      closing the Palette with the close button in the title bar
      will open a dialog box asking whether you want to save your
      changes. When changes are saved the Item Palette is stored in
      the CatalogTrees.xml file in the preferences directory.</p>

      <p>The <b>Edit Icons</b> dialog is used to delete an icon set
      or to add an additional icon set. The <b>Delete Icon Set</b>
      button deletes the selected icon set. When the <b>Add New
      Icon Set</b> button is pressed, the currently selected icon
      set is saved and an icon set with "unknown" icons is
      displayed (Dark X's). Change these icons to those you want by
      dragging icons from the icon catalog. The new icon set must
      be named in the text field at the top of the dialog. Finally,
      press the <b>Create Icon Set</b> button and the dialog is
      closed with the new icon set added to radio button list.</p>

      <h3>Table Items</h3>
      The items associated with a table (eg. Turnouts, Sensors,
      Lights, Signal Heads) have an <b>Add New Table Item</b>
      button. This button opens a dialog where a new device item
      can be added to its table. Include the System Connection
      prefix and item type in the entry, eg. "IL2".
      <br>Tabs with tables require a device to be selected (a
      row in the table) before the an icon can be dragged to a
      control panel to represent it.

      <h2>Item Palette Tabs</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Turnout</b> Both left and right turnout icon sets
        are contained in this tab. Select a turnout from the table
        and an icon set for either Right, Left, R/L Crossover,
        then drag to the panel.</li>

        <li><b>Sensor</b> Select a sensor from the table and an
        icon set, then drag to the panel.</li>

        <li><b>SignalHead</b> When a signal head is selected in the
        table, the [Show Icons] button will only display the icons
        for the valid appearances of the signal. When no row is
        selected all possible appearance icons are shown. When
        adding a new icon set, all possible appearance icons are
        shown.</li>

        <li><b>SignalMast</b> A signal mast must be selected from
        the table to drag icons for it to the panel and to display
        the icons it uses for its aspects.</li>

        <li><b>Memory</b> Select a memory location from the table.
        The three memory types each have a "Drag to Panel" area.
        Drag the item within the bordered "Drag to Panel" to the
        panel. Note that <b>Input</b> and <b>Spinner</b> types can
        only be dragged from the edges of their text boxes.</li>

        <li><b>Reporter</b> Select a reporter from the table and
        drag the item within the bordered "Drag to Panel" to the
        panel.</li>

        <li><b>Light</b> Select a light from the table and an icon
        set for either Crossed symbol, Right or Left and drag to
        the panel.</li>

        <li><b>Multisensor</b> The table displays the Sensor Table
        and the default icon set has three lever positions. For the
        default case, three rows must be selected in order from the
        table to place the multisensor icon in a panel.
        The table selections
        are labeled "first", "second", etc. and these labels
        correspond to the labels shown when the full icon set is
        displayed. When editing or creating a Multisensor icon set,
        lever positions can be added and deleted. That is, you may
        make a two sensor multisensor or a four or five sensor icon
        set. Use the <b>Add Icon</b> or <b>Delete Icon</b> button
        to add or delete lever positions.</li>

        <li><b>Icon</b> The bordered icons displayed (labeled with
        their names) can be dragged directly to a panel. Icons can
        also be dragged directly from the Icon Catalog.</li>

        <li><b>Background</b> Background icons are placed in a
        panel just as regular icons are. However, they are assigned
        the lowest display level and cannot be selected with a
        simple mouse click. Use "Control Click" to select a
        background icon. Rather than an icon, a custom background
        color can be chosen with the <b>Background Color</b>
        button. This button displays a color chooser with tabs for
        different ways to set a color.</li>

        <li><b>Text</b> The Text tab displays a text field to enter
        the text and the attribute options that renders the text.
        Font sizes styles, justification and border attributes can
        be chosen. A color chooser provides custom colors for
        fonts, background and borders.<br>
        <b>Note</b> <i>The "Enter" key must be pressed to display
        the text with its attributes in the Preview Panel.</i><br>
        Drag the item in the Preview Panel to the panel.</li>

        <li><b>RPSReporter</b> Drag the "Drag to Panel" icon to the
        panel and setup the RPSReporter from its pop up menu.</li>

        <li><b>FastClock</b> Drag the clock to the panel.</li>

        <li><b>Indicator Track</b>
        <span class="since">since 2.12</span> These are intended for
        use when track circuits are configured with OBlocks. Most
        of the items in this tab pertain to their use as
        presentations of OBlocks and their use with warrants.
        However, if OBlocks are not defined, but occupancy sensors
        are installed on the layout as track circuits, the
        <b>Occupancy Circuit</b> field will accept a sensor name.
        When this is the case only the "Occupied" and "Clear"
        colors can be displayed.</li>

        <li><b>Indicator Turnout</b> The above comment also applies to
        Indicator Turnouts.</li>

        <li><b>Portal</b> Portal icons are used in Circuit Builder to
        define Portals and Paths. On the Control Panel they also
        will display direction arrows along a route when Warrants
        are allocated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>More about Indicator Track</h2>
      <p>Indicator track (i.e. both track segments and turnouts)
      have colors to display status of
      the track circuit they represent. When the track circuit is
      configured by an OBlock, and the Portals and Paths it
      contains, the following status states are be displayed by
      color:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Clear</b> Indicates ready for use. More precisely,
        the circuit is in a known state and none of other status
        apply.</li>

        <li><b>Occupied</b> (Yellow) The track is occupied by an
        unknown train or car.</li>

        <li><b>Allocated</b> (Green) The track is reserved for use
        by a warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Train Position</b> (Blue) The track is occupied by a
        train under warrant and this is its current position.</li>

        <li><b>Not In Use</b> (Gray) The state of the track is not
        known or it has been set to be out of service. This state
        is also used when local control of blocks is granted from a
        panel.</li>

        <li><b>Power Error</b> (Red) This is the state of another
        sensor - not the occupancy sensor. If used, most likely it
        would be wired to indicate a short or power failure.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Note:</b> Configuring Indicator Track icons can be done
      in groups automatically - including automatic conversion of
      regular track icons with <b>Circuit Builder</b>. The only
      feature where you may want to edit an Indicator Track icon
      individually is picking the icon that will show the train
      name marker when the block it represents is occupied under a
      warrant. (Frequently, several icons display an OBlock and you
      only want one of them to show the marker.)</p>

      <h3>Indicator Track Tab</h3>Enter the name of the track
      circuit (OBlock) this track icon represents into the
      <b>Occupancy Circuit</b> field. The <b>Open Detector
      Picklist</b> button opens a picklist showing the defined
      OBlock track circuits. Drag or copy the name to the Occupancy
      Circuit field. <i><b>Do Not use</b> the "Sensor Table" tab of
      the picklist <b>unless</b> there are no OBlocks configured
      and you only want to use the "Occupied/Unoccupied"
      status.</i>

      <p>When a valid OBlock name is entered in the Occupancy
      Circuit field, a <b>CircuitPath</b> panel is added to the tab
      showing all the paths that have been defined for the OBlock.
      Check the paths of the track circuit that pass over this
      icon. When these paths are part of an allocated route or are
      occupied by a warranted train, they show that status by
      color.</p>

      <p>If the paths were created or edited by Circuit Builder, the
      above function is done automatically. In the future the above
      "sub"panel will be made read only.</p>

      <p>Below the Occupancy Circuit field is a checkbox labeled
      <b>Display Train Name when occupied</b>. When a warranted
      train occupies the track circuit, circuit icons having this
      box checked, show a marker with the occupying train's id.
      Most likely, you will only want one of the icons in the track
      circuit to display the train id.</p>

      <p>The <b>Icon Sets</b> radio buttons, the <b>Drag to
      Panel</b> area the <b>Show Icons</b>, <b>Edit Icons</b>
      <b>New Icon Set</b>, <b>Delete Icon Set</b> buttons function
      as described before.</p>

      <h3>Indicator Turnout Tab</h3>
      <p>This tab has the same functions as the Indicator Track tab
      with the addition of a turnout table. A turnout must be
      selected from the Turnout Table to be able to drag an icon
      to a control panel.</p>

      <p>A slight variation is that there is no <b>[Edit Icons]</b>
      button. The <b>Add New Icon Set</b> and <b>Delete Icon
      Set</b> buttons function as described before.</p>

      <p>The <b>[Show Icons]</b> button displays the icon set in
      a matrix where the rows show the status icons for each state
      of the turnout - Closed, Thrown, Inconsistent, and Unknown.
      To the right of each row in the matrix is a <b>Edit Icons</b>
      button. button. These buttons open an Edit Icons dialog for
      each row of the matrix. The <b>Hide Icons</b> button closes
      the icon matrix and returns the tab to its original view.</p>

      <p>When an <b>Edit Icons</b> button is pressed on a row of
      the icon display, an edit dialog for the row is opened. The
      icons can be changed by dragging icons from the Icon Catalog.
      Also the entire status row can be removed by the <b>Delete
      Status</b> button - or restored by the <b>Add Missing
      Status</b> button.</p>
