      <h1>Edit Layout Slip</h1>A Slip is a special piece of track
      that represents two tracks crossing at grade, with the
      ability to switch between the tracks. It can come in two
      forms as a Single or a Double Slip. The slip has four
      connection points, and two tracks, designated 1 and 2. When a
      level crossing is created, track 1 is the horizontal track,
      and track 2 is the inclined track. The angle between the two
      tracks, the incline of each track, and the length of each
      track may be varied by dragging connection points with the
      meta key pressed. The center of the level crossing may be
      positioned by dragging the center circle with the meta key
      pressed (see the help bar for which key is the meta key for
      your operating system).

      <p>Although the slip is made up of two tracks it is treated
      as a single block and can be either a <i>mainline track</i>
      or <i>side track</i> depending on the mainline track or side
      track designation of track segment connected to each track.
      If a block name is entered in the <b>Block: Name</b> field of
      the tool bar prior to creating a slip, that block is assigned
      to the slip.</p>

      <p>The edit Slip window, allows you to configure the output
      states for the two turnouts that drive the slip and test
      these prior to confirming the configuration.</p>
