      <h1>JMRI: WiFi Throttle</h1>This window controls the
      connection between WiFi throttles, e.g. an iPhone, iPod
      Touch, or Android Phone, and JMRI.

      <p>It can be set to start automatically with the "<a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Startup">Start Up</a>"
      section in the "<a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">JMRI
      Preferences</a>".</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#WiThrottle">Preferences</a>
      for the WiFi throttles can be found in the JMRI Preferences
      under the heading WiThrottle.</p>

      <p>This utility broadcasts its connection information across
      the local network, so it can be picked up by any device
      looking for the service. This eliminates having to enter
      connection information into the device. If the computer
      running JMRI is protected by a software firewall, you may
      need to disable the firewall to allow the WiFi throttle to
      connect.</p>

      <p>When using a WiFi throttle, if the computer enters sleep
      mode, control will be lost. System preferences may need to be
      adjusted to prevent the computer from putting itself to sleep
      when it is inactive. <a href=

      <p>To use your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with JMRI as a
      throttle, you run the <a href=
      "http://withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a> app on the iPhone or
      iPod Touch. The basic application is available for free
      download from the iTunes store.</p>

      <p>To use your Android device with JMRI as a throttle, you
      run the <a href="http://enginedriver.mstevetodd.com">Engine
      Driver</a> program or <a href=
      "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.digitools.digitrains">
      Digitrains</a> on the Android device. These free apps are
      available from the <a href=
      "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jmri.enginedriver">
      Google Play Store</a> or the <a href=
      "http://enginedriver.mstevetodd.com">EngineDriver site</a></p>

      <p>The protocol is described on a <a href=
      "Protocol.shtml">separate page</a>. For more on JMRI
      networking, see the <a href=
      "../../../../html/doc/Technical/Networking.shtml">networking
      technical page</a>.</p>

      <p>You can also <a href=
      "../webThrottle/webThrottle.shtml">use a web browser</a> in
      your device to <a href="../webThrottle/webThrottle.shtml">run
      trains</a> if for some reason you can't install an app on the
      device.</p>

      <h3>Function Labels</h3>Function labels can be customized for
      each roster entry through JMRI, using the Labels &amp; Media
      button. These labels will then be displayed in place of the
      generic F1, F2... on the screen of the mobile device. The
      labels can be added when a new roster entry is created, or by
      editing an existing roster entry under the Function Labels
      tab.

      <h3>Routes &amp; Turnouts</h3>The app can control any
      turnouts (and routes) that JMRI can control. NOTE:
      EngineDriver only lists turnouts and routes which have User
      Names.

      <p>Additionally, you can limit what turnouts appear. In JMRI,
      with the WiThrottle window active, there is a menu named
      WiThrottle. It has an item titled "Filter Controls" that will
      let you pick which turnouts to display or hide.</p>

      <h3>Advanced Consisting</h3>There are now two options for how
      Advanced (or Decoder Assisted) Consisting is handled. This
      can be selected from the <a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#WiThrottle">WiThrottle</a>
      portion of JMRI Preferences.

      <p>The default is <b>NMRA Format</b>. This will build a
      consist using NMRA consisting commands. It does not use any
      techniques specific to the connected DCC system. This allows
      WiFi throttles to work in a DCC manufacturer independent way.
      These consists may perform better for building and
      controlling with WiFi devices.</p>

      <p>The second option is <b>DCC Brand-Specific</b> which will
      build consists in a manner where they will function as though
      built using a throttle from the DCC manufacturer. This will
      follow manufacturer specific features as to how consists are
      built and controlled. These consists should perform better
      when built with a WiFi device, but controlled by a throttle
      from the DCC manufacturer of your system.</p>
