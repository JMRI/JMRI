      <h1>Warrants: The Occupancy Block Tables</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      The Occupancy Block (OBlock) Tables were
      developed to define the elements needed to create
      "<a href="../logix/Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>"
      that allow trains to run automatically over predetermined
      routes. It was also a design goal to generate these routes
      automatically by merely specifying the origin and destination
      of Trains. Furthermore, it was designed for use by Logix so
      that users can define and control automated Trains running
      from Panel Editor panels of their own design.

      <h3>What are Portals and why use them?</h3>

      <p>Occupancy Blocks, or more properly named "track circuits",
      are portions of track having one or more Sensors to detect
      occupancy by Trains. These rail blocks, called
      <b>OBlocks</b>, are usually separated by gaps cut in the
      track which isolate the detecting sensors. However this is
      not always the case, since optical sensors might also be used
      to detect occupancy in a section of track. But whatever
      method is used to determine a block and the means of
      detecting its occupancy, there is some point that separates
      one block from another block. This dividing line between two
      blocks, whether a physical gap or an imaginary line, marks a
      transition from one block to another. These transition points
      are called <b>Portals</b>.</p>

      <p>Undoubtably you created Blocks on your layout because it was
      important for you to know when one section of track was
      exited and another was entered. One or more track circuits
      might be grouped together to make a prototypical Block, i.e.
      a section of track whose use is governed by signals. This can
      provide Interlocking. The Signals governing a Block are
      logically placed at the Portal points. If you have signals on
      your layout, consider where they are located. Most likely
      they are placed near dividing points between Blocks. So
      regardless of the name, Portals are a significant
      concept.</p>

      <h3>OPaths through Portals</h3>

      <p>There may be many ways to traverse an OBlock. For example,
      in the diagram below both OPaths 31a and 31b traverse Block 31.
      <br>
      A Path within a Block will enter at one Portal and exit through
      another Portal. See for example Path 31b in the diagram,
      which enters Block 31 through Portal 2-31b and exits via
      Portal 31-5.<br>
      Or a Path may terminate within the Block, that is, the Path
      is a spur. Again, Portals are a useful concept to indicate
      these entrance and exit points.</p>

      <p>Note that a Path must have at least one Portal for an
      entry/exit point and cannot have more than two Portals. A
      <b>Path</b> is unambiguously defined by specifying the
      Turnouts and their settings for a Train to proceed safely
      through the Block.</p>

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      Warrants and the Occupancy Tables use the following elements:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Blocks</b> are implemented in JMRI as OBlocks, which
          are extensions of JMRI Blocks. They have the following
          characteristics:

          <ul>
            <li>An OBlock has from 1 to N Portals.</li>

            <li>Although an OBlock can be defined without a Sensor,
            i.e. a "Dark Block", it should have a Sensor. If it has
            more than one Sensor, these Sensors should be "OR"ed
            together and trigger a single internal Sensor for the
            Block.</li>

            <li>An OBlock has from 1 to M Ppaths.</li>

            <li>An OBlock has 0 to K Turnouts.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Portals</b> separate Blocks. They have the following
          characteristics:

          <ul>
            <li>A Portal has exactly two Blocks (no more, no
            less)</li>

            <li>A Portal may have 0 to 2 Signals. If a Portal has a
            Signal, it faces one of its Blocks. A second Signal, if
            it exists, faces the other Block. Each Signal controls
            the movement of a Train exiting the Block it faces and
            thus the entrance of the Train to the other Block.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Paths</b> traverse a Block. They are implemented as
          JMRI OPaths, which are extensions of JMRI Paths. They
          have the following characteristics:

          <ul>
            <li>An OPath has 0 to N Turnouts.</li>

            <li>An OPath has at least one, and no more than two,
            Portals.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>How OBlocks, Portals and OPaths are used is described in
      the <a href="../logix/Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a> Help. You
      may want to browse that before reading further.

      <p>OBlocks, Portals and OPaths can be created and edited by
      the using the methods described below, or they can also be
      created and edited from a WYSIWYG graphical interface
      described in the <a href=
      "../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a>
      Help.</p>

      <p>Circuit Builder can be used you if you have a track
      diagram using track icons showing your layout. Otherwise you
      will need to use the tables below. See <a href=
      "../logix/OBlockEdit.shtml">Creating and Editing OBlocks,
      Portals and OPaths</a> for more details on using the
      tables.</p>

      <h2>Tables of the Occupancy Block, Portal, Path
      Frame</h2>
      <a href="images/OBlockWindow.png"><img src=
      "images/OBlockWindow.png" align="right" width="701" height=
      "287" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt=
      "OBlock Tables frame in JMRI 4.3.4"></a>

      <p>The tables defining these elements are contained within a
      single frame that can be minimized or closed. The individual
      table frames can be minimized within this parent frame using
      the familiar OS window buttons.</p>

      <p>Each of the tables in the Occupancy Block, Portal, Path
      Frame has a bottom row with blank entries. Entering data into
      these entries and pressing the 'Enter' key will create a new
      item in the table. 'Drag and Drop' and 'Copy and Paste' are
      implemented to provide easy ways to move text from table to
      table.</p>

      <h3>Columns in the Occupancy Block Table</h3>
      Each Occupancy Block on your layout should be entered as a
      row in this table, listing:

      <ul>
        <li><b>System Name</b>: The System Name of the OBlock. The
        system letter 'O', and type letter 'B' is used for 'OBlock'
        although the implementation is not system-specific.<br>
        If these letters are not entered they are automatically
        prepended.</li>

        <li><b>User Name</b>: The User Name of the OBlock.</li>

        <li><b>Comment</b>: You may enter any text in this field
        you wish.</li>

        <li><b>Sensor</b>: The Sensor that detects occupancy of the
        Block.</li>

        <li><b>State</b>: Shows a bit map of the Occupancy Sensor's
        state. Click on the cell to see the word values.</li>

        <li><b>Length</b>: The length of the Block (see next line
        for units). This is an important parameter if you use NX
        Warrants.</li>

        <li><b>Units</b>: The unit used to determine the length
        (inches or centimeters).</li>

        <li><b>Speed Notch</b>: An optional speed limit for the
        Block. A drop-down box lists the Signal Aspects controlling
        speed. A blank entry indicates any speed restriction will
        continue to be enforced. This should be the typical
        setting. "Normal" indicates speed will return to the
        previous normal speed.</li>

        <li><b>Paths</b>: A button that opens the <b>Block-Path</b>
        Table where the Paths of this Block are entered. This table
        is described below.</li>

        <li><b>Delete</b>: A button to delete the Block. To make
        the deletion permanent, save your configuration file to
        disk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This table is initially sorted by the System Name of the
      OBlocks. This means that when a new row is added the entry will jump
      to its position in the sort. After entering a new OBlock, you
      may find it at the top of the window should you need to do
      further editing.<br>
      <span class="since">since 2.12</span>You can sort the table by
      clicking on a column header.</p>

      <p>Several columns are hidden in the OBlock table. To
      hide/unhide a column, right click in the Header portion of
      the table.</p>

      <h3>Columns in the Portal Table</h3>

      <p>The Portal table has columns for the blocks it separates.
      You do not need to be concerned about the direction of travel
      through the portal. <i>It does not matter which side of the
      portal the blocks names are entered</i>, since the algorithms
      that compute train routes will decipher the correct entrance
      and exit points.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Block Name</b>: The user or system name of the
        OBlock on one side of the Portal.</li>

        <li><b>Portal Name</b>: The portal name. The names of
        portals must be unique.</li>

        <li><b>Block Name</b>: The user or system name of the
        OBlock on the other side of the Portal.</li>

        <li><b>Delete</b>: A button to delete the Portal. To make
        the deletion permanent, save your configuration file to
        disk</li>
      </ul>This table is sorted by Portal Name. This means that
      when a new row is added the entry will jump to its position
      in the sort. After entering a new Portal, you may find it at
      the top of the window for further editing.

      <h3>Columns in the Signal Table</h3>For each signal on your
      layout, make an entry in the Signal Table. This Signal will
      control the actions of any warranted train - changing its
      speed according to the Signal's indication when the train
      reaches the Portal where the signal is placed. That is, the
      Signal 'protects' the Blocks beyond the Portal. The Signal
      may be either a <b>Signal Mast</b> or a <b>Signal Head</b>.

      <ul>
        <li><b>Signal Name</b>: Enter the name of the Signal,
        either the System Name or User Name (In the case where the
        same name is used for both a Signal Mast and Signal Head,
        the Signal Mast will be chosen by the program).</li>

        <li><b>From (Approach) Block</b>: Enter the name, either
        System Name or User Name, of the Block that the Signal
        faces. The Signal controls the movement of a Train exiting
        from the approach Block and entering into the protected
        Block.</li>

        <li><b>(Through) Portal</b>: Enter the name of the Portal
        where the Signal is placed.</li>

        <li><b>To (Protected) Block</b>: Enter the name, either
        System Name or User Name, of the Block whose entrance is
        protected by the Signal.</li>

        <li><b>Length</b>: (Optional) The length add or subtract to
        point where a speed change required by the Signal's Aspect
        should begin. Often this equals the distance from where the
        mast of the signal is placed to where the gap of the Block
        it protects is.</li>

        <li><b>Units</b>: The unit used to determine the offset
        length (in inches or centimeters).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How Signal Aspects change Speed</h3>A Warrant detects the
      signal Aspect when it's train enters the <i>approach</i>
      Block and - if needed - prepares to change the speed before
      it reaches the <i>protected</i> Block. Any speed change is
      ramped down to the speed required by the Signal. The Warrant
      calculates when the speed ramp-down should begin using the
      parameters involved with the Speed Profile or throttle factor
      of the engine (see <a href=
      "Warrant.shtml#SpeedMap">Warrants</a>). The point where the
      speed change should complete can be adjusted (+/-) by the
      above <b>Length</b> amount, should that be desirable.

      <p>Likewise, when the Signal indicates a Clear or increased
      speed from a stopped or reduced speed condition, the speed
      will be ramped up to the allowed or recorded speed.</p>

      <h3>Columns in Block-Path Tables</h3>
      Each Block in the Occupancy Block Table will have one or more
      Paths in it.
      Pressing the <b>Paths</b> button in a row of the Occupancy
      Block Table will open this table. <i>Direction of the path is
      immaterial</i>. 'from' and 'to' do not have to correspond to
      any particular side of the Block; they are just Portal names
      for the Path that traverses from 'this portal' to 'that
      portal'.

      <ul>
        <li><b>From Portal</b>: The Portal name of one
        entrance/exit point of the Path.</li>

        <li><b>Path Name</b>: The name of the Path. Path names only
        have to be unique within the Block. E.g, "Westbound Main"
        could be used as the Path Name in all the Blocks of the
        "Westbound Main" on your layout.</li>

        <li><b>To Portal Name</b>: The Portal name of the other
        entrance/exit point of the Path.</li>

        <li><b>Turnouts</b>: A button that opens the
        <b>Block-Path-Turnout</b> table, where the turnouts that
        define the Path are entered. This table is described
        <a href="#oblockpathturnout">below</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Delete</b>: A button to delete the Path. To make the
        deletion permanent, save your configuration file to
        disk</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="oblockpathturnout" id="oblockpathturnout"></a>
      <h3>Columns in Block-Path-Turnout Tables</h3>If the Path
      crosses a Turnout, then it is necessary to have the Turnout
      in the correct position in order to traverse the Path. This
      table is used to define these settings (if the path does not
      cross any turnouts, this table is left empty). Note there
      will be lots of these tables, one for each path in each Block
      of the Occupancy Block Table.

      <ul>
        <li><b>System/User Name</b>: The System Name or User Name
        of the Turnout in the Path.</li>

        <li><b>Turnout Setting</b>: the position of the Turnout to
        make the path</li>

        <li><b>Delete</b>: A button to delete the Turnout settings.
        To make the deletion permanent, save your configuration
        file to disk</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Columns in the Block-Portal Cross Reference Table</h3>
      This is a read only table to assist in identifying all the Portals
      to a Block. It lists all the Portals that have been defined
      for each Block, grouped under each Block heading. It is
      opened from the <a href="#oblockcrossref"><b>Show
      Block-Portal Cross Reference</b></a> menu item.

      <h2>Menus of the Occupancy Block, Portal, Path frame</h2>

      <h3>The File menu</h3>
      This menu has the standard menu items for saving configuration
      files and panels.

      <h3>The Edit menu</h3>
      This menu has the standard menu items for Cut, Copy and Paste.

      <h3>The Open Tables menu</h3>
      This menu has items to open the tables in the Occupancy Block,
      Portal, Path frame:

      <ul>
        <li><b>Show Occupancy Block Table</b>: Opens the Occupancy
        Block window, if it is minimized. This table cannot be
        closed.</li>

        <li><b>Show Portal Table</b>: Opens the Portal window, if
        it is minimized. This table cannot be closed.</li>
