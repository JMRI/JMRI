<!-- A command station is configured by picking one specific value  -->
<!-- from a series of choices for each of a number of options.      -->
<!-- Some options represent closed/thrown of a single opswitch, in  -->
<!-- which case the obvious two choices are defined.  Other options -->
<!-- represent things that require setting a number of opswitches   -->
<!-- in a consistent pattern.  -->
