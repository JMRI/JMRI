  <!-- This file sets the values returned by the SignalSpeedMap class.  It is designed to -->

  <!-- The "aspectSpeeds" table below maps the speed names used in signal aspects.xml  -->
  <!-- files to a number. The number may be translated to a throttle setting.  The     -->
  <!-- meaning of the number may be given different interpretations:               -->
  <!--   "percentNormal" is the percentage of the recorded speed, i.e. the speed       -->
  <!--      when running with no signals or aspect clear.  With this choice a speed    -->
  <!--      change will always be made when a restrictive aspect is signaled.  Use     -->
  <!--      care that the values are not too low, as that may stop the train when only -->
  <!--      a reduction of speed was desired given that one may be taking a percentage -->
  <!--      of a slow recorded speed.                                                  -->
  <!--   "percentThrottle" is the percentage of the full throttle speed, i.e. the      -->
  <!--      number is an absolute throttle setting.  This choice is best when the      -->
  <!--      motive roster is speed matched and one chooses values that has the trains  -->
