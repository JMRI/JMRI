# Used in operations.
# Sample script that will set a wait value for all cars in a specific train.
# Useful if you want the cars set out by the train to remain unavailable for
# other trains.  A wait value of 1, means the next train built will not use
# cars from this train.
#
# Use this script after the train has been built.

# To use this script you must assign the train that you want the cars waited, 
# and the wait value.
