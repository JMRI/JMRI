# Script to go through each open panel, walk down the object 
# hierarchy and search for all ReporterIcon objects.
#
# Every ReporterIcon will have its font size and colour set as  
# specified at the top of the script
#
# In addition to being a useful tool in itself, this is a good example
# of stepping through the object structure of a panel.
