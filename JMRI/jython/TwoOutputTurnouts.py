# Drive a turnouts from two CMRI connections.
#
# Some CMRI users connect slow-motion switch machines between
# two CMRI outputs, and then set the outputs to complementary 
# states (one active, one inactive) to drive the machine in
# the two directions.
#
# This script slaves a 2nd turnout to a first one, so that when the
# first one is commanded to a particular state, the second one
# goes to the other state
#
# To use this, edit the script to include your turnouts at the bottom
# (see the existing example; you should remove that)
# Then select it as a script to be run at startup from the "Advanced
# Preferences" on the preferences window
