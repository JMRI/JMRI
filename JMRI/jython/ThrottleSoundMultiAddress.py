# This script as described in the file preamble, is based on the JMRI
# ThrottleSound.py script, but has been altered to allow the user to link
# wav files to an unlimited (seemingly)number of loco addresses. I am
# using 114 loco addresses and files at the moment. Wav files are played
# for specified loco address on handheld, command station, of virtual JMRI
# throttles when F3 is pressed. I experience some fussiness used through
# loconet: sometimes double pressing F3 is needed, and system asks to
# steal loco address, and a failure to play at times. This seems a
# function of the complexity of loconet, as the script runs seamlessly
# when created and tested with virtual throttle on loconet simulator.
# 
# Still, you may enjoy this or find answers of your own. Users can
# determine their own needs. I use it to read off loco information about
# the model, the prototype, and info about consisting and speed
# matching.....as opposed to me looking for the correct page in my info
# binders or turning my head from the layout operation to read something.
# 
# It has many presentational possibilites also. I have expanded it to also
# link to historical data about the prototype and the rail line etc. Guest
# users and I can access this info at any time by pressing F3 on the
# throttle (though I believe I can also alter it to use one or more
# additional throttle keys.) As with all scripts, accuracy if critical in
# writing your lines, copying and pasting wav file names etc. A single
# error/omission in any of the hundreds of lines will cause the script to
# not perform. Various formats can be used for initial line entries. This
# writer used a1= a2= a3=....a114= etc. Though formats cannot be mixed. As
# for the data itself, to facilitate this use, I scan print data and
# convert information to .wav format using a good version of
# text-to-speech software. Producing or live recording the amount of data
# I currently have available for playback with the throttle would be
# daunting, but not impossible for those with their own ideas. 
# 
# Obviously this is a simple adaptation of others' creative work. The original
# authors of the ThrottleSound.py script and Ken Cameron very kindly
# showed me the template for proceeding.

# Play sound file for any particular loco address when the F3 key is pressed on the 
# handheld or JMRI
#
# This sample shows script for only17 files.  This writer is currently using 114 files for 114
# loco addresses elsewhere
#
# Only the first .wav file in the sample is part of the JMRI distribution
# This script is based on the ThrottleSound script authored by
