# Reset a turnout to Closed every time it's clicked Thrown
#
# This might be used so that a turnout icon on a panel sits 
# in one position, ready to be clicked and fire a route
#
# The top of the file defines the needed code.  There are some
# lines near the bottom you should edit to adapt it to your 
# particular layout.
