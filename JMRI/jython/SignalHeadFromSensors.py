# If you have an external signal system, not run
# by JMRI, and you want to put SignalHeads on a 
# JMRI panel, this script will listen to Sensors
# that are connected to that external signal system
# and drive the appearance of a SignalHead within JMRI.
#
# Note that the SignalHead objects need to have been
# previously defined, e.g. by a panel file. If you
# just want to put them on a panel, they can be Virtual SignalHeads,
# or they can be of a type that'll drive real hardware, whatever
# you need; the script doesn't care.
