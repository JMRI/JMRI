#
# Listener for Loconet MULTI_SENSE_POWER Autoreverse/ShortCircuit messages from PM42's
# that contain status (OK or SHORT) for each of the 4 channels
#
# When a PM42 message is received, update Internal Sensors
#  ISPM_nn1, ISPM_nn2, ISPM_nn3 and ISPM_nn4
#  representing PM42 sections 1 through 4
#  where "nn" is the address of the PM42 in hex
#
# The Internal Sensor state is set to ACTIVE if the PM42 reports the section
#  is set for short circuit mode and the state of the section is active.  
# The Internal Sensor state is set to INACTIVE if the PM42 reports the section
#  is set for autoreverse mode or the state of the section is ok.
#
# Note: Internal Sensor states are undefined until a message is received from
# the PM42
#
# message parsing code patterned after lnmon.java

# Start Panelpro Select Tools - Tables - Sensors - Sensor tables 
# Click Add  System name. in the small window that opens enter System Name - ISPM_nn1  Where nn is
# your pm42 board id and User name which can be a decription # of the Power District 
#E.G Yard or Power District 1, whatever helps you remember what the sensor is monitoring.
# If you make a mistake click the delete button, you will get a warning that object is in use by at
# least 1 item, just ignore it in this case and click Yes.
# Now to add LEDS to your panel, Load your panel and open panel or layout editor
# In the box next to add Sensor enter your first sensor name ISPM_nn1
# click the change icon button, scroll to the LED icons section.  I use a small red led for unknown or
# inconsistent state a large red led icon for active and a green led for inactive.
# Now go to your panel and move the icon to the appropriate place on the screen.  You can click on the
# icon and it should cycle trough all the colors you selected.
# Repeat for ISPM_nn2 through ISPM_nn4. 
# The final step is to have this scipt load every time you start your PanelPro application.
# On PanelPro or Decoder Pro Screen  Select Edit - Preferences
# Once the screen opens click the Show Advanced Preferences box
# Scroll down to the run scripts at startup section - Click Add Script - scroll to where your
# scripts are stored - On windows normally c:\Program Files\JMRI\Jython\your script name here.
# click open and your script will now appear on the preferences screen. When you restart PanelPro
# or DecoderPro this scrpt will load with your panel.
