# Script that controls an IoT (internet of things) device using HTTP GET commands.
# This is an example on how to control other devices from JMRI.
# It uses this ethernet double relay: http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/eth002tech.htm
# (this link explains how it works and how to configure and use it)
# You may find different devices on the market that are controlled by HTTP GET commands.
#
# What this script does for me:
#
# It turns AC mains power ON when it starts and turns it OFF when JMRI shuts down.
# (for my layout power needs: Command Station, Lights, several power adapters, ...)
# I enter the room, turn on the lights, turn on the computer (well, it is always on) and just start JMRI.
# As soon as JMRI starts, my layout command station and several power adapters connected to the relays circuit turn ON.
# When I want to finish the session, I just close JMRI, turn off the lights and exit the room.
#
# I am using the two relays - each relay to cut the circuit for each electrical wire
#
# *** Be carefull working with AC mains power - it is dangerous ***
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The script should be loaded at start up (preferencies)
