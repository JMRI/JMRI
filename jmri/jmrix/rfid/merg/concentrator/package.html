<h2>To Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>The 0x00 that's send as part of the interlocking doesn't show
in the serial monitor
<li>The clock setting is way too simple, see setClock in CM11AGateway.
Also, does that have the right house code handling?  Can the interface handle 
more than one house code?
<li>No provision for e.g. a CM10, with it's slightly separate codes.
</ul>
