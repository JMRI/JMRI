Defines classes for interfacing to a CAN based model railway
control bus.

<p>
It is expected that there will be multiple CAN implementations (e.g. MERG
CBUS or ATBUS) each accessible through a variety of CAN adapters (e.g. 
CAN232 or MERG CAN-RS), but that each implementation will be based uppon
basic CANbus concepts such as ID (standard or extended), Normal and RTR
frames and a data field.

<p>
This package is therefore organized in several subtrees:
<dl>
<dt>adapters
<dd>Specific implementations for CAN adapter hardware, e.g. 
<a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/resources/lcb.html">MERG</a>'s <a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/resources/lcb.html#CAN_RS">CAN_RS</a>; 
<a href="http://canusb.com/">LAWICEL AB</a>'s <a href="http://canusb.com/">CANUSB and CAN232</a>; etc.
<dt>protocols
<dd>Specific implementations for e.g. CBUS, NmraNet, etc
<dt>swing
<dd>Swing-based GUI tools
