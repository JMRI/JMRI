This directory holds the Mac OS X "application bundles" for JMRI.

An application bundle is a directory in the Unix sense, though
Mac OS X displays it as a single icon.

Because CVS doesn't version directories very well, and because
the directory structure (e.g. empty ones) may be significant in
the future, we've explictly versioned the directories with V1, etc.
Those numbers do not correspond to a JMRI version or anything
like that.
