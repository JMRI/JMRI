<H1>Adding/Editing Logix Conditionals</H1>
<P>The Edit Conditional window is where logical expressions are set
up and where actions are specified. The Edit Conditional window is
displayed when a Conditional is created, or when the <B>Edit</B> button
of a Conditional is pressed in the 
<a href="LogixAddEdit.shtml">Edit Logix window</a>. The Edit
Conditional window displays the system name and user name of the
Conditional at the top. The system name is automatically set by the
program and cannot be changed. The user name may be edited by
entering/modifying the text in the User Name field. The user name may
not be the same as the user name of another Conditional in this Logix,
but may be the same as the user name of a Conditional in a different
Logix.</P>
<P>Next are two sections--one for the setup of a logical expression
and one for set up of actions. Conditionals are statements of the form:</P>
<UL>
	if (logical expression) then (action).
</UL>
A Conditional has two distinct parts: its "logical expression" and its
"action". The window has separate sections for the set up of each.
</p>
<P>The logical expression section contains a table of state
variables, with two buttons below.  The first
column in the state variables table displays the row number of the 
state variable.  This is only of importance when the <b>Logic Operator</b>
choice is set to 'Mixed'.  The second column contains an automatic AND when
the <b>Logic Operator</b> choice is set to 'AND' or an automatic OR
when the choice is 'OR'.  When the choice is 'Mixed' the user may 
select AND or OR as needed.   The third column contains a choice box that allows the
user to select the NOT operator as needed. The fourth column is a description
of the state variable typeand the condition for which it is to be tested. Next
is a column displaying the current state for the test description.
The state displayed includes the effect
of the NOT operator, if NOT is selected. 
<P>The Triggers Calculation column contains checkboxes that normally
are checked, so that a change in the state variable will trigger a
calculation of the Logix. For those rare cases where a change in a
specific entity (sensor, turnout, etc.) should not trigger a
calculation result, you should uncheck the checkbox by clicking on it.
Unchecking the checkbox tells the program to monitor that entity for
state changes and calculate the stae of the Conditional, but take no
action on the result of the calculation.
</P>
<P>The last two columns of the table (<B>Edit</B> and <B>Delete</B> buttons)
are used to edit or delete that row in the state variable table.
delete a state variable if you decide it is no longer needed. The State
column of the table shows the state (true or false) of each state
variable when it is evaluated.  
</p>
<p>For the logical expression, and
therefore the Conditional, to calculate true, all state variables
must evaluate to true.</P>
<P>At any time during the entry of state variable data, <B>Check
State Variables</B> may be clicked to check entered data and evaluate state
variables. When this button is pressed, checking and evaluation proceeds
until the check completes successfully, or an error is detected. If an
error is detected, checking stops for you to correct the error and click
<B>Check State Variables</B> again. <i>Please remember after editing
name and data items to click a different cell in the table before
clicking <B>Check State Variables</B> (or <B>Update Conditional</B> at
the bottom of the window) so that the program is notified that you have
finished your entry. Otherwise your entry may not take effect, and an
error may be reported unnecessarily.</i></P>

<p>
The default <b>Logic Operator</b> is 'AND'.  In this case the Conditional 
will test if all variable tests are true, after taking the
"NOT" negations into account.
Using the <b>Logic Operator</b> box below the list of variables, you can
change that to "OR" or "Mixed".  "OR" means the conditional will be
true if any one of the variable tests are true, after accounting for the negations.
Selecting "Mixed" will let you enter a logical expression in a new 
text box using AND's, 'OR's and NOT's and the row numbers.  
In this expression, 
each variable is referred to by number, e.g. R1, R2, R3
for the 1st three variables, you can use the operators "and", "or" 
and "not" in addition to parentheses.
Some examples:
<pre>
   R1 and R2
   R1 or (R2 and R3)
   (R2 and R3) or (R3 and R1)
</pre>
<H2>Adding a New State Variable</H2>
        <p>Press the <b>Add State Variable</b> to add a state 
	variable (a row in the state variables table).  This brings up a
        window with a choice box for the user to select a state variable type.
        Available state  variables are documented 
	<a href="#variable">below</a>.  When a type is choosen the Edit Variable
        window displays a text field for the name of the entity to be used for
        the state variable. 
        When a name (either system name or user
	name) is entered, it must correspond to an existing entity (sensor, turnout, 
	light, etc.). It is useful to open the Sensor Table when entering sensor 
	names, or the Turnout Table to show available turnouts, etc.</p>
	<p><b>Caution:</b> If you use user names to specify state variables be 
	careful when editing your user names or you may break your state variable
	definitions. The user name specified must match, character for character, 
	including blanks, the actual user name of the sensor, turnout, etc., for 
	your state variables to work. If you want to be able to freely edit your 
	user names, use system names to define your state variables.</p>
	<p>At any time during the entry 
	of state variable data, the <b>Check State Variables</b> button may be 
	clicked to check the entered data and evaluate the state variables. When
	this button is pressed, the checking and evaluation proceeds until the
	check completes successfully, or an error is detected. If an error is 
	detected, the checking stops for the user to correct the error and click
	<b>Check State Variables</b> again. <i>Please remember after editing the 
	system name and data items to click a different cell in the table before 
	clicking <b>Check State Variables</b> (or <b>Update Conditional</b> at 
	the bottom of the window) so that the program is notified that you have 
	finished your entry. Otherwise your entry may not take effect, and an error 
	may be reported unnecessarily.</i></p>

<H2>Adding a New Action</H2>

<P>The action section of the Edit Conditional window provides for
specifying the actions to be taken when a Conditional is
calculated. 

<P>To add a new action, press the "Add Action" button.
A new "Edit Action" window will appear.
Select an action type in the
type box, and data items needed to completely specify the action will
appear to the right of the type box. If you don't know what needs to be
entered in a data field, hover your cursor over it, and a hint message
will appear. When a name must be entered, the name must correspond to
the system name or the user name of an existing entity (sensor, turnout,
signal head, etc.) of the proper type. Opening the Sensor Table when
entering sensor names, or the Turnout Table to see available turnouts,
etc., may be useful. Available action types are described in detail <A
	HREF="#action">below</A>.</P>
<P>For each action, three options are available for when to trigger
the action: 1) On Change to True, 2) On Change to False, and 3) On
Change. These refer to the calculated state of the Conditional, which is
equal to the value of the logical expression as specified in the state
variable table. One of these options must be selected. When done, click either
"Update" to install your changes, 
"Cancel" to close the window without any changes 
or "Delete" to remove the action entirely.</P>

<p>Actions are evaluated in the order listed.  To change that order, 
click the "Reorder" button on the "Edit Conditional" window. The right-most
buttons by the actions will then let you select the first one, next one, etc.

<P>When the logical expression and actions have been specified,
click <B>Update Conditional</B> at the bottom of the window. This
initiates a check of the logical expression (the same as done by <B>Check
State Variables</B>) and a check of entered data for actions. If the user
name has been edited, it is also checked. If an error is found, a
message box opens announcing the error, and the update is stopped to
allow you to correct the error and click <B>Update Conditional</B>
again. If no error is found, the action is updated with the entered
data, the Edit Conditional window is closed, and the user is returned to
the Edit Logix window.</P>
<P>Two other buttons are available at the bottom of the Edit
Conditional window. Clicking <B>Cancel</B> will close the Edit
Conditional window without updating the Conditional. Clicking <B>Cancel</B>
results in loss of any data that has been entered. The other button, <B>Delete
Conditional</B>, provides an easy way to delete an unneeded Conditional.
Click <B>Delete Conditional</B> to delete the Conditional being edited
and return to the Edit Logix window.</P>

<P>Available state variables and actions are listed below. For more
information, consult the Logix documentation on the JMRI web page
http://jmri.sourceforge.net/ .</P>

<DT CLASS="left"><A NAME="variable">
<H2>Available State Variables</H2>
</A></DT>

<P>State variables that are currently available for use in
Conditionals are listed below, along with information on each. State
variables must always evaluate to either true or false. The condition
resulting in true is given for each. If the condition is not met, the
state variable evaluates to false. When a Logix is active, the states of
entities (sensor, turnout, light, etc.) specified in state variables in
its Conditionals are monitored, unless the Triggers Calculation checkbox
of the state variable is unchecked. A calculation of all Conditionals in
the Logix is triggered when any monitored state changes as noted below
(if not obvious).</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>Sensor Active</B>: Evaluates to true if the state of the
	specified sensor is active.</LI>
	<LI><B>Sensor Inactive</B>: Evaluates to true if the state of the
	specified sensor is inactive.</LI>
	<LI><B>Turnout Thrown</B>: Evaluates to true if the known state of

	the specified memory is the same as the value specified in the state
	variable. Calculation is triggered when the monitored memory value
	changes to or from the specified value.</LI>
	<LI><B>Fast Clock Range</B>: Evaluates to true if the current fast
	clock time is between the begin time and end time specified for the
	range. Times must be specified in hh:mm format, where hh is hours and
	mm is minutes, relative to a 24-hour clock. Calculation is triggered
	when the fast clock time enters the range and when the fast clock time
	exits the range.</LI>
	<LI><B>Signal Red</B>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of the
	specified signal head is red. Calculation is triggered when the
	appearance change to or from red.</LI>
	<LI><B>Signal Yellow</B>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of
	the specified signal head is yellow. Calculation is triggered when the
	appearance change to or from yellow.</LI>
	<LI><B>Signal Green</B>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of
	the specified signal head is green. Calculation is triggered when the
	appearance change to or from green.</LI>

	appearance of the specified signal head is flashing green. Calculation
	is triggered when the appearance change to or from flashing green.</LI>
	<LI><B>Signal Lit</B>: Evaluates to true if the specified signal
	head is lit.</LI>
	<LI><B>Signal Held</B>: Evaluates to true if the specified signal
	head is being held.</LI>
