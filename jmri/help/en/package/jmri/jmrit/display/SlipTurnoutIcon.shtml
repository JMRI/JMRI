<H1>The Slip Turnout Editor</H1>

<p>The slip turnout editor handles turnouts that require more than one accessory
(turnout) address and have more than two routes through the turnout.
<p>This includes ..
<ul>
<li>Double Slips
<li>Single Slips
<li>Three way turnouts
<li>Scissor or Double Crossings
</ul>
<p>The way icons are changed in the SlipTurnout Icon Editor is the same as they 
are changed in the other Icon Editors.  The <b>Change Icon...</b>button and the 
Catalog function identically with other Icon Editors. The <b>Find Icons</b> 
menu and its items are 
also identical.<p>  See the <a href="IconAdder.shtml">Icon Editors page</a> 
and the <a href="../catalog/ImageIndex.shtml">Image Index Editor page</a>
for details on their use.

<H2>Contents of the SlipTurnout Icon Editor</H2>
<p>Each type of "Slip" uses a fixed number of turnouts and routes.  
Typically each "Slip" uses two turnouts and has between three and four different 
routes.

<p>Each slip must have all the turnouts required added, when all the turnouts are 
assigned, the <b>Add to Panel</b> button will become active and it can be pressed
to install the Slip into the Panel.
<p>To select the type of Slip complex that is being used, use the radio buttons 
at the top of the window.<p>

<p>Details about how each type of slip should be configured and operate can be
found below.

<H3>Double Slip</H3>
<img src="images/DoubleSlip.png" align="right">
<p>The Double Slip, uses a pair of turnouts to set the four possible routes that 
are available.  Simply drag a row from the Turnout table to place into the 
corresponding West or East undefined posistion on the slip.  When the turnout is
dropped on to the lebel, it will display the turnout name.

<H3>Single Slip</H3>
<img src="images/SingleSlip.png" align="right">
<p>The Single Slip works in very much the same way as the Double Slip in that it 
requires a pair of turnouts to be selected for the West and East side of the Slip.
However it has a further option, which is to select which way the slip routes.</p>
<img src="images/SingleOptions.png"> 
<p>Use the radio button to select if the slip takes the upper or lower route, making 
the change will automatically change the icon in the slip position to suit.

<H3>Three Way Turnout</H3>
<img src="images/ThreeWay.png" align="right">
<p>With the Three Way Turnout, you require a pair of turnouts, one for the first 
throat, then another for the second.</p>
<img src="images/ThreeWayOptions.png"> 
<p>You also need to determine which exit the first throat turnout relates to.

<H3>Scissor (Double) Crossing</H3>
<p>The Scissor crossing can use either a pair of turnout address with diagonally 
opposite turnouts being wired together as one.  Or it can use four turnout 
addresses, one for each corner of the scissor.
<p><b>Note : </b>The Scissor Crossing Icon does not allow for all routes to be set 
as crossing, this mainly due to the fact that in many instance setting a scissor
crossing to this state will cause a short circuit.
<img src="images/ScissorBy2.png" align="right">
<p>When a pair of turnouts is used, you place the turnout that is controlling the 
Upper West to Lower East route into the Right Hand Crossing panel, and the 
turnout address controlling the Lower West to Upper East route into the Left Hand
Crossing Panel.
<img src="images/ScissorBy4.png" align="right">
<p>When four turnouts are used, you need to place the four turnouts from the 
turnout table to the corresponding locations in the panel.
