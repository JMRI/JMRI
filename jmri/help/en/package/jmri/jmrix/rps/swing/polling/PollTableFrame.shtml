JMRI: RPS Polling Control

The RPS Polling Control window is where you tell the 
<a href="../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/index.shtml">RPS system</a> 
which of your locomotives have RPS transmitters 
installed, and how often to talk to them.

<p>
When you open the window, you should see your entire
<a href="../../../../../../manual/Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">roster of locomotives</a>
displayed, one per line.

<p>
If a locomotive has a RPS transmitter installed and you'd like the 
system to track its position, check the box in the "Poll" column.

<p>
To control whether the system as a whole is polling, check or uncheck
the "Poll" box in the bottom section of the window.

<p>
The table has nine columns:
<ul>
<li>"Roster Name" - This is the locomotive decoder name from the roster.
<li>"ID" - The name that RPS uses to refer to this transmitter.  By default,
it's the same as the roster name, but you can change it if you'd like.
<li>"Locomotive Address" and "Long" - The DCC address of the decoder.
The "Long" box will be checked if this is a "long" ("extended") address.
<li>"Polled" - Should the RPS system measure this position?
<li>"Last X", "Last Y", "Last Z" - The most recent measured position for this transmitter.
<li>"Last Time" - The time the last measurement was taken.
</UL>

There are three radio buttons that control how polling is done.
<dl>
<dt>Use BSC Poll
<dd>When checked, this uses a "Binary State Command" to poll the RPS system.
If your RPS transmitters support this, it is the recommended setting except
for with Lenz systems.
<dt>Use Direct Poll
<dd>When checked, JMRI sends F2 commands directly on the track.  
Use this if your RPS transmitters require F2 polls, and you don't
have a Lenz DCC system.
<dt>Use Throttle Poll
<dd>When checked, JMRI simulates a throttle to send F2 polls.  This
is currently required for Lenz systems, and not recommended for others.
</dl>

<p>
The interval box controls the number of milliseconds between polls.
This should not be set below about 80.  If you are polling
less than 5 transmitters, set it to 300 or above.
This option will eventually be removed
in a later JMRI version, when it becomes automatic.
<p>
To save the values so they'll be automatically used
when the program is next started, click "Store New Default Values".
