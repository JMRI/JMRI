<h3>What are Sensors?</h3>

<p>
A Sensor is JMRI's way of representing an input from the layout.
<P>
JMRI uses a Sensor to represent the status of a block occupancy detector,
or a pushbutton on the fascia, or just about anything else you can attach
to an input on your DCC or C/MRI system.

<h3>Controlling a Sensor</h3>

<p>
Generally, you don't control the state of a Sensor object; JMRI, working with the
hardware on your layout, does.  

<P>
But there are some occasions where you might like to locally change the state
of a Sensor:  To debug some logic that uses the Sensor as an input, etc.  It can
be very convenient to temporarily change how a sensor is set without having to 
run out to the layout and push a button or put a locomotive in a block.

<P>
Therefore, we let you locally change a sensor via the Sensor Table (see below), or 
by clicking on a sensor icon on a panel (See the 
<A HREF="../apps/PanelPro/PanelPro.shtml">PanelPro pages</a> 
for more info on panels).

<P>
The change takes effect immediately, unless a debounce timer is configured see below,
but only lasts until the next time you change it in the program, or the next time the 
input hardware on the layout changes the value.
<H3><A NAME="Debounce"></A>Sensor Debounce</H2>
<p>The Sensor Debounce facility is there to help prevent false triggers of a sensor
being passed into the system and triggering other events in the system.<br>
Such false triggers could be due to a dirty piece of track or electrical interferance.

<p>The facility allows you to assign a period in miliseconds before the change
is registered with the rest of the system.  If after that period the state has
not changed then the sensor state will be passed onto the rest the of the system.<br>
    
However if the sensors state is different after the timer has finished, then the 
system will restart the process, this time after the timer has finished it will
check to see if the sensor state is in the same state as it was before it restarted 
the process.  If not the process is re-started again until the state is the same
before and after the timer is run.   
<h3>Saving Sensor configuration to disk</h3>

<p>Sensors are saved in your layout configuration file, along with turnouts, 
lights, signal heads, etc.  To store this information on disk, use <b>Store 
Configuration...</b> in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Light 
Table (or other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b>
in the <b>Panel</b> menu. 

<a name="add"><H3>Adding a new Sensor</H3></a>
<p>To create a new Sensor, follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Click 
<a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml"><b>Sensor Table</b></a>
in the <b>Tools</b> menu to bring up
the Sensor Table, and click the 
<a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorAddEdit.shtml"><b>Add...</b></a>
button at the bottom of the 
table to bring up the Add/Edit Sensor window.</p>
	<li><p>From the <b>System</b> drop down list select the system to which the 
    sensor is connected to.  In the <b>Hardware Address</b> enter in the
    <a href="../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#systeminfo">hardware address of the input connection</a> 
    being referenced.<br>The format of the Hardware Address can often be made in 
    the format of "board:channel" or "Cab Address:Pin", you will need to confirm 
    the specifics of each system using the following <a href="../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#systeminfo">link</a>
    
	</li>
	<li><p>Enter a user name. Any string of characters that is different 
from the user name of other Sensors will be accepted, but it's 
wise to use a string that describes the intended use of the Sensor.
You can leave this blank if you'd like.</p>
	</li>
    
    <li><p>If you wish to add a number of sensors at once, click on the 
    <b>Add a Range</b> checkbox and then in the <b>Number to Add</b> field enter
    in the number of sensors that you wish to add.  If you have entered a user
    name, then this will be appended with a number to ensure that each user name
    is unique.  If a hardware address already exists in the block that is being
    added, then the system will skip that address and will carry on.
    </li>

	<li><p>Click the <b>OK</b> button at the bottom of the window.  
If everything is fine, a message stating "New Sensor added ... " will be 
displayed in the notes area. If there is trouble with anything, an error or 
warning message will be displayed in the notes area; you should then
correct the error and click <b>OK</b> again.</p>
    </li>
    <LI><P>Back in the main Sensor Table, you can then see the current
    status of the Sensor.
</ol>
