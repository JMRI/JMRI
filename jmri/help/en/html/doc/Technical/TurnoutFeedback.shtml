<H1>JMRI: Turnout Feedback</H1>

Model railroaders  want different things when it comes to knowing the 
status of the turnouts on their layout.  Some are quite happy
to say "I told it to move, that's good enough for me".  
These people don't worry about whether a turnout 
on their layout actually moved when they told it to.  Those people
can just ignore this page, and leave the JMRI settings at their 
default.

<P>
But some modelers want to have better information about the
status of the turnouts on their layout, and so use
some form of "feedback" to indicate turnout position.  This could be
as complicated as two microswitches, adjusted to only close when the
turnout is properly seated in either position.  Or it could be something
simpler.

<P>
In the code, Turnout objects actually know about two different 
states:  "Commanded" state and "Known" state.  The commanded state is "This is 
what was asked for last".  The known state is "This is what's 
actually correct on the layout as far as I know".

<P>Built into into LocoNet and XPressNet are limited abilities to monitor what is happening on their
    networks and adapt to messages about Turnout state changes. The NCE Powerhouse Pro can provide
    the last known state of a turnout that was changed by a cab or macro. All the other protocols
    normally use a "you told it to change, so it did" logic. In other words, when something in the
    code (the Turnout Tool or a script) commands a state change from closed to thrown, the default
    is for both both the commanded state and the known state to change to "thrown".</P>
    
    <P>
But it is also possible to control this in more detail if you have 
wired your layout to allow it.

<P>
The whole question of turnout feedback is then "How do we configure
the program to understand the known state properly, given my
layout hardware?"

<P>
If you go to the <A HREF="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table</A> tool, you'll find it has four columns
associated with feedback:
<DL>
<DT>"Feedback"</DT><DD>This is the "known state".  You can't change it, but this 
column will show you what the program thinks it is.</DD>

<DT>"Mode"</DT><DD>This is the feedback method used by this turnout.  (You can 
change it for each turnout individually, but note the change doesn't 
take effect until you click somewhere else, and you might need to add 
some sensor names in the next column(s))</DD>

<DT>"Sensor 1", "Sensor 2"</DT><DD>These define the sensors needed by certain 
types of feedback. You can type a sensor number, system name or user 
name here; the program will change it to the system name that it 
needs.</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Available feedback modes are:
<DL>
<DT>DIRECT</DT><DD>The default in many cases, and also the original behavior
of the program.  When something 
tells the turnout to change, it's just immediately assumed that it 
actually did it.</DD>

<DT>ONESENSOR</DT><DD>The turnout watches the sensor defined by the "Sensor 1" 
column, which is probably hooked to a microswitch on the turnout or 
similar.  When the sensor is Active, the turnout is known to be in 
the "Thrown" position.  When it's Inactive, the turnout is known to 
be in the "Closed" position.</DD>

<DT>TWOSENSOR</DT><DD>The turnout watches two sensors defined by the "Sensor 1" 
and "Sensor 2" columns, which are probably hooked to microswitches at 
either end of the turnout's throw bar. When Sensor 1 is active, the 
turnout is known to be thrown.  When Sensor 2 is active, the turnout 
is known to be closed (normal).</DD>

<DT>MONITORING</DT><DD>Default for LocoNet and XPressNet turnouts, and available for NCE,
this means the network is monitored for messages about the 
status of the turnout.  This mode is only available for certain 
protocols, i.e. some protocols can't do the monitoring properly, 
and don't have this choice.</DD>

<DT>INDIRECT</DT><DD>Currently only available for LocoNet 
turnouts, this informs the program that the turnout is 
being driven by a Digitrax DS54 with a microswitch attached 
to the switch lead.  For more information, see the
<A HREF="../../hardware/loconet/DS54.shtml">DS54 page</a>.</DD>

<DT>EXACT</DT><DD>Currently only available for LocoNet and XPressNet 
turnouts.  For LocoNet turnouts, this informs the program that the turnout is
being driven by a Digitrax DS54 with two microswitches attached
to the switch and aux leads.  For more information, see the
<A HREF="../../hardware/loconet/DS54.shtml">DS54 page</a>. For XPressNet turnouts, this informs the program that the turnout is being driven by an LS100 and te feedback inputs have been connected as described in the <a href="http://www.lenz.com/manuals/accessorydecoders/ls100110.pdf">LS100 manual (external link, PDF)</a>.</DD>

</DL>

<P>Most people will (and probably should!!!) stick with the default 
feedback type that the software selects for them.

<h2>Operation</h2>

When feedback is used, Turnouts can start to behave in complicated ways.

<h3>Simplest Case</h3>
The most common case is JMRI commanding turnouts to move, and they move properly.
The sequence is then:
<ol>
<li>JMRI commands the Turnout to move by setting the commanded state to e.g. THROWN.
<li>The Turnout object figures out the right commands to send to the layout hardware, 
and works with the rest of the program to do that.
<li>The position changes on the layout.
</ol>

If no feedback (really, DIRECT feedback) is in use, the 
known state of the turnout will also change in step 1.  At that point,
icons on panels, signal logic, etc will all be notified of the change and react.

<h3>Simple Layout Feedback</h3>

The simplest case for using feedback from a microswitch on the layout is similar:

<ol>
<li>JMRI commands the Turnout to move by setting the commanded state to e.g. THROWN.
<li>The Turnout object figures out the right commands to send to the layout hardware, 
and works with the rest of the program to do that.
<li>The position changes on the layout.
<li>A microswitch detects that position change, and informs the layout electronics, 
which in turn changes an input to JMRI.
<li>That input is connected to a JMRI Sensor object, which changes its state
e.g. from INACTIVE to ACTIVE.
<li>Because the Turnout is watching that Sensor for ONESENSOR feedback, when the 
change occurs it sets the known state of the turnout to THROWN.
</ol>

This sequence takes a little time, but the known state of the 
Turnout isn't changed until the points have actually moved on the layout.
Then, icons on panels, signal logic, etc will all be notified of the change 
in known state and react.

<h3>Uncommanded changes on the layout</h3>

Feedback allows JMRI to detect that something has changed
due to action on the layout, instead of a command from the program.
For example, if you're using feedback from a turnout, you might see
something like this sequence:
<ol>
<li>The program sets the commanded state to THROWN, and
instructions go out to the turnout telling it to move to that position.
<li>Later, the feedback information comes back to indicate that the
movement has taken place.  This sets the known state in JMRI 
to THROWN.
<li>Later, and independently, you move the turnout on the layout to the CLOSED position, 
perhaps with a ground throw or local pushbutton.
<li>This causes the feedback information send to JMRI to change.
<li>Because of this, the known state is changed to CLOSED.
<li>At this point, JMRI makes the assumption that 
you wanted this to happen; in effect, a command was given on the layout
(not in the program) to move the turnout.  So JMRI changes the 
commanded state to CLOSED also.
</ul>

Note that this last transition in commanded state does not send commands to
the layout; it's just a change within in the program.
