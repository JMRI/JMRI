<h1>JMRI: Plug-in mechanisms</h1>

The original goal of the JMRI project was to produce a library upon which people
could use to build their own applications.  Although some people do that, more
use the existing applications such as DecoderPro and PanelPro. 
We want to make this more flexible by providing a way to extend
those programs without having to rebuild them from scratch.  This note describes
mechanisms for that which will is included in JMRI 2.4 and later.

<OL>

<LI>CLASSPATH
<P>
DecoderPro et al are run via a java command which sets the CLASSPATH and
various options.  How that's actually done varies with the platform:  csh
scripts on Unix, a 
<a href="StartUpScripts.shtml#windows">launcher application</a>
on Windows, application bundles on Mac OS X, etc.
<P>
To make it easy to add plug-ins, these include all .jar files in the 
application directory, and in its "lib/" subdirectory, in the CLASSPATH.
<P>
If you create a jar file including your code, it will automatically
be found. You can also put your classes in the "classes" directory of the
startup directory, which is searched first.
<p>
For more information, see the 
<a href="StartUpScripts.shtml">page on startup scripts</a>.

<LI>Replacement of existing classes
<P>
Note that you can directly replace any of the files in the jmri.jar distribution
with your own versions by putting them in a jar file that's searched first.  
For example, including a modified version of a .properties file 
would allow you to include customized versions of menu 
strings.  This can also be done with a .class file, for example changing 
the order of menu items by replacing the DecoderPro class.


<LI>Plugin classes
<P>
Replacing a class can cause extra work in the long term, as the replaced
class may be modified as JMRI evolves.  So we also provide a hook on which
to hang new code.  After initialization is complete, the programs will
attempt to invoke a static member of the form:
<PRE>

  package jmri;
  public class JmriPlugin {
     public static void start(javax.swing.JFrame mainFrame, javax.swing.JMenuBar menuBar) {}
  }

</PRE>
This method
can modify the menubar by inserting, modifying or removing menus or menu
items, add buttons to the main panel, etc.  
<p>
As people use this capability, we'll probably want to refactor some existing
classes to make them easier to extend. For example, a monolithic formatting
class like llnmon should be broken up into smaller pieces to make it easier
to add new formats.

</OL>

<h2>Other Mechanisms</h2>

It's also possible to customize your version of JMRI using 
scripts, and by using the 
<a href="../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">advanced preferences</a>.

<p>
Scripts can locate and access any open window, for example.
The
<a href="http://jmri.org/jython/AddButton.py">AddButton.py</a> 
sample script is an example of adding a script button to the main window.
The
<a href="http://jmri.org/jython/DisableOpsMode.py">DisableOpsMode.py</a> 
sample script shows how how to modify the main window to remove the ops-mode
programming button.
The
<a href="http://jmri.org/jython/ReporterFontControl.py">ReporterFontControl.py</a> 
sample script is an even more advanced example that 
changes the appearance of items on panel screens.
