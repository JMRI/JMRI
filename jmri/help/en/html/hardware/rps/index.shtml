<h1> 
JMRI Hardware Guide: NAC Services RPS
</h1>

<em>Please note that JMRI's RPS support is being rapidly improved.
This page refers to most recent JMRI test version.  If you're using
an RPS system, you should update to new test versions as they 
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/download/index.shtml">are announced</a>.</em>

<p>
The 
<a href="http://www.proto87.com/RPS-MR-position-detection-system.html">RPS System</a>
allows you to locate the 
exact position of locomotives and other rolling stock
that have been equipped with transmitter decoders.
The system makes up to 10 measurements per second and each
reading is accurate to much better than an inch, which
makes many imaginative uses possible.

<h2>Supported DCC Systems</h2>

The RPS system works in conjunction which your DCC system
to control when the RPS transmitters are activated.
You therefore need a working connection between your DCC
system and JMRI to use RPS.
<p>
At the present time, RPS is supported with DCC systems from:
<ul>
    <LI>Digitrax
    <LI>Lenz
    <li>NCE
</ul>
Others may work, and we're interested in making them work, but they
haven't been tested in combination with RPS yet.
      
<h2>System Setup</h2>
First, get your DCC system working and connected to JMRI.
As a good test of the connection, you should be able to turn 
your layout power on and off from the JMRI Power Control in the Tools menu.

<p>Next set up the RPS hardware following the RPS instructions.
You may want to only install a few (but a minimum of three) 
receivers while you're first getting the system working.
<p>
Next, connect your computer to the RPS using either a USB connection
or an RS232 cable from a serial port.
If you use an RS232 cable, not that it should be a "straight-through"
or "modem" cable, <I>not</I> a "crossover" or "null-modem" cable.

<P>
Next, configure the JMRI program.
<UL>
  <LI>Start your JMRI-based program (DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc).
  <li> Go to the preferences panel of the program.
  This opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you
  can select it from the "Edit" menu.

  <li>Your DCC connection should already be configured
  in the top section, see above.
  
  <li>Click "Show advanced preferences" to open a new 
  part of the preferences window.
  
  <li>Select "RPS Base Station" from the "Aux connection 2"
  selection box.
  
  <LI>In the associated port selection box, pick the name of the 
  serial port that you have connected to the RPS system.

  <li>The baud rate will show a fixed value of
  115200 baud.

  <li>As a temporary measure during development of the system,
  there's a "Protocol" option to select.  The valid
  choices are "Version 1" and "Version 2"; your hardware determines which
  to use. Most current RPS systems use "Version 2".
  This selection will eventually be automated.
  
  <li>Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
  quit, click "Yes".

  <li> Restart the program. It should come up saying it's connected
  to your DCC system, and just below that saying it's connected to
  the RPS Base Station on the proper port. 
  
  <li>Next, you have to enter alignment information.
  From the RPS menu, select 
  "<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/aligntable/AlignTableFrame.shtml">Receiver Control</a>".
  This will open a new window.  
  
  <li>In the middle of that window, enter the number of
  highest-numbered receiver you've got.
  For example, if you have three receivers numbered 2, 3 and 6, 
  enter 6 in the field.
  Press the "Set" button next to that field.
  
  <li>In the table at the top, enter the X, Y and Z position of
  each of your receivers.  If you don't have a 
  receiver with a particular number, leave that row blank.
  For now, just enter approximate values.
  
  <li>Check the boxes next to each receiver you have hooked up,
  and make sure that there's no box checked next for receiver numbers
  that are not yet connected.
  
  <li>Click the "Set Defaults" button to save these positions as default values.
  They'll appear again when you next start the program.
</ul>

At this point, your RPS system is ready to go.
<p>
To have your RPS system start measuring positions, you have to
tell it to poll the locomotives in which you've installed 
RPS transmitters. To do this:
<ul>
    <li>Open the 
    "<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/swing/polling/PollTableFrame.shtml">Polling Control</a>"
    from the RPS menu
    <li>You should see all of the locomotives in your roster
    <li>Check the box under "Poll" for each 
        locomotive in which a RPS transmitted is installed
    <li>Check the "poll" box to start making measurements
    <li>Click "Store New Default Values" to store these settings so
        they'll be used the next time you start the program.
</ul>

<p>
To see that the system is working, open the 
"<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/swing/debugger/DebuggerFrame.shtml">Debugging Display</a>"
from the RPS menu.  You should see time readings coming
in and being converted to positions.  You can also check the
communications with the unit by opening the "RPS Monitor"
from the RPS menu.

<h2>RPS Tools</h2>

JMRI provides a number of tools in the RPS menu for 
working with the RPS system:
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/aligntable/AlignTableFrame.shtml">Receiver Control</a>
<dd>This is where you enter position information about your receiver
positions, etc.

<dt><a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/swing/polling/PollTableFrame.shtml">Polling Control</a>
<dd>This is where you tell JMRI which locomotives have RPS 
transmitters, and how often you want JMRI to poll them

<dt><a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/swing/debugger/DebuggerFrame.shtml">Debug Display</a>
<dd>This shows you the readings and measurements as the system makes them

<dt><a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/trackingpanel/RpsTrackingFrame.shtml">Tracking Display</a>
<dd>This shows the points as they are measured on a graphical display.

<dt><a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/swing/soundset/SoundSetFrame.shtml">Sound Speed Control</a>
<dd>This lets you see and set the speed of sound used by the RPS system, and can set it automatically
in certain cases.

</dl>

You can also display RPS information on PanelPro control panels using an
"<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/RpsIcon.shtml">RPS Icon</a>".
<p>
RPS information may be used to detect occupancy using 
<a href="sensors.shtml">JMRI RPS Sensors</a>.
