      JMRI Hardware Guide: Connecting a LocoBuffer-II to LocoNet&reg;
      </h1>


<p>
The LocoBuffer-II provides a very reliable way to 
connect a computer serial port to a LocoNet&reg;.  
It was produced by Dick Bronson's
<A HREF="http://www.rr-cirkits.com">RR-CirKits</a> 
company, based in part on the original LocoBuffer design, but is
currently out of production.  You might be able to find one
in a local hobby shop.  It's been replaced
by the 
<A HREF="LocoBufferUSB.shtml">LocoBuffer-USB</a>,
which uses a USB connection.
</p>

<h2>Recommended setup</h2>
<p>
    The recommended LocoBuffer-II option switch settings are:</p>
<ul>
    <LI>19,200 baud or 57,600 baud</LI>
    <LI>RS-232 echo off</LI>
    <LI>LocoBuffer mode</LI>
    <LI>ICSP Program Mode off</LI>
    <LI>Boot Program Mode off</LI>
    <LI>Isolated power (<a href="#locoBufferIIPower">see below</a>)</LI>
</ul>
    
<p>The recommended JMRI setup for the LocoBuffer-II is:
</p>

<UL>
<LI>Set all switches off (toward the front label side).
<LI>Connect the LocoBuffer-II to a suitable power supply, for example
a wall-wart of the correct voltage.
<LI>
Start DecoderPro or other program and configure it for:
<UL>
<LI>LocoNet LocoBuffer-II
<LI>Select your port
<LI>19,200 baud or 57,600 baud, to match the LocoBuffer-II internal option switch settings
<LI>Hardware flow control
</UL>
</UL>

<h2>Loop-back testing</h2>
<p>
The LocoBuffer-II input circuit and code actually reads from the LocoNet 
output jack, so if you install the LocoNet terminator 
(the small circuit that was shipped with the LocoBuffer-II) 
and set SW7-8 to 
ON (down) so that the input circuitry gets it's power from the 
wall-wart, then you have created a loop back test. The only thing that is not 
tested is the LocoNet jack itself.
</p>


<p>
Steps:
<OL>
<LI>Unplug The LocoNet cable
<LI>Open case (use a small screw driver to work open the latches at the small slots on the sides)
<LI>Install terminator
<LI>Set Sw 7-8 ON, all other switches OFF
<LI>Set the JMRI LocoBuffer options to 19,200 baud and hardware 
handshaking enabled
<LI>Open the JMRI LocoNet Monitor window.
<LI>Using JMRI send some commands (e.g. switch commands)
<LI>The commands should appear in the LocoNet monitor window and the 
LocoBuffer-II activity LED should blink
<li>Remove the terminator (unless your application requires it)
<LI>Restore the LocoBuffer-II option switches to their normal settings for your application
</OL>

<h2><a name="locoBufferIIPower">LocoBuffer-II Power</a></h2>

When powered by an external supply, the LocoBuffer-II completely
isolates your computer from the LocoNet, removing the possibility
of ground currents flowing through the LocoNet cable.
<P>
If you are using an isolated computer, for example a laptop that's
not connected to any peripherals, you can configure the LocoBuffer-II
for "Local Power" so that it doesn't need an external power supply. It 
will then get it's power from the RailSync leads in the LocoNet.
<P>
It is strongly advised that you get your computer connection working
properly with an external power source in "Isolated Power" mode before 
you do this.  That way, if any problems arise when you try to use 
Internal Power, you'll know what caused them and they'll be much 
easier to diagnose.
<P>
To configure the LocoBuffer-II for "Local Power", remove the power 
connection and set switches 7 and 8 to ON (down, toward the switch 
illustration).
