<h1> 
JMRI: Quantum Programmer
</h1>

JMRI can now use a Quantum Programmer module
to read and write CVs in DCC decoders.

<p>
JMRI cannot (yet) download sounds to QSI decoders.

<p>
Note that when using JMRI with the Quantum Programmer,
the Quantum CV Manager program must <em>not</em>
be running. If it is, you'll get obscure errors and JMRI won't be
able to access the decoder.

<p>
JMRI and the Quantum program generally works well with QSI
decoders.  Some people have had trouble using JMRI and the
Quantum Programmer with non-QSI decoders, particularly other
kinds of sound decoders.  In those cases, the solution has
usually been to use a programming track booster
such as the 
<a href="http://www.tonystrains.com/technews/powerpax.htm">PowerPax</a>
or
<a href="http://www.soundtraxx.com/access/ptb100.php">PTB-100<a>.




<h2>Driver Installation</h2>

To access the Quantum Programmer, you need to install a driver on your
computer.  This section describes how to do that for several popular
computer types.

<a id="driverWin">
<h3>Windows</h3>

For JMRI to talk to the Quantum Programmer, a driver has to be installed
so that the Quantum Programmer appears to be a serial port (a Virtual Comm Port, or
VCP).  These drivers are compatible with the most recent version of the
QSI Quantum Programmer software, so you can alternate between
using JMRI and the Quantum Programmer (though not at the same time, of course).

<p>
Max Ettinger has provided 
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/install/qsidriver/">detailed instructions</a>
for how to install these.  

<a id="driverMac">
<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the 
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/corby-osx-V1_04_1-release.dmg">installation file</a>
for the Mac OS X driver.
This is a disk image (.dmg) file that should open
as a new Finder window. If not, double click on it.
<li>
Double-click on the installer and follow the directions.
<li>
Restart your computer.
</ol>
You should now be able to start a JMRI application
and access the Quantum Programmer.  It will appear as
"Quantum Programmer" in the preferences windows.

<a id="driverLinux">
<h3>Linux</h3>

<em>This is still being worked on.</em>

<ol>
<li>Download the 
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/cornwall-redhat9-V0_84.tar">installation file</a>
for the Linux driver.
This is a .tar archive file.
<li>
Expand the archive to somewhere convenient, and change directory to there.
<li>
Try running the installer via either
<code><pre>
./load_qsi_prog
</pre></code>
or
<code><pre>
sudo ./load_qsi_prog
</pre></code>
</ol>

<h2>Configure the Quantum Programmer Support</h2>

You configure JMRI to use a Quantum Programmer similarly to the
way all other connection types are configured.

<ol>
<li>
Start the program
<li>
Select the "Preferences..." item from the "Edit" menu on the main window.
<li>
Select "Quantum Programmer" as the connection type.
<li>
Select "QSIProgrammer" as the port to use.
<li>
The rest of the options are fixed, and can't be changed.
<li>
Click the "Save" button. When prompted, allow the program to quit.
</ol>

The program is now configured. Restart it, and it should be ready to use.

<h2>Features and Limitations</h2>

The Quantum Programmer hardware is capable of driving one (low-current) locomotive
in "Ops Mode".  This lets the user run the engine, test the lights, etc.
JMRI does not yet have code to do this, but if there's enough interest we can certainly
add it.

<p>
We currently don't have enough information to download sounds to the decoder through 
the Quantum Programmer.  If we get the information, we'll certainly write this code.
