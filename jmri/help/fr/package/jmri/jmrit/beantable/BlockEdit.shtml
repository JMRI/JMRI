<h1>Edit Block Window</h1>
This edit window allows you to edit the following areas.<br>
<a href="#basic">Basic</a><br>
<a href="#sensor">Sensor</a><br>
<a href="#reporter">Reporter</a><br>
<a href="#properties">Properties</a>

<a name="basic"><h2>Basic</h2></a>
This provides basic information on the details of the block
<ul>
<li><p><b>System Name</b> - The system name of the Block. There is no functional 
requirement for a type letter in the System Name of a Block, but by convention we use 
'B' for 'Block'. The default implementation is not system-specific, so a system letter 
of 'I' is appropriate. This leads to system names like "IB201".</p></li> 

<li><p><b>User Name</b> - The user name of the Block. The user name of a Block created
here may be set to any text.  The user name for a Block created by Layout Editor is 
set by Layout Editor and should not be changed.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Comment</b> - You may enter any text in this field that will help you 
distinguish this Block from other Blocks, or provide useful notes about its use.</p></li></ul>

<a name="sensor"><h2>Sensor</h2></a>
This tabs allows you to assign a sensor to the block to change the occupancy state, it
also allows certain information about the sensor to be changed.

<ul><li><p><b>Sensor</b>
Select the sensor from the drop down list that will be assoicated with this block.</li>

You can edit the sensor debounce options from this tab, setting the Sensor Debounce 
helps to prevent false triggers of a sensor being passed into the system and triggering 
other events in the system.<br>
Such false triggers could be due to a dirty piece of track or electrical interferance.
<li><b>Use Global Debounce Values</b> check box, allows you to select if the sensor will
 use the default sensor debounce values if configured.<br></li>
<li><b>Sensor Inactive Debounce</b> and <b>Sensor Active Debounce</b> allow you to 
specify the amount of time in milliSeconds that the system waits before registering 
the state change of a sensor.</li></ul>

<a name="reporter"><h2>Reporter</h2></a>
<ul><li><p><b>Reporter</b>
The Reporter assigned to this block. See the Reporter table. Puts the Reporter Value into 
the Block value

<li><p><b>Use Current?</b>
If we consider the scenario whereby we want track a train around the layout, typically this 
is achieved via the use of Memory objects associated with Blocks. Until the train is known, we 
have nothing to track. Typically, we can manually type in the train ID into a panel and then 
this is tracked around the layout based on block occupancy. If, however, we have an attached 
device that can provide us with the train ID, such as an RFID reader, we no longer need to 
manually type the train ID in - the reader does this for us. In essence, the reader is little 
more than an 'intelligent' sensor - not only can it sense that 'something' is there, it can 
tell us which something it is.
Now to the implementation.
A Sensor is purely ACTIVE or INACTIVE - i.e. something is there or it isn't.
A Reporter, however, can tell us one of the following:
<ol>
<li>'Hey, I'm seeing something right now - this is it'
<li>'Hmm, I'm not seeing anything right now'
<li>'Hey, I saw something a while back - this was it'
<li>'Hmm, I've not seen anything yet'
</ol>
The first two are from the CurrentReport; the last two from LastReport.
At start-up (assuming there is nothing within the range of the reader), both 2 and 4 are the initial 
state. Once something is seen, both 1 and 3 return the same result. 
When the something is 'out-of-range' 2 and 3 are then active.
With 'Use Current?' selected the Block value will switch between 1 and 2, 
whereas with 'Use Current?' unselected the Block value will switch between 3 and 4.</li></ul>

<a name="properties"><h2>Properties</h2></a>

<ul><li><p><b>Length</b> (optional) - Displays the length of the Block.  Optionally, you may 
enter the length of the Block here.  The length is used for automatic running of trains. 
If '0.0' is displayed, the length has not been entered. The entered length should be the 
actual length of the Block on the model railroad layout. Length is entered and displayed 
in either inches or centimeters, depending on which unit is requested at the bottom of 
the Block Table.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Curvature</b> (optional) - Displays the curvature selected for the track in 
the Block. Curvature is used for automatic running of trains, and need not be entered 
if trains will not be run automatically. Curvature, if present, indicates to the computer 
that it should slow the train as it runs through the Block. If <b>None</b> or 
<b>Gradual</b> are selected, an automatic train will proceed at normal speed. <b>Tight</b> 
should be selected if the train should slow down some; <b>Severe </b>should be selected 
if the train should slow by a maximum amount. If the Block has variable curvature, your 
selection should be made according to the most limiting part of the Block.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Speed</b>
The speed is used with certain automation tools and logic, to help
determine the speed at which a train can be set through the block.
It is also used by the signal mast logic for determining which aspect should
be displayed in a signal path.
<P>In the drop down list, you are presented a set of named fixed speeds that
have been predefined in the signalSpeed.xml file, in addition to a global option.  
<br>It is also possible to enter in a numerical value to represent a speed.
<p>The global value is set via the <b>Speeds</b> menu option.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Permissive</b>
The permissive option is used to identify blocks that can be entered while the 
block is occupied.  It is used with certain automation tools and logic, to help
determine if a train can enter an occupied block and what aspect should be displayed
on a signal mast.</li></ul>
