# How we build and release JMRI distributions
[Online version](https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/scripts/HOWTO-distribution.md)

In SVN, we used "branches" to record the contents of a release. The "Release-4-1-1" branch was used to accumulate the content of that release, and then finally to record that content. In CVS, we'd used tags to record the content of a release, but SVN "tag" and "branch" constructs don't really differ.

Git branches are more ephemeral than SVN branches. They're great for development work, but aren't considered a good way to record content.  Git tags, on the other hand, are great for that.

So our releases procedure is, in outline:

* Create a GitHub Issue to hold discussion with conventional title "Develop release-n.n.n". 

* Do lots of updates and merge completely onto master

* In an up-to-date Git repository, update the release.properties file with the new version number

* Create a branch named "release-n.n.n" (note initial lower case). 

* Push the branch back to the JMRI/JMRI repository (you can't use a pull request until the branch exists), then switch back to master so you don't accidentally change the release branch

* Jenkins build from release-n.n.n branch.  (That’s basically the same Jenkins job, except for changing to checkout from Github)

* As needed, bring in any additional commits requested to branch from master - probably use 'git cherry-pick {commit hash}' to do this. Sometimes also “git merge”, though we’ll have to see exactly how “release.properties” works with this. With SVN, we sometimes created the release a few days in advance to make sure Jenkins was set up, etc, then do final “svn merge” at the appointed time; we might also do this from GitHub. When using 'git merge' would also work we need to be aware of it stamping over 'release.properties'  and the correct procedure to revert that. 

* After Jenkins has processed the final set of changes, directly publish the files in the usual SF.net way, etc.

* We're also looking at using GitHub releases for distributing the files; this is being done in parallel, so the SF.net file method will co-exist at first.

* Turn off the Jenkins job; this is so it doesn't fail after later steps

* Put a tag titled vn.n.n (note initial lower case) on the end of the branch. This starts in a personal fork, then gets pushed back to JMRI/JMRI. 

* Delete the branch (to clean up the list of branches in various GUI tools), which can be done in the main JMRI/JMRI repo via the web interface or in a fork & pushed back


### Issues

- [ ] Are we using [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones)?  How? Only maintainers can set them on pull requests. The list is being referenced in the release note now. Do we have the release builder add milestones on [closed PRs](https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)?

- [ ] How best to deal with bringing additional commits into the branch from master - do we 'cherry-pick' or 'merge'? Everybody is using pull requests, which makes it pretty easy to get the hash numbers needed for cherry-pick (that can be messy with direct commits, because you’re not always sure which commits go together). We can play this by ear, but if somebody says “can you include PR 123?” I think that lends itself to a cherry pick pretty nicely. Best of all - get people to do their work on a branch, which can be separately merged.

- [ ] It might be a good idea to keep the production release branches around throughout the next test phases, but we should be able to prune each test release branch once we've tagged it. So, we'd keep the 4.0 (and 4.0.1) branch around throughout the 4.1.x phase and then prune it when moving to 4.2. Each 4.1.x branch should be pruned once tagged as, if we need to do changes to a test release, we just release a new version on it's own branch from 'master’. How about the case near the end of a development cycle when we’re doing incremental releases? E.g. 4.1.9 might be 4.1.8+deltas?  Should that be a branch from a branch? We'll need to develop and document this as needed.

============================================================================

# Detailed Instructions

The Ant task that handles the Git operations (see below) invokes Git via direct command line execution. This means that you need to have a working command-line git tool installed and configured.  Try "git status" to check.  

People building releases for distribution need permission to directly operate with the JMRI/JMRI GitHub repository.

If you're attempting to perform this on MS Windows, refer to the MS Windows notes section at the bottom of this document.

================================================================================
## Notification

- Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues) to hold discussion with conventional title "Create release-n.n.n". 


================================================================================
## Update Content

- Go to the master branch on your local repository. Pull back from the main JMRI/JMRI repository to make sure you're up to date.

- If it's a new year, update copyright dates (done for 2015):

    * build.xml (3) in the jmri.copyright.years property value
    * site/Copyright.html (3 places)
    * xml/XSLT/build.xml in the property value, index.html, CSVindex.html
    * (grep -r for the previous year in the web site, xml; don't change copyright notices!)

- Bring in all possible GitHub JMRI/JMRI [pull requests](https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pulls)

- [ ] Do we want to add a step about the use of milestones here?  If we're using them, we should make sure that all closed pull requests have the right one(s) set.

- Bring in all possible [sf.net patches](https://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/patches/), including decoders

- Check if the decoder definitions have changed since the previous release (almost always true) If so, remake the decoder index.

        ant remakedecoderindex

(Check 'session.log' and 'messages.log' located in current directory as, in case of errors they might not always be output to the console)

        git diff xml/decoderIndex.xml
        git commit -m"update decoder index" xml/decoderIndex.xml

- Update the help/en/Acknowledgements.shtml help page with any recent changes

- Commit any changes in your local web site directory, as these can end up in help, xml, etc (See the JMRI page on local web sites for details)

- Remake the help index (need a command line approach, so can put in ant!)

    cd help/en/
    rm ~/.jhelpdev    (to make sure the right preferences are chosen)
    ./JHelpDev.csh   (See the doc page for setup) <-- for Windows, use JHelpDev.bat
    (navigate to JHelpDev.xml in release html/en/ & open it; might take a while)
    (click "Create All", takes a bit of time, wait for button to release)
    (quit)

In that same directory, also remake the index and toc web pages by doing invoking ant (no argument needed).

    ant

(Need to consider whether to do this in help/fr, and eventually others)

Run the program and make sure help works.

    git commit -m"JavaHelp indexing update" .

================================================================================
## General Maintenance Items

We roll some general code maintenance items into the release process.  They can be skipped occasionally.

- Check for any files with multiple UTF-8 Byte-Order-Marks.  This shouldn't usually happen but when it does can be a bit tricky to find. Scan from the root of the repository and fix any files found:

        grep -rlI --exclude-dir=.git $'\xEF\xBB\xBF\xEF\xBB\xBF'

It might be necessary to use a Hex editor to remove the erroneous extra Byte-Order-Marks - a valid UTF-8 file should only have either one 3-byte BOM (EF BB BF) or no BOM at all.

- Run "ant alltest"; make sure they all pass; fix problems and commit back

- Run "ant decoderpro"; check for no startup errors, right version, help index present and working OK. Fix problems and commit back.

- This is a good place to check that the decoder XSLT transforms work

        cd xml/XSLT
        ant
        
If you fix anything, commit it back.

- This is a good place to make sure CATS still builds

        http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/CATS.shtml
        
- If you fixed anything, commit it back.

================================================================================
## Create the Release Branch

- Commit any remaining changes, push to your local repository, bring back to the main JMRI/JMRI repository with a pull request, wait for the CI test to complete, and merge the pull request.

- Create a [new milestone](https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones) with the new release number

- Create the _next_ release note, so that people will document new (overlapping) changes there. (We need to work through automation of version number values below)
    
        cd (local web copy)/releasenotes
        git pull 
        cp jmri4.1.4.shtml jmri4.1.5.shtml
        (edit the new release note accordingly)
            change numbers throughout
            move new warnings to old
            remove old-version change notes
        git add jmri4.1.5.shtml
        git commit -m"start new 4.1.5 release note" jmri4.1.5.shtml
        PR and pull back.
        cd (local JMRI copy)

- Pull back to make sure your repository is fully up to date

- Start the release by creating a new "release branch" using Ant.  (If you need to make a "branch from a branch", such as nearing the end of the development cycle, this will need to be done manually rather than via ant.)

    ant make-test-release-branch

This will do (more or less) the following actions:

    git checkout master
    git pull
    (commit a version number increment to master)
    git push JMRI/JMRI master
    git checkout -b {branch}
    git push JMRI/JMRI {branch}
    git checkout master    
    git pull


 - Put a comment in the release GitHub item saying the branch exists, and all future changes should be documented in the new release note
 
```
The release-4.1.4 branch has been created. 

From now on, please document your changes in the [jmri4.1.5.shtml](https://github.com/JMRI/website/blob/master/releasenotes/jmri4.1.5.shtml) release note file.

Maintainers, please set the 4.1.5 milestone on pulls from now on.
```

================================================================================
## Build Files with Jenkins

- Log in to the [Jenkins CI engine](http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Test%20Releases/)

- Click "New Item"

- Click "Copy Existing Item", and enter the name of the most recent release. Fill out the new release name at the top. Click "OK"

- Update

        Project Name
        Description
        Git Modules: Branch
    
and click "Save"

- The build will start shortly (or click "Build Now"). Wait for it to complete.

====================================================================================
#### Local-build Alternative

If you can't use Jenkins for the actual build, you can create the files locally:

If you're building locally:
* You need to have installed NSIS from http://nsis.sourceforge.net (we use version 2.44)
* Either make sure that 'makensis' is in your path, or set nsis.home in your local.properties file to the root of the nsis installation:

        nsis.home=/opt/nsis/nsis-2.46/

- Get the release in your local work directory

    git checkout release-4.1.4

- edit release.properties to say release.official=true (last line)

- Do the build:

    ant -Dnsis.home="" clean packages

Ant will do the various builds, construct the distribution directories, and finally construct the Linux, Mac OS X and Windows distribution files in dist/releases/

- Put the Linux, Mac OS X and Windows files where developers can take a quick look, send an email to the developer list, and WAIT FOR SOME REPLIES
     
The main JMRI web site gets completely overwritten by Jenkins, so one approach:
    
        ssh user,jmri@shell.sf.net create
        scp dist/release/JMRI.* user,jmri@shell.sf.net:htdocs/release/
    
puts them at
    
        http://user.users.sf.net/release
    
(The user has to have put the htdocs link in their SF.net account)

================================================================================
## Further Changes

If anybody wants to add a change from here on in, they should

- commit it to a branch of their own, and push as needed to get it to their GitHub fork.

- On the GitHub web site, make _two_ pull requests:  

   - One to master, as usual
   
   - One to the release branch e.g. "release-4.1.4".  The comment on this PR should explain why this should be included instead of waiting for the next release.
   
  Merging the PR to the master makes those changes available on further developments forever; the one on the release, if accepted, includes the change and kicks off new runs of the various CI and build jobs.

  Note: The GitHub automated CI tests do their build after doing a (temporary) merge with the target branch. If the release branch and master have diverged enough that a single set of changes can't be used with both, a more complicated procedure than above might be needed.  In that case, try a PR onto the release branch of the needed change, and then pull the release branch back onto the master branch before fixing conflicts.

================================================================================
## Release-specific Updates

- Change the release note to point to the just-built files (in CI or where you put them), commit, wait (or force via "(Build Now)"[http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Web%20Site/job/Website%20from%20JMRI%20GitHub%20website%20repository/]) update. Confirm visible on web.

- Announce the file set to jmri-developers with a download URL like:

    http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Test%20Releases/job/4.1.4/

- *Wait for some replies* before proceeding

====================================================================================
## Release Files on SF.net


- Upload the Linux, Mac OS X and Windows files to sourceforge

Download from CI, check integrity (make sure compressed files not expanded), then do (replace "user" with your SourceForge.net user name; must have SSH keys for SourceForge.net set up)

(If you use a browser to download instead of curl, make sure the .tgz wasn't auto-expanded)

(the "./testrelease 4.1.4" local script on shell.sf.net does the following steps, except for the edit, of course)

    ssh user,jmri@shell.sf.net create
    ssh user,jmri@shell.sf.net
    curl -o release.zip "http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Test%20Releases/job/4.1.4/ws/dist/release/*zip*/release.zip"
    rm release/JMRI*
    unzip release.zip
    cd release
    sha256sum JMRI*   (use 'shasum -a 256' on shell.sf.net)
        (add the calculated hashes for each file to the release note; if a prod release, also on on the direct link on index.html)
    scp JMRI.* ${USER}@"frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/j/jm/jmri/test\ files/"
        (the scp is needed even if on SF.net, so that the FRS system knows you've added something; using cp is NFG)
        (for production release, use ".../production\ files/")
    
    (clean up and logout)

- Create and upload the JavaDocs (as of late 2013, [CloudBees](https://jmri.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Development/job/Web%20Site/job/Generate%20Website%20Components/) was updating these from git weekly, in which case skip): 

    ant javadoc-uml uploadjavadoc

- Create and upload the XSLT'd decoder pages

    (cd xml/XSLT; ant xslt upload)

Note: the very first time doing this on a new machine, it will be required to run the rsync command manually as the ssh fingerprint for the server wil need to be added to the local machine. Without this, it will fail via ant.

- Wait until the downloads have propagated to the mirrors; check by trying to download each file

====================================================================================
## Create GitHub Release

This puts the right tag on the branch, then removes the branch.  If we decide not to use GitHub releases, those steps need to be included in separate instructions.

Note: Unlike releasing files to SourceForge, once a GitHub Release is created it is *not* possible to change it to refer to different contents. Once it's done, you need to move on to the next release number.

- Turn off the Jenkins job; this is so it doesn't fail after later steps

- Close the [current milestone](https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones) with the current release number

- on GitHub JMRI/JMRI go to the "releases" link, then click "Draft a new release" e.g.

    https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/releases/new

- Fill out form:
```
    "tag version field" gets vN.N.N (e.g. leading lower-case "v")
    @ branch: select the release-n.n.n release branch
    "Release title" field gets "Test/Prod Release N.N.N"
    Drop a link to the release note in the discussion field (for now)
    Attach files by dragging them in (you might have to have downloaded them above via e.g. a separate 

    curl -o release.zip "http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Test%20Releases/job/4.1.4/ws/dist/release/*zip*/release.zip" 

    and expansion; it's slow to upload from a typical home machine, though, so wish we had a way to cross-load from somewhere fast - if release.zip is still on SF.net, you can do
    ssh jacobsen,jmri@shell.sf.net create
    scp jacobsen,jmri@shell.sf.net:release.zip .

    then expand the release.zip file and drag-and-drop the three files onto the web page one at a time.

    Note there's a little progress bar that has to go across & "Uploading your release now..." has to complete before you publish
    
    Click "Publish Release"
    Wait for completion, which might be a while with big uploads
```

(It might be possible to automate this in Ant, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24585609/upload-build-artifact-to-github-as-release-in-jenkins and https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/103 )
    
- Once the tag is in place (confirm that!), manually delete the release-4.1.4 branch via the [GitHub UI](https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/branches).

====================================================================================
## Associated Documentation

- Format the release note page: change date, comment out "draft release", make sure links work and proper sections are commented/not commented out

- Update the web site front page and downloads page:

     index.html download/Sidebar download/index.shtml releaselist

- Commit site, push, etc.

- Consider submitting an anti-virus white-list request at:

        https://submit.symantec.com/whitelist/isv/

    If you don't, a bunch of Windows users are likely to whine

- For production releases, file copyright registration

    https://eco.copyright.gov/eService_enu/   (Firefox only!)

- Wait for update on JMRI web server (or [ask Jenkins](http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Web%20Site/) to speed it along; note there are multiple components that need to run)

====================================================================================
## Announcement and Post-release Steps

- Mail announcement to jmriusers@yahoogroups.com

    Subject is "Test version 4.1.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download" or "JMRI 4.0 is available for download"

- If a production version, update the SF automatic download icon by selecting default in SF.net FRS (3 times)

- Wait a day for complaints

- If production release, mail announcement to jmri-announce@lists.sourceforge.net

- Decide if worth announcing elsewhere (production version or big system-specific fix/feature):

        RailRoadSoftware&yahoogroups.com
        MAC_DCC@yahoogroups.com
        loconet_hackers@yahoogroups.com
        digitrax@yahoogroups.com
        NCE-DCC@yahoogroups.com
        NCE-SYS1@yahoogroups.com
        easydcc@yahoogroups.com
        Model_TRAINS_DCC_Software@yahoogroups.com
        DigitalPlusbyLenz@yahoogroups.com
        linux-dcc@yahoogroups.com
        rrsoftware@yahoogroups.com
        Apple MacOS Software

- Commit back any changes made to this doc

- Close the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues) with a comment that sums up the release-build experience

- Take a break!


================================================================================

## Notes for those attempting this on MS Windows platform:

Given that many of the steps involved assume the behaviour of certain POSIX commands (for which there are either no direct equivalent or have subtle behavioural differences), it is easiest to perform these tasks via Cygwin:

    https://cygwin.com/index.html

Cygwin is a set of tools to provide a POSIX-like experience on MS Windows.

(Better still, if possible, setup a Linux Virtual Machine under Windows - this will enable you to follow the 'normal' steps for non-Windows platforms)

Download the setup file for your platform (x86 or x86_64) and then run the installer, mainly using the defaults, but also add the following packages:

    curl
    dos2unix
    openssh
    rsync
    subversion
    tcsh
    unzip

Other useful packages could be:

    nano        <-- a text editor
    ssh-pageant <-- allows use of PuTTY Pageant for sharing ssh key storage
                    between Windows and Cygwin sessions. Without, OpenSSH will
                    be used independently in Cygwin vs. Windows.
                    For set-up, see: https://github.com/cuviper/ssh-pageant

It will also be necessary to set-up/verify various environment variables:

    JAVA_HOME   <-- Location of JDK (i.e. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25)
    PATH        <-- Needs to contain path towards ant

        PATH example (assuming Ant from NetBeans 8.0.1):
            for ant, add ";C:\Program Files\NetBeans 8.0.1\extide\ant\bin"

Once launched, it will be necessary to navigate to your local Windows drive:

    cd /cygdrive/c

Alternatively, if your work files are stored in 'Documents\JMRIDevelopment', you can create a symlink via:

    ln -s /cygdrive/c/Users/[userid]/Documents/JMRIDevelopment JMRIDevelopment

This will allow you to navigate straight from the Cygwin home to the JMRIDev directory via:

    cd JMRIDevelopment

Also, it will be necessary to work in a Cygwin-specific SVN repository as one checked-out under MS Windows will have CRLF line-endings whereas one checked-out within Cygwin (and using the Cygwin svn tools) will have LF line-endings.

Some of the operations that are performed will still generate files with CRLF line-ends (even within the Cygwin environment) - for these, run the changed files through 'dos2unix'. To get a list of changed files, use 'svn st' at top of repo.
