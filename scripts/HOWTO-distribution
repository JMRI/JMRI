This is the HOWTO file to make a complete SourceForge downloadable
distribution.  ($Revision$)

You need to have installed NSIS from http://nsis.sourceforge.net (we use version 2.44)

Start with a development directory that is at (or at least near) the HEAD of SVN

Make sure SVN is up-to-date:

( ) If it's a new year, update copyright dates (done for 2010):
    * build.xml (2) in the javadoc instructions
    * site/Copyright.html (3 places)
    * xml/XSLT masters and stylesheets
    * (grep -r for the previous year in the web site, xml; don't change copyright notices!)
    * Windows installer script
        bbedit WinInstallFiles/InstallJMRI.nsi
    * Linux scripts
        bbedit DecoderPro PanelPro SoundPro cornwall JmriDemo LocoTools InstallTest DispatcherPro SignalPro DecoderPro3

( ) Bring in patches to date, including decoders

( ) Check if the decoder definitions have changed since the previous tag
    If so, remake the decoder index. 
        Delete old index from preferences
        Run program in your development dir, remake index
        Make sure file is saved with Unix line ends.
        Diff w file in SVN tree as a check.
        Copy the new file from preferences into the SVN tree.
        Update the version number by hand, adding 2.
        Commit.
    
( ) Update the help/en/Acknowledgements.shtml help page with any recent changes

( ) Check for uncommitted changes in the web site directory, 
    these can end up in help, xml, etc

( ) Remake the help index  (need a command line approach, so can put in ant!)
    ./JHelpDev.csh   (See the doc page for setup)
    (navigate to JHelpDev.xml in release & open it)
    (click "generate all")

    In that same directory, also remake the index and toc web
    pages by doing invoking ant (no argument needed). 
    
    ant
    
    (You may need to remove the DOCTYPE lines, as the Sun DTD may be
    unavailable:  Map.jhm, JmriHelp_enTOC.xml, JmriHelp_enIndex.xml)
    
    Run the program and make sure help works.
    
    Commit any changed files.

( ) Confirm that all the above changes have been committed back to SVN

( ) This is a good place to check that the JavaDocs generate without errors.
    If you fix anything, commit it back.

( ) This is a good place to check that the decoder XSLT transforms work
    If you fix anything, commit it back.

( ) Start the release by copying the current HEAD in SVN:

    svn cp ${SVNREPO}/trunk/jmri ${SVNREPO}/releases/Release-2-13-1

    Move to the releases/ part of the SVN tree on your local machine
    and update to get the release copy:
    
    cd ../../releases
    svn update Release-2-13-1
    
    
    
    
================================================================================
In the next section, we need to work through automation of version number values
================================================================================

( ) Check that the Version.java file has been updated (both version
    number in two places and copyright date), has released=true set
    and has been committed to CVS
    
( ) Edit the version number into the top help page:
    bbedit help/en/index.html
                   
( ) Edit the "manifest" file in your development directory, and make sure that the
    version number is correct in four places (this file comes from java/, not scripts/)
        
( ) Run "ant clean alltest" just to be sure

( ) Update the MacOS X bundle version numbers:
    
    cd scripts
    bbedit MacOSXapps/V1/*.app/Contents/Info.plist
    (three versions, two copyright years)

    sed -i '' s/2.11.8/2.11.9/g MacOSXapps/V1/*.app/Contents/Info.plist

( ) Update copyright date in Windows installer script
    (note version number and output filename now determined via dist.xml)

    bbedit WinInstallFiles/InstallJMRI.nsi
    
( ) Update version numbers (and copyright dates) in Linux scripts

    bbedit DecoderPro PanelPro SoundPro cornwall JmriDemo LocoTools InstallTest DispatcherPro SignalPro DecoderPro3

    sed -i '' s/2.11.8/2.11.9/g  DecoderPro PanelPro SoundPro cornwall JmriDemo LocoTools InstallTest DispatcherPro SignalPro DecoderPro3


( ) Update the release number in the build.xml file. This is in three lines on the 1st page:
    <property name="release.major" value="2" />
    <property name="release.minor" value="13" />
    <property name="release.build" value="1" />

====================================================================================
    
    Tests before the actual build:
    
    ( ) run "ant alltests"; make sure they all pass
    
    ( ) run "ant decoderpro"; check for no startup errors, right version, help index present and working OK.
        
====================================================================================

    Start the actual build!

( ) ant -Dnsis.home="" packages
	
    Ant will do the various builds, construct the distribution
    directories, and finally construct the Linux, MacOS X and Windows
    distribution files in dist/releases/
	
( ) The next few steps can be done in parallel.

** Consider testing Windows installer on a VM

( ) Put the Linux, Mac OS X and Windows files where developers can
    take a quick look, send an email, and WAIT FOR SOME REPLIES
    
( ) Upload the Linux, Mac OS X and Windows files
     
    Manually:
    scp JMRI.2.11.8.tgz jacobsen,jmri@"frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/j/jm/jmri/test\ files/"

    Wait until the downloads have propagated to the mirrors; check 
    by trying to download each file
    
    Ask JMRI-developers for a quick look _AND_ _WAIT_ _FOR_ _IT_!!

( ) Any time after "ant packages" is complete, create and upload the JavaDocs
    and XSLT'd decoder pages (you need to have Java 1.6 in ~/.ant/ant.conf)
    
	ant javadoc-uml
	ant uploadjavadoc
	cd xml/XSLT
	ant
	ant upload
	
	Set ~/.ant/ant.conf back to Java 1.5 afterwards
	
( ) Format the release note page, change date, etc

( ) Commit release note files to the web site SVN directory
    
( ) Complete all the above before continuing

( ) Update the web site front page and downloads page
    		
( ) If the decoder definitions have changed, make a .zip file and send to:
    Graham Plowman: gppsoftware@gppsoftware.com

( ) Create the start of a release note for the next version

( ) Commit site
	
( ) File copyright registration

    https://eco.copyright.gov/eService_enu/   (Firefox only!)

( ) Wait for update on JMRI web server

( ) Mail announcement to jmriusers@yahoogroups.com
    Subject is "Test version 2.11.8 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download"

( ) Mail announcement to jmri-announce@lists.sourceforge.net

    You'll get a moderation message via email; handle it.

( ) News item from JMRI sourceforge page, Develop tab

	Title is of the form "JMRI 2.11.8 test version is available";
	text is pretty much directly taken from the release note

( ) If a production version, update the SF automatic download icon by selecting default in FRS
        
( ) Decide if worth announcing elsewhere (production version or 
	big system-specific fix/feature):
