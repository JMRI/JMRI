( ) update the site/demosFiles/Recent.update.README.html to include 
    any changes, esp. including updating the release name and URLs. 
    
( ) Copy site/demosFiles/Recent.update.README.html 
    to JMRI.0.9.2.update.README and turn into a text file

( ) apps.DecoderPro.DecoderPro needs to have the version number updated.

( ) Commit all cvs source and tag "Release-9-2"

( ) Rebuild, make the jmri.jar file 

( ) Move the jmri.jar file to the distribution folder

( ) Remove the .DS_Store, .FBCIndex, .FBCLockFolder files in the distribution

( ) Update the xml subdirectory, removing the CVS subdirs

( ) Create the JMRI.0.9.2.update.zip file with DropZip

( ) Make an opt-copy of the folder to the desktop, then install into 
    a copy of the previous distribution and test
    
( ) Test .zip as update under Windows, under OS 9

( ) Move to distribution site via SourceForge release:
