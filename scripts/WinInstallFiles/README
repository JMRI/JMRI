The definitive copy of LaunchJMRI.exe is kept in Git in this directory.  This keeps it stable in the interest of managing the large number of anti-virus approaches on Windows systems.

Should you need to recreate the LaunchJMRI.exe use 'ant launchjmri.exe` or

/opt/local/bin/makensis -V2 LaunchJMRI.nsi

Note that this ant target is not included in the package-windows target: We  do not remake the LaunchJMRI.exe file as part of the build of the release packages.  

Note that there have been problems reported doing this on macOS, though others have made it work. Check that the length of the created file is reasonable.
