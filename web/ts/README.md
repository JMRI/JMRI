This directory contains JavaScript .js and TypeScript .ts files.  Modifications here will result in updates in the runtime ../js directory when rebuilt.

To build the files, see the web site: https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Patterns.shtml#typescript

Some files uses classes introduced in JavaScript [ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp), so we use "es6" as the compilation target.
