The jython/ctc directory contains example and utility scripts for the [JMRI USS CTC](https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/package-summary.html) package of tools.
See the [documentation page](https://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/uss/index.shtml).

The [jython/ctc/TwoColumnMachine.py](https://jmri.org/jython/ctc/TwoColumnMachine.py) example script animates a sample two-column CTC machine. To use it, load the [jython/ctc/TwoColumnMachine.xml](https://jmri.org/jython/ctc/TwoColumnMachine.xml) panel file first, then run the sample script. See also the [README.md](https://jmri.org/jython/ctc/README.md) file. It uses the naming conventions that are described on a [documentation page](https://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/uss/Conventions.shtml), though of course you can use any names you'd like.
