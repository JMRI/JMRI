# To make one selection of a SensorGroup a "none of the above" choice
#
# SensorGroups make sure that only one item is ACTIVE, but it's possible 
# for none to be.  If you have panel levers with physical sensors for LEFT
# and RIGHT, use one of these to get a NONE sensor.
#
# Ideally, this would get the list of sensors from the sensor group itself,
# but that's surprisingly hard.
