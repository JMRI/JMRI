# This is an example script for a JMRI "Automat" in Python
#
# It builds a consist out of two locomotives, moves the consist at 50% speed 
# until a stop sensor is encountered, when it stops the consist and then 
# breaks the consist appart.
#
# Note: This script does not currently check for errors
