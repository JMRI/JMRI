This folder contains a Jynstrument to be used in a JMRI throttle window.
This Jynstrument allow to use any input device recognized by JInput to drive the throttle window where it was dropped.

Just drop this folder in the throttle window toolbar, then right click on the icon to see all available input devices and select one.


The code in USBThrottle.py will try to load a driver name :
 - by device name first,
 - then by device type,
 - then load Default.py driver if none of the above in found.

All device components names and related values will be printed on the JMRI output as input are triggered.


To create a customized driver for your own device :
 - retrieve its name from the JMRI ouput, you should see some line like :
      Trying to import driver by name "YourDriverName.py" ...
  - create a copy of Default.py named YourDriverName.py,
  - then edit this file to match components names and values as per log output.
