# For each real or imaginary hardware turnout on a Master DCC connection,
# with a matching hardware address on a Slave DCC connection,
# provide a Listener that copies instructions for changes of state
# from the Master turnout to the Slave turnout.
#
#####
#   For your layout, modify the values for
#       MasterIdentiferPrefix
#   and
#       SlaveIdentierPrefix
#   found at lines # 70 and 71 to match the DCC local hardware.
#####
#
# The throttles on the Master DCC connection send state instructions to
# hypothetical turnouts with real hardware addresses and TurnoutMasterSlave
# echoes those commands to the Slave DCC connection that is connected to real
# hardware turnouts that are invisible to the throttles.

MasterIdentiferPrefix and SlaveIdentierPrefix values are
almost always the two-letter prefixes for turnouts.

In the case of two or more duplications of connections with
the same manufacturer, the prefix can be two lettere and a digit.

User options for alternative
prefixes are not discussed here.

Examine the Connection Tab of the Preferences Window for more information.
Some DEFAULT examples are listed here.  PLEASE VERIFY FOR YOUR LAYOUT!
    "IT2"   for None
    "DT"    for Anyma DMX512
    "XT"    for XpressNet, could be Atlas or CTI or Hornby or Lenz
    "AT"    for Bachrus AKA Speedo or for CTI Electronics or for KPF-Zeller
    "CT"    for C/MRI
    "DT"    for DCC++ or for DCC4PC
    "LT"    for Digitrax
    "UT"    for ECoS
    "ET"    for EasyDCC
    "ZT"    for IEEE802.15.4
    "JT"    for JMRI (Network)
    "MT"    for LCC or for MQTT or for MRC
    "TT"    for Lionel TMCC
    "FT"    for MERG
    "NT"    for NCE

        and a lot more

Note that the addressing has to have the same structure.  LT123 can be mapped to NT123,
but cannot be mapped to MT11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88;11.22.33.44.55.66.77.99
