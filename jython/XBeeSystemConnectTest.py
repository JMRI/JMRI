# This script demonstrates the ability to connect a stream port
# controller to an XBee node.  The port controller then behaves
# like any other connection, but the data is tunneled via the
# XBee Network.
#
# This version of the script performs all the actions required to
# gather the streams and create the port controller object.
#
# Derived from XBeeRemoteSerialPortTest.py

# We use an Automat object to create a separate thread
# that can sit there, waiting for each character to 
# arrive.  Sending characters, on the other hand, 
# happens immediately.
