# This produces a user interface to Dispatcher to speedily set it up.

# Starting from a system with

# 1) a layout panel setup with track, blocks and signals,
# 2) certain blocks marked as stations, and
# 3) some engines set up with speed profiles

# it creates a system with

# 1) a set of transits and train info files enabling trains to run anywhere on the layout using dispatcher
# 2) A set of station buttons inserted on the panel which allow trains to run station to station under dispatcher
# 3) Provision to set up routes so that trains can be sent along these routes
# 4) A scheduler to enable trains to run at preset times
# 5) Timetables showing the scheduled trains
# 6) A set of buttons provided on the panel which enable you to setup and run the system easily

# The system is stored in the Dispatcher System folder.

# Procedure
# 1) Run DispatcherSystem.py (versions in the dispatcher folder or in the main jython area).
# 2) Read the help accessed from the menu to get detailed instructions on how to run the system
