# Sample script to set all turnouts in Unknown state to Closed
#
# After this script is turn, there should be no Turnouts in the
# UNKNOWN state; any that were at the start should have been set to CLOSED.
#
# By skipping over Turnouts that have already been set, this minimizes
# the chance of disturbing e.g. Turnouts driving signals that have already been set
# by signal logic.
