# Sample script showing how to replace car loads at a location.
# Used in operations.  This script will load all cars of a
# given type at a location and track with the car loads you specify.

# Part of the JMRI distribution
#
# To use this script you must assign the location, tracks, car type
# and car loads.
#
# Location to load cars (see self.locationName below, replace locationName) 
#
# Tracks at the above location that will load your cars
# replace trackName1, trackName2, trackName3, etc. with the
# names of your tracks.  You can add more, or delete the one you 
# don't need.
#
# The car type, (see self.carTypeName, replace carTypeName)
#
# Car loads, (see self.carLoadNames, replace carLoadName1, carLoadName2, carLoadName3, etc)
# The first car will be loaded with carLoadName1, the second carLoadName2, etc, until
# all loads are used, and then will begin again with carLoadName1.
#
# The car loads you want to replace, (see self.carReplaceLoads)
#
# The number of car loads you want to replace. (see self.number)
