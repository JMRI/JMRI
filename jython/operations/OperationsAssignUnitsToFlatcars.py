# Sample script to assign containers and trailers to flat cars.
#
#
# Author: Daniel Boudreau, copyright 2015
# Part of the JMRI distribution
#
# To use this script you must provide the type names for containers and trailers, and the type names for the flatcars to use. 
# You must also enter the train name that will service them. The train doesn't have to service the flatcars, this script will
# do the flatcar assignments based on the container or trailer destinations. Run this script after the train is built.
#
# When there isn't enough flatcars for the containers or trailers, the script will produce a warning message and remove them
# from the train.
#
# Some minor issues with this script:
# It will never assign two 20 foot containers and one 40 foot container to the same flatcar. It can do one of each.
# It doesn't consider the best allocation of flatcars, it can assign a single trailer to a flatcar that can hold two trailers,
# even of there's a flatcar available that can only hold one trailer.
