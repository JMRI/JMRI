# Many Thanks to Bob Jacobsen and Everyone who Contributes to JMRI.
# 
# Script should work for any DCC System that supports Ops Mode Programming or 
# Programming on Mainline. (Digitrax, NEC, MRC, Lenz)
#
# You should copy this file to ProgramBlockWatcher????.py Replacing ???? 
# with the Primary Address of your BlockWatcher. You should keep this file 
# for backup, and future tweaking and programming.
#
# Each group of program lines is documented. To execute a group of statements, remove 
# the # from the beginning of the proceeding program lines.  Edit the program lines  
# to include necessary information for your BlockWatcher.
#
# Be Sure to remove the # from the "self.waitMsec(750)" line. This gives the BlockWatcher sufficient
# time to process each preceding command.
#
# This script uses Locomotive Address 9983.  Please make sure there is NO Locomotive number 9983
# on your layout while running this script.  This script will reprogram several of its CV's.
#
# Instructions
# 1. Turn Off Track Power - Use a Throttle or JMRI to do this.
# 2. Move the Program Jumper J3 from either [J3-2 J3-3] or [J3-3 J3-4] To [J3-1 J3-2](Program Mode)
# 3. Turn On Track Power - Again, Use a Throttle or JMRI.
# 4. VERY IMPORTANT - Wait 30 to 45 Seconds.
# 5. In JMRI Decoder Pro, Go to Panels > Run Script.  Select the file that corresponds
#    to the BlockWatcher you are programming.  Note - Do not have the file open in an editor.
#
# Important - This script can take 2 to 6 seconds to run. This depends on the number of 
#             CV's and addresses being programmed.
# 
#             When the script is complete, a small message window should appear. Usually
#             in the upper left corner of your screen.
#
# 6. Turn Off Track Power.
# 7. Move the program jumper J3 from [J3-1 J3-2] back to [J2-2 J2-3](Automatic Setting Leakage Current)
#    or [J3-3 J3-4](Leakage Current Set with CV).
# 8. Turn Track Power On.
# 9. Test you BlockWatcher.

    # Sets the delay in milliseconds that the block current exceeds the trip level

    # of time the block current is below the trip level before the J4 output turns
    # off. The default value is 32 ms.

    # This CV sets the average value of the block current when it is unoccupied. 
    # The J4 turn on threshold is 3 + CV54 + CV55. The turn off threshold is 3 + CV54. 
    # The scaling value is 0.534 mA per bit. The default is 0, which will result in
    # a trip current of about 2 mA. The maximum value is 254 � CV55 � 3. 
    # This sets the maximum trip current to about 130 mA. 
    # (With J3 on pins 2-3 this value is set each time power is applied to the detector.)

    # Last Two Lines of this Group - CV55 - Hysterisis Between On and Off
    # Sets the hysterisis between on and off (see CV54). Its default value is 1.
    # This keeps the detector fromfluttering when the detected current is near the switching point.
