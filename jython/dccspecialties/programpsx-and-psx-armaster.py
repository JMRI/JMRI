# Many Thanks to Bob Jacobsen and Everyone who Contributes to JMRI.
# 
# Script should work for any DCC System that supports Ops Mode Programming or 
# Programming on Mainline. (Digitrax, NEC, MRC, Lenz)
#
# You should copy this file to ProgramPSX&PSX-AR????.py Replacing ???? with the 
# Primary Address of your PSX or PSX-AR. You should keep this file for backup, and 
# future tweaking and programming.
#
# Each group of program lines is documented. To execute a group of statements, remove 
# the # from the beginning of the proceeding program lines.  Edit the program lines
# to include necessary information for your PSX or PSX-AR.
#
# Be Sure to remove the # from the "self.waitMsec(750)" line. This gives the PSX or PSX-AR sufficient
# time to process each preceding command.
#
# This script uses Locomotive Address 9983.  Please make sure there is NO Locomotive number 9983
# on your layout while running this script.  This script will reprogram several of its CV's.
#
# Instructions
# 1. Turn Off Track Power - Use a Throttle or JMRI to do this.
# 2. Move the Program Jumper J3 From [J3-2 J3-3] To [J3-1 J3-2](Program Mode)
# 3. Turn On Track Power - Again, Use a Throttle or JMRI.
# 4. VERY IMPORTANT - Wait 30 to 45 Seconds.
# 5. In JMRI Decoder Pro, Go to Panels > Run Script.  Select the file that corresponds
#    to the PSX or PSX-AR you are programming.  Note - Do not have the file open in an editor.
#
# Important - This script can take 3 to 6 seconds to run. This depends on the number of 
#             CV's and addresses being programmed.
# 
#             When the script is complete, a small message window should appear. Usually
#             in the upper left corner of your screen.
#
# 6. Turn Off Track Power.
# 7. Move the program jumper J3 from [J3-1 J3-2] to [J3-2 J3-3] (Normal Operation).
# 8. Wait at least 1 full minute before Turn Track Power On.
# 9. Test you PSX or PSX-AR.
