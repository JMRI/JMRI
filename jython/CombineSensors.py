# Make a master sensor follow a set of follower sensor
# *) Changes to the known state of the followers map to the known state of the master,
#       following the rules (first applied wins)
#          Any UNKNOWN -> UNKNOWN
#          Any INCONSISTENT -> INCONSISTENT
#          Any ACTIVE -> ACTIVE
#          All INACTIVE -> INACTIVE
#          Otherwise, INCONSISTENT
# *) changes to the known state of the master does nothing
#
# This is hard to do properly in Logix due to limited access to states
# and events (can't tell which change happened due to what)
