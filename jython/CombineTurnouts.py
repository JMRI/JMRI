# Make a set of turnouts follow a single one
# *) Changes to commanded state of the master are copied to the followers
# *) Changes to the known state of the followers map to the known state of the master,
#       following the rules (first applied wins)
#          Any UNKNOWN -> UNKNOWN
#          Any INCONSISTENT -> INCONSISTENT
#          All THROWN -> THROWN
#          All CLOSED -> CLOSED
#          Otherwise, INCONSISTENT
#
# This is hard to do properly in Logix due to limited access to states
# and events (can't tell which change happened due to what)
