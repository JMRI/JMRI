# Sample script showing how to operate a grade crossing with block detection.
#
# This scrip requires an already configured audio buffer loaded with a .wav 
# file of the users choice. It also requires an audio source configure to use
# the audio buffer.
#
# This script will detect a train entering any approach block that is listed in 
# approachBloks and will play the sound (.wave file). The sound will play until
# the train exits all island blocks listed in islandBlocks or if the train backs
# out of the approach block or if the island block is not occupied with in the
# the delay setting (the sound will start again if the island is later occupied).
#
# The ability to control crossing gates and signals can easily be added the the 
# GradeCrossingListener.StartGradeCrossing and 
# GradeCrossingListener.StopGradeCrossing methods.
