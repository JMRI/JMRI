# Our sample AppleScript tells the Finder to make a new folder called
# "untitled folder" on the Desktop.  Yes, that's not an important thing
# to do, but it's a good example.

script = \
"tell application \"Finder\"\n"+ \
"  make new folder at desktop\n"+ \
"end tell\n"

# Create an NSAppleScript object to execute our script
myScript = com.apple.cocoa.foundation.NSAppleScript(script);

# Create a dictionary to hold any errors that are
# encountered during script execution
errors = com.apple.cocoa.foundation.NSMutableDictionary()

# Execute the script!
myScript.execute(errors)
