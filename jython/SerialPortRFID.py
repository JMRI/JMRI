# To receive some data via a serial RFID concentrator
#
# Author: Nigel Cliffe, Copyright 30th June 2009. 
# Derived from SerialPortTest by Bob Jacobsen

# Reads serial port input and writes the results to one of eight memory variables.
# The results can be used to alter layout behaviour, such as switching turnouts, signals
# and trackside devices through Logix, or driving the locomotive (or locomotive 
# functions) through a (jython script) robot throttle.  
#
# The MERG RFID concentrator takes input from eight tag readers (A to H), and sends
# a line of serial data containing the tag reader and the tag value. 
# The line of data is in form   >A1235678G123  where the > is the first character, the second
# character is the reader identity, and the remainder of the line the tag identity. 
# This script will put the tag value into a memory variable associated with each reader.
#
# Various extensions are possible, such as a lookup table to convert tag identity to a more 
# meaningful name, such as locomotive name or DCC address.  
#
# An alternative approach (not in this script) would be to record the location data 
# (tag reader) against each item of stock,
