Mac OS X has fat (multi-architecture) binaries, and single
architecture binaries.  Fat ones can go here, single architecture
ones should go into the correct subdir.

For Catalina, these were signed via e.g.
codesign -v -s "Developer ID Application: firstname lastname" lib/macosx/libgluegen-rt.jnilib 

The signature can be checked with e.g.
codesign -dv --verbose=4 lib/macosx/libgluegen-rt.jnilib
