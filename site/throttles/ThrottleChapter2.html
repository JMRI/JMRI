				<P>This chapter will walk you through the process of opening up a new throttle window
				and then configuring it to run a locomotive on your layout.  For the purposes of this
				user guide, we will be using a locomotive that has been equipped with a sound decoder.
				The decoder's address in our examples here is <B>8251</B>.  If you are following along
				with a locomotive of your own while you read this, simply replace your loco's decoder
				address anywhere that "8251" is shown.</P>

							<H5>Control Panel — Let's Run a Train</H5>
							<DIR>
								<P>Now that you have established an address for the throttle, you should be able
								to run the train on your layout (if your layout is active and the address you
								entered is valid to a locomotive on the track).  You do this using the
								"<B>Control Panel</B>" (see Figure 2-5).  But here is where things get a
								little sticky.</P>
								
								<P>There are multiple combinations of DCC systems and computer platforms that
								make up for slight differences in the functionality of the throttles.
								The programmers are working hard at trying to get these throttles to function
								identically.  But because of the these differences, you may discover that not
								everything noted in the following text will function as defined for your system.</P>
								
								<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=2 BORDERCOLOR="red">
									<TR>
										<TD>
											<DIV>
											<FONT COLOR="red">Important!</FONT> &nbsp; 
											The "Control Panel" must have the "focus" for it to become
											active (and usable).  In other words, it's window bar must be active.  If
											you are following along with this text with your own locomotive and just
											entered an address in the Address Panel, you will discover that the Address
											Panel is the window with the current focus.  None of the keyboard or mouse
											actions described below will move the train until the Control Panel has the
											focus.  To make the Control Panel the active window, use your mouse pointer
											to click somewhere within the Control Panel.
											</DIV>

									</TR>
								</TABLE>

								<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=2 CELLSPACING=2>

											<CENTER>
											<B><FONT COLOR="red">Beware of where you click with your mouse 
											pointer in the Control Panel.</FONT></B>
											</CENTER>
											
											<BR><BR>

											<UL>
												<LI>If you click anywhere near the slider, your loco may take off on you
												unexpectedly (more on this below).<BR><BR>
												<LI>If you click anywhere on the words "Forward" or "Reverse", you will
												activate that action — which isn't too bad — except if the loco
												is running in the opposite direction from what action you clicked on.<BR><BR>
												<LI>Depending on your screen resolution size, if you attempt to click on the
												window bar itself, you may accidentally close down the Control Panel window or
												minimize it.  This could of course immediately confuse any new user.<BR><BR>
											</UL>
					
											<P>So when first clicking in the Control Panel to make it the "active" window
											with the focus, and you know that your loco is stopped, it is suggested to click
											on the "Idle" button (if you know for fact that your loco is stopped), or the
											forward or reverse area (depending of course on the current direction of the
											loco).  In other words, you want to click somewhere in within the border of the
											Control Panel window — yet not cause your loco to do something that you
											don't want it to do.</P>
					
											<P>After a little experimentation, you will discover what is comfortable for
											your usage.  The only point we are trying to make here is that many new users
											immediately get frustrated with the throttles because they can't get their loco
											to move — not realizing that the Control Panel does not have the focus.
											Or they have clicked on a function button (more on these below), which then
											changes the "active" window to the Function Panel.</P>

									<DIR>
										<P>The Function Panel has 13 function buttons available for each throttle window.  Most
										decoders currently don't handle 13 functions.  (If there are any, please let me know.)
										But the software is prepared for the future.  Some of the more newer hand-held throttles
										also have 13 function buttons (including the lights), so these electronic throttles follow
										these newer hand-helds.</P>
							
										<P>Clicking on the function buttons correlate to pressing the same function button on a
										hand-held throttle.  The F0 function is normally used for the lights.</P>
							
										<P>This is the basic functionality of the Function Panel.  All buttons function like an
										on/off toggle — click once to turn "on"; click again to turn "off".</P>
							
										<P>The next chapter provides more advanced features for customizing the Function Panel
										buttons.</P>
