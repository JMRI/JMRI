<h2>Connecting to a Lenz DCC system</h2>
The situation with connecting to a Lenz system is confusing. The Lenz LI100
interface will allow your computer to talk to XPressNet, but not all
Lenz systems can use XPressNet communications for all functions.
For example, the LH200 handheld from Set 02 can make 
an XPressNet connection with a computer
via an LI100, but will not accept programming instructions over that 
connection.  This means that DecoderPro cannot program decoders through
a Lenz Set 02 if the LH100 handheld is acting as the command station.
<P>
The Set 01 and the LZ100 command station are known to 
work with the LI100 and DecoderPro.
<P>
We don't actually know what the restrictions of the various Lenz systems
are with respect to XPressNet and the LI100.  You should contact Lenz or
your local dealer for information before investing in an LI100.
<P>
Once you have a LI100, connect it to your Lenz system via their
XpressNet connections.  Then connect the LI100 to the computer's serial
port using a 9-pin serial cable.
<P>
Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.  This opens 
automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select it from
the "Edit" menu.  
<P>
Select "Lenz XPressNet" from the top selection box. You can then
select the proper serial port in the second selection box.  
<P>
The baud
rate selection box should be left at 9600 baud unless you've reconfigured
your LI100 (not recommended).  
<P>
The fourth box should be left on
"hardware flow control" unless you later consistently get a message
about the LI100 control leads being improperly set up, in which case
you might want to try to bypass that by selecting "no flow control".
<P>
The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to select
how the program will look.  
"Metal" is the native Java look available on all types. 
Other choices will vary with your computer type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" 
and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X
respectively.
<P>
In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer format. You can
override this each time you open the programmer, so this is here just for convenience.
<P>
Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to quit, click "Yes".
<P>
Restart the program. You should be up and running.
