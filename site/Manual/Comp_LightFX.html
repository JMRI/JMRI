<br>This pane provides for control of some of the most "gee-whiz" functions
on the decoder. While fine-tuning the motor is important, and speed tables
help add to the realism of operation, everyone notices the lights - especially
when they change intensity, flicker, flash, or fade. They attract even
more attention when, for example, the ditch lights that were steadily shining
as the locomotive approached the crossing suddenly begin flashing alternately,
then return to a steady glow; or when a locomotive pulls into a siding,
stops, and dims its headlight for the approaching train.

<p>The specific effects available differ widely between manufacturers,
and even between different "families" of decoders from the same maker.
The above example is from a Digitrax FX decoder. Some of the advanced features
you will see in many decoders (though they may go by different but similar
names) are <b>Lamp Keep-Alive Voltage</b>, <b>FX Rate Adjust</b>, and <b>Ditch
Light Hold-over Time</b>.
<p>The <b>Lamp Keep-Alive Voltage</b> determines how dark a light gets
between "full on" moments. This can let you adjust effects to give the
impression of, for example, a marker light that also has a rotary beacon
in the same housing. Play with this value and see what kind of results
you get for your specific decoder.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>FX RATE Adjust</b> controls how fast an FX effect operates. The higher
the number, the slower the frequency of flash or "rotation" of the effect.
I use this to set subtle differences between my locomotives. As you can
see from the panel above, I use twin alternating strobe lights on my engines.
I vary the setting for the <b>FX Rate</b> slightly so that my locomotives
flash at slightly different rates. This keeps MU'd units from looking <u>too</u>
coordinated!
<p>The <b>Ditch Light Hold-over Time</b> CV establishes how long the ditchlight
effect (alternating flashing) stays activated after you hit the <b>F2</b>
function key. Since the <b>F2</b> key is non-latching (think of it as a
momentary contact switch) it normally turns off when it is released. By
raising the value of this CV you can make them stay on for up to 30 seconds
from a single momentary activation.
<p>The other lighting effects are highly variable between decoders. Check
your specific decoder documentation for what the decoder is supposed to
be capable of, and have fun playing with them. They are the most visually
satisfying of all the capabilities of the decoders!
