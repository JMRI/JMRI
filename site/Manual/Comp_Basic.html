<br>One of the first things you will notice about the expanded Basic Pane
in the Comprehensive Programmer is that there are a lot more options than
you found in the Basic Programmer.

<p>Here we find the CVs for 2 and 4 digit <b>addressing</b>, <b>normal
direction of motion</b>, number of <b>speed steps</b>, and <b>analog</b>
conversion.
<p>The address of a decoder is the prefix for the code it responds to.
This is how you are able to run multiple locomotives on a single line and
keep all their functions independant. Decoders originally could have only
a 2 digit address. Newer decoders can have up to a 4 digit address. The
"<b>Addressing Mode</b>" option lets you choose which mode you want to
use. The addresses themselves are input into the appropriate text boxes.
The "<b>Extended Addressing</b>" check box turns on and off the 4 digit
address mode.
<p>The option for "<b>Normal direction of movement</b>" is important for
people who model railroads like the NS, who ran locomotives long hood forward,
or for the person who occasionaly makes a mistake and hooks the decoder
up in reverse. It lets you change the direction defined in the decoder
as "forward".
<p>Unless your command station or decoder can only handle 14 speed steps,
you'll find you get much finer control of your locomotives by using the
"2<b>8/128 speed steps</b>" option.
<p>"<b>Analog Conversion</b>" mode allows the decoder to run under regular
analog DC voltage control in addition to DCC commands. If you find a locomotive
is "breaking away" and running out of control at high speed, you might
want to disable this capability.
<p>Finally, off to the right you will see "<b>User Private ID #1</b>" and
"<b>User Private ID #2</b>". These CVs have nothing to do with any function
of the decoder. They simply provide you with a method of electronically
marking your equipment. I always use these CVs - it gives me yet one more
way to identify my equipment.
