<br>The Motor Control Pane includes those CVs that allow you to fine-tune
the performance of the locomotive's motor for slow speed starts and smoother
running.

<p>The contents of this pane will vary significantly between different
decoders. In this case, the <b>Kick Start</b>, <b>Acceleration rate</b>,
<b>Deceleration
Rate</b>, and <b>Speed Stabilization</b> (Digitrax's Back EMF) CVs are
listed here.
<p><b>Kick Start </b>is an extra burst of power to help start balky motors.
Compare this to the "<b>Minimum Voltage</b>" CV we'll see in the next pane,
which is a sustained increased level of power. Between the two it is quite
possible to tune a decent quality locomotive so that it creeps at less
than a tie a minute.
<p><b>Acceleration and deceleration rates</b> help simulate a locomotive
under load - but don't use them unless you have very clean track, because
an interruption of power can make a locomotive stop and cycle through the
accelleration curve again! High decelleration rates can make station stops
and switching realistic, but <u>very</u> challenging!
<p>Every manufacturer implements "<b>Back EMF</b>" or "<b>Speed Stabilization</b>"
differently. See your decoder documentation for the best ways to implement
these variables, and be prepared to do a lot of experimenting! However
they do it and whatever they call it, you should find it here.
