This page introduces you to some simple Java constructs for JMRI.  
For information on compiling these, please see the
<A HREF="compile.html">compilation page</a>.
For more complicated
situations, including building the complete JMRI libraries, see our
<A HREF="index.html">Technical page</a>. For more information on JMRI, see the
<A HREF="../index.html">main JMRI page</a>.

<P>
Throughout, we're assuming that you've got a working piece of sample
code that you want to modify and use.  See the 
<A HREF="index.html">Technical pages</a>, particularly the pages on
<A HREF="loconet/LocoNetClasses.html">LocoNet classes</a>, if you want more in-depth information
on how to use the JMRI libraries.

<h2>Java variables</h2>

The Java language requires that you declare a variable before using it.  You do this
by specifying the type and name of the variable. For example:
<PRE>
    int    count;
    
    Sensor sensor1x1;

    Turnout output1;

</PRE>
declares an integer variable "count", a variable that represents an input
sensor called "sensor1x1", and a variable that represents a Turnout called "output1".
You can use letters, digits and the "_" character in names; it's traditional
to start variable names with a lower case letter.
<P>
Integers can be used in the usual type of assignment statements, such as:
<PRE>
   count = 3;
   
   count = oldCount;
   
   count = count + 1;
   
</PRE>
In order, these set the value of "count" to three; set the value of "count"
to the current value of "oldCount", and adds one to the current value of "count".
Note that an integer variable starts out with no specific value; you have to 
assign a value to it before you can use its value, or you'll get an error message.
<P>
Variables representing sensors and turnouts must be initialized before they 
can be used.  That's done with statements like:
<PRE>
        sensor1x1 = InstanceManager.sensorManagerInstance().
                    newSensor(null,"0");

        output1 = InstanceManager.turnoutManagerInstance().
                    newTurnout(null,"1");
</PRE>

In Java, parentheses represent a procedure call, similar to a function or
subroutine call in some other languages.  The "." operator means a reference.
So you read the first of the examples above like:

<PRE>
    Find the InstanceManager
    
        call its "sensorManagerInstance" procedure, which 
        returns the name of a SensorManager 
        
        
           call the "newSensor" procedure of that SensorManager,
           passing it the values "null" and "0"
           
    Assign the result of that procedure to the "sensor1x1" variable.
    
</PRE>
At this point, it's not really necessary to know how put that together. 
It's sufficient that this sequence of operations will set the
"sensor1x1" variable so that it controls the sensor with address "0".
Similarly, the sequence in the second example sets the "output1"
variable so that it controls turnout number 1.

<P>
You can then use these variables to control the layout.  For example:

<PRE>
       if (sensor1x1.getKnownState() == ACTIVE)
                  output1.setCommandedState(OFF);
</PRE>

The "if" statement will check to see if the expression in parentheses 
"sensor1x1.getKnownState() == ACTIVE" is true.  Note the double-equals "==",
which is true if the two values are equal (remember that the single
equal "=" sets a variable to a value, which is not what we want to do here).
If that's true, the 2nd statement "output1.setCommandedState(OFF)" will
be executed, otherwise it will be skipped.
<P>
You can ask the current state of a sensor using "sensor1x1.getKnownState()";
the possible values are "ACTIVE", "INACTIVE", "UNKNOWN" and "ERROR".
<P>
You can set an output using "output1.setCommandedState(OFF)", where the
possible states are either "ON" or "OFF".  "THROWN" is the same as "ON", 
and "CLOSED" is the same as "OFF".

<h2>Writing to the screen</h2>

There are four ways to write to the screen, and also optionally to log files:
<PRE>
   log.debug("message");   // debugging messages suppressed in normal operation
   log.info("message");    // routine messages that don't imply an error
   log.warn("message");    // something odd happened, but it might not be an error
   log.error("message");   // something happened that's certainly bad
</PRE>
The double-slash "//" means the rest of the line is a comment.
There are multiple type of messages so we can control what's actually
printed to the screen or log from a outside the program.  (For an example
of this, look at the default.lcf file in every JMRI distribution).  Normally,
only warn() or error() messages are shown to the user, but during development
it's often convenient to also show the info or even the debugging messages.
