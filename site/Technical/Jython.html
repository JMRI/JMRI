<h1>Jython access to JMRI tools</h1>

This page discusses access to the JMRI libraries from Jython, a Java version
of Python.  This capability is being actively developed, and this 
page will not always be up-to-date.
<P>
See also the 
<A HREF="index.html">base page for technical documentation</a>.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python<a/> is a widely used scripting language that's
available on many types of computers.  A Java-based varient, called
<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Jython</a>,
has been integrated with JMRI to make it easy to control a model railroad
from the command line of a computer.

For example, you can run the JmriDemo application with a
Jython command line, which is then available for manipulating
objects like turnouts and sensors:

<PRE>
% ./jmrithon
execFileJython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
(Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> execfile("JmriDemo.py")
     0 JmriDemo.JMRIdemo                     INFO  - program starts [main]
 11109 JmriDemo.JMRIdemo                     INFO  - main initialization done [main]

>>> turnouts.newTurnout("LT1", "")
jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnTurnout@1a8f49

>>> turnouts.getTurnout("LT1").getCommandedState()
1

>>> lt1 = turnouts.getTurnout("LT1")

>>> lt1.setCommandedState(CLOSED)

>>> lt1.commandedState
2

>>> lt1.commandedState = THROWN

>>> lt1.commandedState
4

>>> 
</PRE>

Note that this is running a complete version of the JmriDemo application;
all of the windows and menus are presented the same way, configuration is
done by the preferences panel, etc. What the Jython connection adds is a 
command line from which you can directly manipulate things.

<BR/>This also shows some of the simplifications that
Jython and the Python language brings to using JMRI code.  The
Java member function:
<PRE>
	turnout.SetCommandedState(jmri.Turnout.CLOSED);
</PRE>
can also be expressed in Jython as:
<PRE>
	turnout.commandedState = CLOSED
</PRE>
<BR/>
This results in much easier-to-read code.
<P>
For more information on the Jython language and it's 
relations with Java, the best reference is the
book published by O'Reilly.

<H2>Setup</H2>

Jython support is not (yet) standard in JMRI.  To use this:
<OL>
<LI>You must first have a working JMRI installation.  In particular, 
start the JmriDemo application and configure it to connect to your DCC
hardware, then save, quit and restart the program.  Make sure that the
connection is working for the menu-based tools before trying to use Jython.
<LI>Download and install Jython from
<A HREF="http://www.jython.org">http://www.jython.org</a>.  
Development is using the 2.1 version, so you
might want to start with that.  On MacOS X, the installer does not run, so you
have to manually invoke the jython_21.class file; see the MacOS X note
on the jython web site.  Make sure the installation is complete
by invoking jython from the command line:
<PRE>
   % jython
   Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
   Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> ^D
</PRE>
If that works, your installation is OK. If not, you'll have to
fix the installation before you'll be able to do the next step.
<LI>
Now you just have to have the required classes in the CLASSPATH
used when jython starts up.  The required list in Unix syntax is:
<PRE>
  setenv CLASSPATH .:jmri.jar:lib/log4j.jar:lib/collections.jar:lib/crimson.jar:lib/jdom-jdk11.jar
</PRE>
<BR/>
To save typing, the "jmrithon" script is available for use on Linux
and MacOS X systems:
<PRE>
  % ./jmrithon
  Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
  Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> ^D
</PRE>
<BR/>The first time you run this, you'll get a number of messages
about "processing modified jar"; these can be ignored, as they are normal.
</OL>

<H2>Using Jython directly</h2>

This section of the page is a pile of useful information on
controlling JMRI from Jython directly. 
<P>
Note that you don't need most of this when running the 
JmriDemo.py or similar scripts, as they handle starting a 
complete application.

<h3>Initialization</h3>

JMRI uses the LogJ system extensively for logging information
during program execution.  To configure that when running with
Jython, you should do:
<PRE>
  import org
  org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.configure("default.lcf")
</PRE>
before starting any of the JMRI classes.  The "default.lcf"
is the name of the logging control file to be used; it can
be omitted.
<P>
To make JMRI classes available, you have to do:
<PRE>
  import jmri
</PRE>
As currently set up, this does not run any initialization
code to start the hardware connections, etc. 
One way to do that is to load a configuration file, perhaps one
you've created earlier via the JmriDemo preferences panel:
<PRE>
  import java.io
  configfile = java.io.File(jmri.jmrit.XmlFile.prefsDir()+"JmriDemoConfig2.xml")
  jmri.InstanceManager.setConfigureManager(jmri.configurexml.ConfigXmlManager())
  jmri.InstanceManager.configureManagerInstance().load(configfile)
</PRE>
to activate the JMRI classes and connect to your layout 
hardware. "JmriDemoConfig2.xml" is the name of the configuration
file from the JmriDemo program; you can use another name if desired.
The configuration file controls the layout connection, and any other
options that may have been set when it was created.

<P>
Alternately, if you want to start the complete JmriDemo application,
including the menu bar, spash screen, etc, you can do:
<PRE>
 import apps
 apps.JmriDemo.JMRIdemo.main([]) 
</PRE>
<P>
This will start the program, including its startup configuration, etc.

<P>
To simplify this startup even further, you can do:
<PRE>
 execfile("JmriDemo.py")
</PRE>
to invoke these commands. 

<h3>Access to JMRI</h3>

JMRI uses the factory-pattern extensively to get access to 
objects.  In Java this results in verbose code like
<PRE>
   Turnout t2 = InstanceManager.turnoutManagerInstance().newTurnout("LT2", "turnout 2");
   t2.SetCommandedState(Turnout.THROWN)
</PRE>
Jython simplifies that by allowing us to provide useful variables,
and by shortening certain method calls.
<P>
To get access to the SignalHead, Sensor and Turnout managers and
the CommandStation object,
several shortcut variables are defined in the .py scripts listed above:
<UL>
<LI>sensors
<LI>signals
<LI>turnouts
<LI>dcc
</UL>
These can then be referenced directly in Jython as
<PRE>
   t2 = turnouts.provideTurnout("12");
   
   dcc.
</PRE>
Note that the variable t2 did not need to be declared.
<P>
Juthon provides a shortcut for parameters that have 
been defined with Java-Bean-like get and set methods:
<PRE>
   t2.SetCommandedState(Turnout.THROWN)
</PRE>
can be written as
<PRE>
   t2.commandedState = THROWN
</PRE>
where the assignment is actually invoking the set method.
Also note that THROWN was defined when running the Python script
at startup; CLOSED, ACTIVE, INACTIVE, RED, YELLOW and GREEN are
also defined.
<P>
A similar mechanism can be used to check the state of something:
<PRE>
>>> print sensors.provideSensor("3").knownState == ACTIVE 
1
>>> print sensors.provideSensor("3").knownState == INACTIVE
0
</PRE>
Note that Jython uses "1" to indicate true, and "0" to indicate
false, so sensor 3 is currently active in this example
<P>
You can also directly invoke methods, e.g. to send a DCC
packet to the rails you type:
<PRE>   
   dcc.sendPacket([0x01, 0x03, 0xbb], 4) 
</PRE>
This sends that three-byte packet four times, and then returns to the
command line.
<P>
To exit, either ^C from the command line, or use the exit
command from the menu.  

<H2>Using Python for signal logic and automation</h2>

The existing JMRI 
"<A HREF="../Automat.html">Automat</a>"
classes provide hooks for user layout automation, including signalling.
But they require that you write Java code and compile it into .class files.
<P>
The 
<A HREF="doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/JythonAutomaton.html">JythonAutomaton</a>
class is intended to make it easier to code custom layout automation, as
it will allow you to invoke a Jython script.  Once it's integrated into
the configuration process, you'll be able to code your automation in one
or more .py files, and have the program start running them at startup.

<h2>Next steps</h2>
We're just learning how to best to integrate JMRI and Python, so there
are still some basic mysteries.
<h3>Initialization and modules</h3>
The idea of Python "modules" isn't yet 
clearly understood.  There are three ways to start the program via 
a .py file:
<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>
  % ./jmrithon
  Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
  Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import JmriDemo
</PRE>
This works, in the sense that the program starts up. But the
convenience methods are all in the JmriDemo namespace:
<PRE>
  >>> turnouts.newTurnout("LT1","")
  Traceback (innermost last):
    File "<console>", line 1, in ?
  NameError: turnouts

  >>> JmriDemo.turnouts.newTurnout("LT1","")
  jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnTurnout@36b91b
</PRE>
which makes for significantly more typing later.
And it's confusing, because depending on whether you started
JmriDemo, DecoderPro or some other application, the names will
be different.
<LI>
<PRE>
  % ./jmrithon
  >>>  execfile("JmriDemo.py")
</PRE>
or the simpler form
<PRE>
  % ./jmrithon -JmriDemo.py
</PRE>

This looks somewhat ugly, as it's not using the normal Python
modules technique.  But the convenience methods are
in the top-level name space:
<PRE>
  turnouts.newTurnout("LT1", "")
</PRE>
<BR>
We need to understand whether this is a real issue.  Most Python
programs don't use that top-level namespace, and there's probably
a good reason!
</OL>
We need to understand how the developers of Jython intended this
to be done.

<h3>Termination</h3>
Once the JMRI main thread (or Swing GUI thread?) has started, 
^D is not sufficient to exist the program.  You have to select
"Quit" from the actual file menu, or ^C the program.
<P>
It would be good to understand what's preventing the program 
from stopping when it gets the ^D.
