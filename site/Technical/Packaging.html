<H2>JMRI Packaging</H2>

This page discusses how JMRI is packaged for various systems.
<P>
The JMRI collection of classes are normally distributed in a "jmri.jar" file, 
which contains only the JMRI classes.  These require other publicly-available
Java classes, which are normally distributed separately as jar files.  
The exact set of jar files varies from platform to platform, and the Windows
version is packaged with both the JMRI and external classes packaged in a 
single .jar file.

<h3>Macintosh</h3>

<h4>MacOS "Classic", 8.1 through 9.X</h4>

The main jmri.jar file contains all of our code.  The "JMRI demo" application
configures Java, and then starts the JMRI code.
<P>
External jar files are included in the 
lib folder in the distribution. These are expected to be somewhat stable
so we've put them in a separate place to make updaters easy to create.
Note that we don't have any updaters yet.
<P>
To get communications support, we distribute javax.comm.MRJ.jar
as part of a JMRI distribution. This file is specific to MacOS
Classic.
<P>
We also distribute swingall.jar, as Java Swing is not installed
by default with MRJ (Macintosh Runtime for Java).
<P>

<h4>MacOS X</h4>

The main jmri.jar file contains all of our code.  The "JMRI demo" application
configures Java, and then starts the JMRI code.
<P>
External jar files are included in the 
lib folder in the distribution. These are expected to be somewhat stable
so we've put them in a separate place to make updaters easy to create.
Note that we don't have any updaters yet.
<P>
Because the Mac Classic and MacOS X distributions are combined into one,
the lib subdirectory contains the swingall.jar and javax.comm.MRJ.jar
files.  These are not included in the CLASSPATH, hence not used, when the
MacOS X app is launched.

<h3>OS/2</h3>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<h3>Windows</h3>

We don't know how to handle the class path consistently across all the varients
of Windows.  We deal with this by including external classes within a single
.jar file which we distribute.  Specifically, we include the contents of these
separate files from other platforms:
<UL>
<LI>jmri.jar
<LI>xerxes.jar
<LI>log4j.jar
<LI>jdom-jdk11.jar
<LI>collections.jar
</UL>

The jmriwin95.jar file contains all these. Its manifest is configured so
you can just double click to launch it.  Unfortunately, in that case the
log information (warnings, errors, etc) is not displayed.  To see that
information, use the "java -jar jmriwin95.jar" command in a DOS 
window.
