<h1>LocoNet addressing</h1>

LocoNet systems address input sensors and output turnouts using numbers.
This page talks about how those numbers are defined in JMRI, and how they relate
to the numbers in other systems.

<h2>Addressing LocoNet sensors in JMRI</h2>

Inside packets on the LocoNet, sensors are addressed with numbers from 0 to 4095.
JMRI uses this numbers for addresses, so the first sensor is number 0.
<P>
The simplest way to find the 
right number for a given block is to open a "LocoNet monitor" window, and drop a 
locomotive onto the block you're interested in.  You'll see the 
LocoNet message, complete with number, in the window that looks 
something like this:
<PRE>
   General sensor input report: contact 161 (DS54 20 ch1 Sw  input)
        (BDL16 10 A2) is Lo
</PRE>
The contact number, 161 in this case, is what you want.
<P>

<h2>Addressing LocoNet turnouts in JMRI</h2>

Inside packets on the LocoNet, output turnouts are addressed with numbers from 0 to 4095.
Throttles, however, address these with numbers from 1 to 4096. To avoid user
confusion, JMRI uses the same numbering as the throttles:  1 to 4096.
<P>
Note that the LocoNet monitor panel shows the contents of the LocoNet packets, hence
0 to 4095.  Yes, that's confusing, but there has to be some confusion somewhere, given
the way this was set up.
