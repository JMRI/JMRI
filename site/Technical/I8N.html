This page discusses how the JMRI libraries handle internationalization.
For more information on JMRI, see the
<A HREF="../index.html">main JMRI page</a>.

<P>
The JMRI libraries are intended to be usable world-wide.
To make this possible, they make use of the "internationalization"
features built into the Java language and libraries.

<P>
You can also use this feature to customize your copy of JMRI.  For info
on this, please see the 
<A HREF="#custom">customization section</a>.

<h2>Use of Locales</h2>

JMRI uses the default Locale for locating internationalization
information.  That means that JMRI will present its user interface
in the language Java has defined as the default for that computer.

<P>
Locals are specified by a language, and optionally a country. The
language is a two letter lower-case code; the country is a two letter
upper case code.  "en" is English, "fr" is French, "de" is German, 
and "de_CH" is German as spoken in Switzerland.
<P>
When Java looks for resources (see below), it searches first for
a file with the complete current locale at the end of it's name 
(e.g. foo_de_CH.properties). If that fails, it tries for a file
ending in just the current locale's language:  foo_de.properties.
And if that fails, it goes to the defaults with no suffix:  foo.properties.
<P>
By installing appropriate files and allowing the user to select 
a default locale (as part of the advanced preferences), we can
customize the program to different countries and languages.

<h2>Use of Resource Bundles</h2>
The text for menus, buttons and similiar controls is contained in
property files, which are accessed via the Resource Bundle mechanism
of java.util.
<P>
For example, the property file that's used to configure the Roster
panel contains lines like:
<PRE>
FieldRoadName       = Road Name:
</PRE>
To the left of the equal sign is the resource name that the program uses
to refer to the string; to the right of the equals sign is the
string that will be displayed.
<p>
By convention, resouce names for GUI elements start with one of
<OL>
<LI>Field - for a visible field, e.g. label, on the GUI
<LI>Button - for a GUI button
<LI>Menu - the name of a top-level menu
<LI>MenuItem - an item in a menu (may be a nested item)
<LI>ToolTip - contents of a tooltip
<LI>Error - for an error message displayed as part of the GUI
</ol>
Other resources are named so as not to conflict with these.
<H2>Adapting to a new language</h2>
The primary steps to adapt JMRI to a new language are:
<UL>
<LI>Create new versions of the .properties files to change the language
of the GUI controls.
<LI>Optionally, create new versions of GIF images used for logos
and icons.
</UL>
<P>
To get a clean copy of the properties files from CVS, do:
<PRE>
   cvs checkout properties
</PRE>
(For more info on using CVS, please see the 
<A HREF="index.html#cvs">CVS section of the Technical page</a>.)
<P>
Then, make copies of the files with suffix for your
new locale.  On a Unix machine, this would be:
<PRE>
  cd apps
  cp AppsBundle.properties AppsBundle_xy.properties
  cp AppsConfigBundle.properties AppsConfigBundle_xy.properties
</PRE>
and so on.  You can then edit those files to enter text in 
your own language.
<P>
Languages that involve non-roman letters require some
extra care; please see the 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/intl/faq.html">Sun internationalization FAQ</a>
for more info on how to include those characters in your property files.
<P>
That adapts the program itself, at least as far as we've 
"internationalized" it.  (That's an ongoing effort, with 
more and more parts of the program able to be customized 
in each release).  
<P>
You may also want to provide additional language-specific 
features for users:
<UL>
<LI>Create new decoder XML files in the new language. (Although we're currently working on a method to greatly reduce the effort that would take)
<LI>Create a copy of the website and manuals.
<LI>Create new help files.
</UL>

<h2>English-only resources</h2>
Some parts of JMRI remain English only due to our developer population.
In particular, comments and variable names in the code should remain in
English, as should messages sent to the logging system.  
<P>
As JMRI is open source, it would be OK to take a copy of the source
and translate it.  Apart from being a lot of work, this would effectively
isolate that copy from the rapid pace of improvements to the main code.


<h2>Customizing JMRI for your own use</h2>
<A id="custom"/>

You can use the internationalization feature to customize the program
for your own purposes.  This section describes how to do that, assuming 
that your native language is English.
<P>
Basically, you're going to create an "English" version of the program
text that gets used in front of the "default" version.  We do this so
that new versions of the program, which might change the default 
version, don't overwrite your changes.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Obtain a copy of the appropriate set of "properties" files.
Note that you really do need the set of files that's consistent
with the version of JMRI you're using.
There are several ways to do this:
<UL>
<LI>
Look for a "properties files" download on the 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=26788">JMRI downloads</a>
page.  For example, the files for JMRI version 1.2.5 can
be downloaded via
<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/properties.1.2.5.zip?download">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/properties.1.2.5.zip?download</a>.
<P>This will give you a "classes" directory, which should be placed
in the same directory as the jmri.jar file.
<LI>
You can get these by checking out the "properties" module from
cvs with "cvs checkout properties" (see the
<A HREF="index.html#cvs">CVS information</a> on the
technical page for background on how to use CVS if you're not 
familiar with it.  The steps are:
<ol>
<LI>Create a directory named "classes" in the same directory
as your "jmri.jar" file.  E.g. on MacOS X or linux:
<PRE>
	mkdir classes
</PRE>
<LI>Change to that directory:
<PRE>
	cd classes
</PRE>

<LI>Check out the properties module for the version you're interested in:
<PRE>
	cvs co -r Release-1-2-5 properties
</PRE>

</ol>

</ul>


<LI>
Now, you have to find the correct file to edit, and the correct
string within it.
Some of the more useful files are:
<ul>
<LI>classes/jmri/jmrit/roster/JmritRosterBundle.properties for the 
labels on the "Roster" panel and similar.
<LI>classes/jmri/jmrit/JmritToolsBundle.properties for many
of the Tools menu names
<LI>classes/jmri/jmrix/JmrixSystemsBundle.properties for the names
of the DCC systems that appear in the Systems menu
</ul>
<br>
You're looking for a line that contains the string you
want to change.  For example, the 
classes/jmri/jmrit/roster/JmritRosterBundle.properties file
contains the line
<PRE>
FieldRoadName       = Road Name:
</PRE>
To the left of the equal sign is the name that the program uses
to refer to the string; to the right of the equals sign is the
string that will be displayed.
<LI>
Once you've found the right file, make a copy of it with a "_en" 
appended to the name.  For example, make a file
classes/jmri/jmrit/roster/JmritRosterBundle_en.properties
that's a copy of the classes/jmri/jmrit/roster/JmritRosterBundle.properties
file.  Because of the way that Java searches these files, this
new file will be found before the original.
<LI>
Change the strings you want to change, and (this part is important)
<i>remove the rest of the lines</i>!  This will greatly reduce the
changes that you'll have problems with a later version of JMRI 
conflicting with your changes.
<LI>
Restart a JMRI program, and see if your changes appear in the user interface.
</OL>

If that doesn't work, please get in touch so that we can help you find the
problem and improve the instructions.
