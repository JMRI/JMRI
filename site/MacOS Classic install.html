   <title>Installing on Macintosh</title>

<body>

<P>
<h3><a id="Mac8">Macintosh MacOS 8 and 9 information:</a></h3>

We test these programs on a 90MHz Power Macintosh 7100 with 32MB of memory.  This is about
the minimum needed; it works, but is quite slow. Both a faster CPU and more
memory are recommended. 
A screen size of 800x600 or larger is strongly recommended.

<H3>To install</h3>
This application should run with any recent release of the Macintosh Runtime for Java (MRJ).  
MRJ requires Mac OS 8.1 or later.  
If you don't have Java installed on your Macintosh, or even if your're
not sure, double click on the "MRJ 2.2.5 Install.smi" file to install it.
<P>
You need to have the Java Swing and Java communications libraries installed.
Install these by double-clinking on the "JavaLibsInstaller-2" file and following the instructions.
<P>
Be sure to run both of these installers before installing DecoderPro.
<P>
Download the 1.0 version from 
<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.1.0.hqx">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.1.0.hqx</a>
and unpack it. This will create a "JMRI" folder.
<P>
To install, you just have to move the JMRI folder to where you want it 
on your computer.
<P>
Once those packages are installed, you can
run the program from the CD by double-clicking on the "DecoderPro",
"LocoTools" or "JmriDemo" application icons
in the JMRI folder.
