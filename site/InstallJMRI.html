<h2>Installing JMRI</h2>

This page describes the installation options for the JMRI demo application.

<P><A HREF="#SimpleMac">Simple Macintosh install</A>
<P><A HREF="#SimpleWin">Simple Windows install</A>
<P><A HREF="#SimpleOS2">Simple OS/2 install</A>
<P><A HREF="#SimpleLinux">Simple Linux install</A>

<P>
For information on Java, see the 
<A HREF="Java/InstallJava.html">Java installation</A> page.
Why would you want anything other than a simple installation?
The simple installs download several large files, and you might not need
all of it.  Particularly if you already have JMRI or other
Java applications installed on your machine, you might want to update
just parts of your existing install.
In that case, you should read the 
<A HREF="background">background information</A>
then the specifics for your system:

<P><A HREF="#MacDetails">Macintosh details</A>
<P><A HREF="#WinDetails">Windows details</A>
<P><A HREF="#OS2Details">OS/2 details</A>
<P><A HREF="#LinuxDetails">Linux details</A>

<h3><A NAME="SimpleMac"></A>Simple Macintosh install</h3>
A Macintosh self-extracting archive is available.  When you
download and run it, it creates a folder containing the 
double-clickable application
and various support files.  
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.demo.0.7A.hqx">Download the archive</A>
<LI>Find the "JMRI.demo.0.7.sea" file and double-click it to 
expand the folder.
<LI>You should now have a "JMRI.demo.0.7" folder.  
The installation is complete.
</UL>
To run the program, open the JMRI.demo.0.7 folder and double-click
on the "JMRI demo" icon.

<h4>Possible problems</h4>
If after the download you're left with a "JMRI.demo.0.7A.hqx"
file, rather than a "JMRI.demo.0.7.sea" file, your browser is not 
configured to expand files in "binhex" format.  You'll need a program 
like StuffIt Expander, UnStuff or similar to convert this file to 
a self-expanding archive.  Drag the JMRI.demo.0.7A.hqx file to the 
icon for one of those programs, which should convert it to 
a JMRI.demo.0.7.sea file.

<h4>Hardware requirements</h4>

JMRI is primarily developed on a PowerBook 400MHz. 
We test that it
runs on a PowerMac 7200/90  (90MHz) with 40MB of memory. Performance on that
machine is poor, but usable: Some windows take several seconds to open, and certain file
operations take too long.

We use a USB Macintosh connected to a Keyspan PDA Adapter to 
provide the serial port; for information please see 
http://jmri.sourceforge.net/DigiTrax/KeyspanAdapters/KeyspanUSB.html.  
Its not known if a standard Macintosh RS422 serial port will work directly 
with an MS100; if you have a pre-USB Macintosh and want to use this demo, please 
contact us for more information.


<h3><A NAME="SimpleWin"></A>Simple Windows install</h3>

A .zip format archive is available.  When you
download and expand it, it creates a folder containing the 
application script
and various support files.  
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.demo.0.7.zip">Download the archive</A>
<LI>Find the  "JMRI.demo.0.7.zip" file and expand it using
WinZIP or a similar program.
<LI>You should now have a "JMRI.demo.0.7" folder.  
The installation is complete.
</UL>
<P>
We don't have a startup script for Windows yet, so to start the program type:
<PRE>
  set CLASSPATH=lib/log4j.jar;lib/collections.jar;lib/xerces.jar;lib/jdom-jdk11.jar
  java -jar jmri.jar 
</PRE>
Note this assumes that Swing and the Java communications package
are already installed on your computer. If so, you can delete the
large lib/swingall.jar file.

<h3><A NAME="SimpleOS2"></A>Simple OS2 install</h3>

A .zip format archive is available.  When you
download and expand it, it creates a folder containing the 
application script
and various support files.  
<UL>
<LI>Install the swing and javacomm packages from the IBM web site.
<LI><A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.demo.0.7.zip">Download the archive</A>
<LI>Find the  "JMRI.demo.0.7.zip" file and expand it using
<PRE>
  PKZIP -extr -dir JMRI.demo.0.7
</PRE>
<LI>You should now have a "JMRI.demo.0.7" directory.  
The installation is complete.
</UL>

The install creates a large lib/swingall.jar file which is not needed on OS/2, so 
you can delete it without problems.
<P>
The provided JmriDemo.CMD script will start the program. Type
<PRE>
   JmriDemo
</PRE>
in the JMRI.demo.0.7 directory.

<h3><A NAME="SimpleLinux"></A>Simple Linux install</h3>

A .tar.gz format archive is available.  When you
download and expand it, it creates a folder containing the 
application script
and various support files.  
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.demo.0.7.tar.gz">Download the archive</A>
<LI>Find the  "JMRI.demo.0.7.tar.gz" file and expand it using
<PRE>
  gunzip JMRI.demo.0.7.tar.gz
</pre>
<LI>You should now have a "JMRI.demo.0.7.tar" file.  Expand it using the command
<PRE>
  tar -xf JMRI.demo.0.7.tar
</PRE>
<LI>You should now have a "JMRI.demo.0.7" directory. 
Note that you should run the program from 
this directory.
You can move that directory to 
another location if needed.
</UL>

Unfortunately, we don't yet have clear instructions for creating the 
Java communications package needed for Linux.  There is some information
available at
<A HREF="http://www.interstice.com/~kevinh/linuxcomm.html">http://www.interstice.com/~kevinh/linuxcomm.html</A>.
You have to follow those instructions to configure your linux machine, and 
then edit the JMRI.demo.0.7/JmriDemo.tcsh
file to include the files you've created.
<P>
To start the program, type:
<PRE>
  ./JmriDemo.tcsh
</PRE>
from the JMRI.demo.0.7 directory.

<h3><A NAME="background"></A>background information</h3>
Note that this structure described here
started in the 0.7 release of JMRI.  If you have
something earlier than that installed, you'd be better off just erasing the
old version and starting with a simple install.
When we create later releases of JMRI, we'll provide the links to
download just the changed parts.
<P>
The JMRI-specific code is in a Java archive file called "jmri.jar".
This file changes from one JMRI release to the next. 
<P>There are also several .jar files in the lib subdirectory that
provide libraries needed by the JMRI demo program. When you do a 
simple install, these are included. 
They generally do not change from one release to another of the JMRI code.
Depending on what's already on
your system, you might not need dedicated copies of these:
	<UL>
	<LI>log4j.jar - This provides a configurable logging and error 
			reporting system. It allows us to capture debugging
			info when somebody has a problem, without creating
			large log files during normal operation. For more
			information, see the 
			<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">log4j home page</A>.
	<LI>jdom-jdk11.jar - Lightweight toolkit for reading and writing XML files.
			In release 0.7, this is only needed by the symbolic programmer
			tool, but its so useful that other tools will be using it soon.
			For more information, see the
			<A HREF="http://www.jdom.org">JDOM home page</A>.
	<LI>xerces.jar - An XML parser used for our configuration files.
			This is a commonly used utility. If you have other Java
			programs installed, you might already have this.
	<LI>collections.jar - Part of recent versions of Java, this file
			provides a powerful set of collection classes.  You might
			not need this file if you have Java 1.3 or later installed.
			Its small, so we include it in our distributions.
	<LI>swingall.jar - Part of recent versions of Java, this file
			provides the Swing graphical user interface.  You might 
			have this (or the equivalent swingnew.jar) file
			already installed as part of Java, in which case you don't
			need this one. Macintosh systems before MacOS X don't generally
			have this, so we include it in the Macintosh (.hqx) distribution.
			Unfortunately, swingall.jar is a 4MB file.
	<LI>javax.comm.MRJ.jar - A Macintosh-specific implementation of 
			the Java communications classes. Only Macintosh computers
			use this file. Other distributions don't have it.
	<LI>junit.jar - Part of the development tests, we will send you this
			file if needed for debugging.  Most distributions don't have it.
	</UL>

<P>The "xml" subdirectory is also updated from one JMRI release to the
next.  To pick up the most recent decoder configurations, etc, you
need to update this directory. Be careful to preserve any files you've
modified (and that you've not contributed, so that they appear in the
distribution).

<P>To summarize, to update to a new JMRI release, you need to:
<UL>
<LI>Get a new jmri.jar file and drop it into the distribution directory.
This updates the program itself.
<LI>Update the contents of the xml folder/directory.  This updates data files
used by the program.
</UL>
<P>For future releases, we plan to provide "updaters" with just the changed files.

<h3><A NAME="MacDetails"></A>Macintosh details</h3>

<h4>MacOS 8.1 through 9.2</h4>

If you want to make a Java archive (.jar) file available to any
program on your Mac, drop it into the MRJClasses folder.  Its located
inside a set of folders:
<PRE>
 System Folder
    Extensions
       MRJ Libraries
          MRJClasses
</PRE>
A single swingall.jar file in that folder, for example, will serve 
all applications that need it. You can then remove it from the lib
folder of the JMRI distribution.

<h4>MacOS X</h4>
There is currently no implementation of the Java communications toolbox for
MacOS X.  This means that the JMRI demo can run natively in MacOS X or under
Classic, but neither can communicate with the actual layout.
