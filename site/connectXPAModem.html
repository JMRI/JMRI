<h2>Connectiong to an XPressNEt based DCC System using the XPA and a modem</h2>

<P>
We have developed an alternative method for connecting to an XPressNet based 
system which should prove to be more cost effective on XPressNet based 
systems that do not support programming or feedback via the LI100,LI100F, 
or LI101F computer interfaces, or for those who are interested in 
experimenting with computer control, but don't need all the features 
supported by the Lenz interfaces</p>
<p>
This system uses the Lenz XPressNet Phone Adapter and a Hayes Compatible 
modem to provide control of locomotives and stationary 
decoders.

<h2>Connecting to an XPressNet Based DCC system with the XPA and Modem</h2>

<P>
Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.  This opens 
automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select it from
the "Edit" menu.  
<P>
Select "XPA-Modem" from the top selection box. You can then select the proper 
serial port in the second selection box.  
<P>
The baud rate selection box should default to 9600 baud.  At this point 
in time, this can not be changed.
<P>
The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to select
how the program will look.  
"Metal" is the native Java look available on all types. 
Other choices will vary with your computer type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" 
and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X
respectively.
<P>
In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer format. You can
override this each time you open the programmer, so this is here just for convenience.
<P>
Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to quit, click "Yes".
<P>
Restart the program. You should be up and running.
