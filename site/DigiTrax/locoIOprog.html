<h2>JMRI LocoIO Programmer</h2>

The 
<A HREF="../index.html">JMRI libraries</a>
contain a number of LocoNet tools.  This page describes the 
tool for programming LocoIO boards.
<P>
A LocoIO board has 16 signal pins, each of which can be programmed
as an input or output, and to do a number of different things.
The board is also sometimes described as having 16 channels.
<P>
The channels are configured via LocoNet messages.  The LocoIO programmer
uses a table to represent the configuration of each channel.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/locoio.gif" ALT="Screen shot of LocoIO programmer" WIDTH="692" HEIGHT="324" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"><P>
<P>
The "Action" column is used to select how the 
channel behaves.  Click in a cell to be given a menu
of available choices. 
Currently, the choices are:
<UL>
<LI>
<dfn>"Toggle switch controls turnout"</dfn><P>
Generate a OPC_SW_REQ to close/throw a turnout
when a toggle switch changes state.
When the input goes high, a "close" command is
sent; when the input goes low, a "throw" command is sent.
The channel configuration value is 0x0F.

<LI>
<dfn>"Input low flips turnout"</dfn><P>
Generate a OPC_SW_REQ LocoNet message
when the input goes low.  This
is intended for use with a momentary pushbutton.
The command sent will alternate the  position
of the addressed turnout or signal; if "close" 
was last sent, a "throw" will be sent now and vice-versa.
The channel configuration value is 0x2F.

<LI>
<dfn>"Input high flips turnout"</dfn><P>
Generate a OPC_SW_REQ LocoNet message 
when the input goes high.This
is intended for use with a momentary pushbutton.
The command sent will alternate the  position
of the addressed turnout or signal; if "close" 
was last sent, a "throw" will be sent now and vice-versa.
The channel configuration value is 0x6F.

<LI>
<dfn>"Status message sets output"</dfn><P>
Drive an output from OPC_INPUT_REP 
input status messages on the LocoNet.
The output goes high when an "input high" message
is received, and goes low when an "input low" message 
is received. These messages are also used
for block occupancy status; the output will go high
when the block is occupied, and low when its empty.
The channel configuration value is 0XC0.

<LI>
<dfn>"Turnout close cmd sets output"</dfn><P>
Drive an output on 
the LocoIO board from received OPC_SW_REQ commands.
The channel configuration value is 0x80. This adjusts the address field
to look for a command that sets the turnout "closed".

<LI>
<dfn>"Turnout throw cmd sets output"</dfn><P>
Drive an output on 
the LocoIO board from received OPC_SW_REQ commands.
The channel configuration value is 0x80. This adjusts the address field
to look for a command that sets the turnout "thrown".

</UL>
<p>
The "Hex Value1,Value2" column sets the address that the
LocoIO board will use for LocoNet communications.
This contains a hexadecimal representation 
of the two configuration values described in John Jabour's
LocoIO programming guide.
You generally won't need
to figure out these addresses, as the "capture" buttons
will find them for you.

<P>
We're also planning to have a "User Address" column
that will show the human-readable address for turnouts and sensors.
For turnout messages, this is the same number that 
you would use on your throttle.  For block occupancy
messages, this is the block number. For input status
messages, this is the input number, which is twice the 
number of the associated turnout, plus one if its
a DS54 "switch" input.  

<P>
The "Read" button reads from the LocoIO board via the LocoNet
and shows the current configuration for that pin.
The "Write" button stores the current settings to the LocoIO board.

<P>
The "Capture" button provides an easier way to 
find a needed LocoNet address.  Configure the input and output
for a particular pin, then press the capture button.
The address in the next LocoNet message of the right type will 
be put in the address column.  
<P>
For example, if you
have a channel set to act when a "Turnout closed status message"
is received, press the capture button and use your
throttle to command the correct turnout closed.  
<P>
As another
example, if the channel is configured to send a 
"Send throw turnout command", press the capture button and use your
throttle to command the correct turnout thrown.

<P>
At the bottom of the table are some general controls.  The 
LocoIO address field sets the address of the board being programmed.
LocoIO processors are sent with an address of 1051 programmed; see
below for how to change that.
Address "0" is a global address which any LocoIO board will
respond to; make sure you have only one connected when you use that!
<P>
The "Set address" button will use the global address to configure a
specific address into a LocoIO board.  Again, make sure you have
only one connected. (This button is disabled in the current
version while we sort out a problem)
<P>
The "Open..." and "Save..." buttons are not yet implemented. They will
eventually allow you to load and store configuration files.
<P>
The "Read All" and "Write All" buttons 
read or write all of the channels, and are just a convenience.

<P>Status messages during capture/read/write are displayed at the
bottom of the window.  If no response is heard from the LocoIO
unit, the operation will be retried
until it succeeds or until you close the window.

<A id="demo"><h2>Getting the programmer</h2></a>

A complete version of this tool is available for download.
It will work on many 
Macintosh, Windows, Linux and OS/2 computers.  The JMRI libraries
will work with NCE or Digitrax equipment, but of course the LocoNet
tools only work with a Digitrax LocoNet.
The demo program also contains several other
<A  HREF="../LocoTools.html">LocoNet tools</a>,
and a complete version of the
<A HREF="../PaneProg/index.html">Decoder Pro</a> 
decoder programming tool.
We call this a "demo" because 
<UL>
<LI>JMRI is a work in progress, and the demo program should not be considered complete
<LI>The project is creating libraries, which we hope people will use to 
create their own layout automation programs.  This program is just a demo
of the tools and capabilities
</UL>
Note that JMRI is free software, and there is no "pay" version to go with the
demo!
<P>
For more information on
how to download and install the demo, whether it will run 
on your computer, etc, please see the 
<A HREF="../README.html">README file</A>.
<P>
JMRI is an open-source project, so you can get the entire source code at any time
via the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/">Project page</A>. For more
information, please see the
<A HREF="../index.html">main JMRI page<a/>.

<h2>Running the tools</h2>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../README.html">Download and install</a> the program.
<LI>Start the LocoTools program.
<LI>From the input menu, select either "MS100" or "LocoBuffer", depending on 
how your layout is connected.  Then select the serial port, and click "open".
<li>Select a tool from the "LocoNet" menu.
<LI><A HREF="mailto:jake@physics.berkeley.edu">Send us feedback</a>
on how to make this better.

<h3>Digitrax-specific information</h3>
As a convenience for people using JRMI with Digitrax systems, we've got a directory of
