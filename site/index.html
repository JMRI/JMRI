   <title>JMRI: A Java Model Railroad Interface</title>

This page is _really_ still under construction! If you can help us make it a better page, please

The JMRI project is building tools for model railroad computer control.  We 
want it to be usable to as many people as possible, so we're building it 
in Java to run anywhere, and we're trying to make it independent of specific
hardware systems. 
Like the CMRI system before it, JMRI is intended as a jumping-off point for 
hobbyists who want to control their layouts from a computer without having to 
create an entire system from scratch.<P>

To do this, we've split the problem into two parts with an interface in-between:
<UL>
<LI>"Below" the interface lies code that connects to specific layout hardware.  Our initial
work has been with Digitrax&tm; systems, as they provide a lot of functionality already
and really good support is available.  But we're working on connections to other systems.
<LI>"Above" the interface are the cool tools that people want. Our first examples are
programmers for DCC decoders and simple layout controls.  The hope is that we can develop
better and better tools that still will work on lots of type of computers, with lots
of types of layouts.
</UL>

The long-term strategy is to:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Create a set of publically available common interfaces for model railroad control code, suitable
    for use with any type of layout, from any type of computer.

<LI>Demonstrate the technical feasibility of these interfaces with initial DCC-based implementations.

<LI>Encourage interoperability of layout hardware and software through the use of common interfaces.
</UL>

<P>
In the short term, we've created a demo version that can monitor a Digitrax LocoNet, control and display
turnout positions, and program decoders.  Its rough, but its a start.

If you're interested in using it with other model railroad equipment, with or without DCC, please
join in the effort.

<P>
The JMRI name is chosen to bring to mind a "Java model railroad interface", but 
to comply with the Sun licensing policy JMRI is not an acronym. <P>

<h2>Demos</h2>

JMRI is an open-source project, so you can get the entire source code at any time
via the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/">Project page</A>. If you'd
like a running demo, we have the most recent one (demo 0.6) available packaged in several forms:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.demo.0.6.hqx">JMRI.demo.0.6.hqx</A>  A binhex'd self-extracting archive for the Macintosh
<LI><A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.demo.0.6.tar.gz" >JMRI.demo.0.6.tar.gz</A>   A .tar.gz file for Linux
<LI><A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.demo.0.6.zip">JMRI.demo.0.6.zip</A>  A .zip file for OS/2
</UL>
Note that the people working on this project are really short of expertise
in Windows and Linux; project development has so far been on the Macintosh.
Only the Macintosh version is packaged so you can just click on the icon to start it; see
the README file for details of how to start the others.
If you can help us package any of these better, we'd really appreciate your
advice.<P>

The 
<A HREF="demoFiles/README.html">README file</A>
from the latest demo is also available separately.

<h3>Demo hardware requirements</h3>

The demo is developed on a USB Macintosh, which is interfaced to a layout and LocoNet via
a Keyspan PDA Adapter, DB9 to DB25 cable, and a Digitrax MS100.  
It's not yet known whether a MS100 and simple
adapter cable will work with a Macintosh that has the older style of RS422 (DIN8) serial ports.
<P>
PCs with a RS232 port should be able to connect directly to the MS100 with an appropriate cable.

<h3>Java-specific information</h3>
JMRI is written entirely in Java.  Some day, that means it will be "run anywhere",
but we're not there yet.  <P>

<A HREF="Java/InstallJava.html">Installing Java</A>: Many computers come with a usable version of Java already installed. If
your's doesn't have one, try this page for some advice.

<h3>Digitrax-specific information</h3>
As a convenience for people using JRMI with Digitrax systems, we've got a directory of 
<A HREF="DigiTrax/">Digitrax-specific information</A>:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="DigiTrax/KeyspanAdapters/KeyspanUSB.html">Using a Keyspan USB adapter for LocoNet</A>:

computers with USB ports to the MS100 Loconet interface.

This is still an early stage, and we're critically short of documentation.  But if you're interested
in working with the code, we'd love to help you get started via email, etc.
