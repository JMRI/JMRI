<h1>JMRI: A Java Model Railroad Interface</h1>
<P>
The JMRI project is building tools for model railroad computer control.  We 
want it to be usable to as many people as possible, so we're building it 
in Java to run anywhere, and we're trying to make it independent of specific
hardware systems.
<br>

<h2>News</h2>
<B>Version 1.2 is released!</B>
The updated production version 1.2 is available for download 
via the <A href="README.html">README page</a>.
Thanks and congratulations to <A HREF="Acknowledgements.html">all who contributed</a>!

<A HREF="DecoderPro/index.html"><IMG SRC="images/decoderpro.gif" align=right ALT="DecoderPro logo"></a>
<A HREF="DecoderPro/index.html"><h1>DecoderPro</h1></a>
is one of first applications built on JMRI.
<p>
This program allows you to program DCC decoders from your computer without having to
remember cryptic CV numbers and hexidecimal arithmetic. DecoderPro provides a
set of screens on which you can select the various options and values you want.
Setting up special sound or lighting effects for your locomotive has never been easier!
<p>
DecoderPro works with most of the popular DCC systems (Digitrax, EasyDCC, NCE, Lenz, Wangrow, Zimo, etc.),
and runs on both Windows, Linux, and Macintosh systems. It works via your DCC programming track,
or optionally can be used to program locomotives directly on the main track.
<p>
One of the more daunting tasks that you'll ever face is setting up a custom speed table for your
locomotive. Instead of editing individual CV values from your throttle, DecoderPro lets you use
your mouse to make adjustments in a more intuitive fashion.
<p>
If you are trying to set up custom lighting effects on a Digitrax FX decoder, instead of having to
remember what values to type in, you can choose the proper effect from a popup menu.
<p>
DecoderPro is customizable using text files, which means that supporting new decoders in the
future can be done without modifying the program at all. In fact, most of the screens for new
decoders now supported have come from folks all over the internet.
<p>
Finally, DecoderPro can also keep all your settings in a file on the computer for safe keeping.
<p>

<h2>Downloading DecoderPro</h2>
<p>
In order to download DecoderPro just visit the <A href="README.html">README page</a>, and click
on the instructions for your particular type of computer or operating systems (Windows,Linux, or Mac).
Joe Ellis has written a manual for DecoderPro, which contains a nice tutorial
and can be downloaded <A HREF="Manual/index.html">here</a>.

<H1>More Info on JMRI</H1>
<p>
Like the CMRI system before it, JMRI is intended as a jumping-off point for 
hobbyists who want to control their layouts from a computer without having to 
create an entire system from scratch.
<P>
To do this, we've split the problem into two parts with an interface in-between:
<UL>
<LI>"Above" the interface are the cool tools that people want. Our first examples are
programmers for DCC decoders and layout controls.  The hope is that we can develop
better and better tools that still will work on lots of type of computers, with lots
of types of layouts.
<LI>"Below" the interface lies code that connects to specific layout hardware.  Our initial
work was with Digitrax&reg; systems, as they provide a lot of functionality already
and really good support is available.  We also connect to NCE PowerHouse, EasyDCC, 
Lenz, Wangrow and Zimo systems, providing
the full functionality. We are certainly interested in connecting to other systems.

</UL>
The long-term strategy is to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create a set of publically available common interfaces for model railroad control code, suitable for use with any type of layout, from any type of computer.
<LI>Demonstrate the technical feasibility of these interfaces with initial DCC-based implementations.
<LI>Encourage interoperability of layout hardware and software through the use of common interfaces.
</UL>

<P>
In the short term, we've created several programs based on the JMRI
libraries to move the project along and demonstrate its capabilities.
<P>
The most popular is
<A href="PaneProg/index.html">DecoderPro, a better tool for programming decoders</a>. 
It simplifies the job of configuring complicated DCC decoders by providing 
screens on which you can select the various options and values you want.  These
screens show the exact contents of each specific decoder type. Both
the programming screens and decoder information are stored in text files, 
so you can make up new ones as desired.
You're welcome to download the full version of this program and try it; please see the 
<A href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/README.html">README file</a>
for additional information on how to install.  We welcome feedback!

<P>
We've also created a demo program to show the complete set of tools as they are developed:
<UL>
<LI> control and display turnout positions
<LI> program decoders, 
<LI> display and control layout power monitor layout traffic, etc.  
</UL>

<P>
<A HREF="Panels/CornwallRunning.html">Nick Kulp's Cornwall Road</a>
uses a JMRI-based dispatcher panel that works with his C/MRI and Digitrax systems.
For more information on the tools for building simpler control panels, please see the
<A HREF="Panels.html">Panels page</a>.  The 
<A HREF="PanelPro.html">PanelPro</a> application makes it easy to build these panels.

<P>
JMRI also provides a package
<A HREF="LocoTools.html">LocoNet-specific tools</a>
for monitoring of the LocoNet and the command station slots, and also for sending user-defined
packets. These form the basis of the 
<A HREF="LocoTools.html">LocoTools application</a> 
which you're welcome to download and use.

<P>
These programs run on Windows, Linux, Macintosh (Classic and MacOS X) and OS/2 with only small
exceptions. They work well with DCC systems from Digitrax, Intellibox, Atlas, Lenz, EasyDCC, NCE
and Wangrow, in addition to serial C/MRI systems.  This gives us some confidence in the 
approach.

<P>
If you're interested in using these libraries and tools
with other model railroad equipment, with or without DCC, please
join in the effort.
The 
<A HREF="Acknowledgements.html">acknowledgements page</a>
shows that a lot of people have been able to contribute.

<P>
The JMRI name is chosen to bring to mind a "Java model railroad interface", but 
to comply with the Sun licensing policy JMRI is not an acronym. <P>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

JMRI is an open-source project, so you can get the entire source code at any time
via the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/">Project page</A>. If you'd
prefer to download running programs, including DecoderPro, we have the most recent 
one (version 1.1) freely available for download.
You should read the 
<A HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/README.html">README page</a>
for details on what layout hardware will work, what you'll need to connect, and instructions on how 
to download, install and run the program.
<P>
In between production versions, we also produce test versions.  You might like
to try those, as new features become available there first.  They are
announced on the "JMRI users" discussion group at
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/</A>

<h2>How can you use this?</h2>

There are several different ways to use JMRI:
<OL>
<LI>Use 
<A HREF="PaneProg/index.html">DecoderPro</a> to configure your locomotive decoders and
keep a roster.
<LI>Use the <A HREF="LocoTools.html">LocoTools application</a> 
with your Digitrax command station to control your layout, monitor communications, 
configure add-on devices, etc.
<LI>You can just run the demo and use the tools it provides.  As we
add more and more, the demo becomes more useful.  But you shouldn't expect
it to be as powerful as a commercial layout management program; JMRI
isn't meant to compete directly with them.
<LI>You can use the JRMI interfaces to write programs for your own layouts.
Making this easy is an important goal.
<LI>You can write new general-purpose tools.  Although this is a little
harder than writing automation for your own layout, writing tools that other
people use can be very satisfying.
<LI>You can implement the JMRI interfaces for a new system.  
Having JMRI work with other systems is an important goal.  
Once an implementation for another system works, the general tools (e.g.
symbolic programmer, automations tools, signalling, etc) can be immediately
used.
</OL>

<h2><A ID="info"/>Further information</a></h2>

The <A href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-announce">jmri-announce</a> 
mailing list carries announcements of new versions, major changes, etc.  
This list is intended to be very low traffic; discussions, etc, should take place elsewhere.
You can subscribe
by sending the word "subscribe" in the subject or body of an email to 
<A HREF="mailto:jmri-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net">jmri-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
<P>
We have a "JMRI users" Yahoo group for general discussion.  If you want to ask a question, get some
help, or suggest some improvement, that discussion group is a good place.  You can
subscribe, browse posts, etc, at 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/</A>.<P>

Our <A HREF="Technical/index.html">technical web pages</A> are still being written.
This is still an early stage, and we're critically short of documentation.  
But if you're interested
in working with the code, we'd love to help you get started via email, etc.

<h3>Hardware requirements</h3>

JMRI connects to a LocoNet via a Digitrax MS100 adapter or a LocoBuffer.
Lenz and Atlas systems require a LI100 interface; note that you can't 
program decoders with an Atlas system and an LI100 due to limitations of the Atlas Commander.
EasyDCC, Wangrow and NCE command stations connect directly to a serial port. For more information,
please see the 
<A HREF="README.html">README file</a>.
<P>
The demo is developed on a USB Macintosh, which is interfaced to a layout and LocoNet via
a Keyspan PDA Adapter, DB9 to DB25 cable, and a Digitrax MS100 and/or LocoBuffer.  The
Keyspan PDA adapter also works for connecting to the NCE command station. Note that 
MacOS X systems cannot communicate with an MS100.

<h3>Digitrax-specific information</h3>
As a convenience for people using JRMI with Digitrax systems, we've got a directory of 
<A HREF="DigiTrax/">Digitrax-specific information</A>:
