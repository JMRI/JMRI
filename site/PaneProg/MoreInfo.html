<H2>More info on the DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer</h2>

This page provides a little information on how the DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer works.
(Introductory information is available on the 
<A HREF="index.html">prior page</A>)
For details on JMRI internals, please see the
<A HREF="../Technical/index.html" NAME="technical pages">technical pages</A>, which are unfortunately still
being written.
<P>
<h3>Configuration files</h3>
There are two types of configuration files:

<UL>
<LI>Decoder configuration files - These carry the description of a specific type 
of decoder, and control how the programmer displays the variable information.
<LI>Locomotive configuration files - These carry the specific information on a 
single locomotive.
</UL>
<P>
The programmer can read either type of file. If you select a decoder file after 
clicking Read File, the programmer will be set up with the variables, options, etc 
for that type.  The values will be blank, as the programmer doesn't know anything
about what's been programmed into a specific decoder unit.
<P>
If you select a locomotive file after clicking Read File, information on both
the decoder configuration and the specific settings in this locomotive will be
displayed.  This shows you how the locomotive is already configured, allowing you
to make small changes with less chance of confusion.
<P>
You can also write locomotive files with the Write File button.  This will store
the known contents of the decoder, allowing you to come back to it later.
<P>
The configuration files are stored in XML format.  This is a standard form
for structured data. XML is being widely used to standardize the exchange of
data between different manufacturers in many fields; perhaps someday DCC decoder
manufacturers will provide an XML description of each decoder they make.
In the meantime, the configuration files are being created by volunteers.  
If one
doesn't exist for a specific decoder you've got, you can 
<A HREF="ConfigFile.html">create your own</A>.
You can also modify a file if you'd prefer different names, a different grouping
of options, or you just never want to see that certain options that you don't use.
A simple text editor can create these files easily,
as the format doesn't have fixed length fields, special characters, etc.
There are also powerful public-domain XML tools that make it really easy
to manage a large number of decoder files.
<P>
More information on how to create a new configuration file is
available on a <A HREF="ConfigFile.html">separate page</A>.

<h3>Variables</h3>
A "variable" defines the value that will be loaded into 
all or part of a CV.  For example, a variable can be 
defined that sets the value of the three most-significant 
bits of CV 47.  If there are several options configured
in a single CV, these would normally be handled by separate variables.
Currently, there are several types of variables:
<UL>
<LI>Decimal - numbers entered in the usual decimal notation.  These 
are useful for short address, starting voltages, etc.
<LI>Enum (enumerated) - choose from a set of options.  These can be used
for simple on/off, yes/no choices, or more complicated sets like the
FX lighting example above.  The configuration contains a name for each 
possibility.
<LI>Long address - like a decimal value, except the constraints on a valid
long address are taken into account.
<LI>Hex - This is not so much needed, since the multiple options in a 
single CV can be handled by multiple variables.  But if its needed for some
reason, the capability is present.
<LI>Speed table - not yet really working well, this type of variable is
intended to provide a graphic speed table chart that you can drag around to
configure as you wish.
</UL>

<h3>Programmer communication; states</h3>
Communication with the command station / programmer, hence reading and writing
of the decoder, are only done when the "Read" or "Write" buttons are pressed.
The program keeps track of whether a value has been sent to the decoder using 
four states for variables or CVs:
<UL>
<LI>Read - The value shown was read from the decoder.
<LI>Stored - The value shown has been written to the decoder.
<LI>Editted - The value shown has been changed in the computer, but not yet written 
		to the decoder.  Push the Write button when you're happy with the value.
<LI>Unknown - A default value, or a read has failed, or for some other reason
        the program has no confidence that the value is what you really want.
        Edit the value or press the Write button.
</UL>
