<H2>Configuration files for the DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer</h2>

This page provides a little information on how the configuration files
for the DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer work.
(Introductory information for the programmer is available on the 
<A HREF="index.html">prior page</A>)
For details on JMRI internals, please see the
<A HREF="../Technical/index.html" NAME="technical pages">technical pages</A>, which are unfortunately still
being written.

In the first section, we walk you through the process of creating a file to
describe a new file.
This section is first because we think that its the first thing that 
most people will want to do.  But you might benefit from reading 
the later sections to get background information, especially
the XML introduction and the section on what the configuration files contain.


<a id="createDecoder"><h3>Creating a custom decoder configuration file</h3></a>

The easiest way to create a configuration file is to 
modify an existing one.  In this section, we walk you 
through doing this.
<OL>
<LI>
Make a copy of a similar file.  Although you can
call this new file anything you like, it will work best
if you use the same convention as the provided files.  That's
<code>"manufacturer name"_"decoder family".xml</code>, for example:
<PRE>
    Digitrax_1x2.xml
    Atlas_DualMode.xml
</pre>
For the provided files, we use the same capitalization, etc, that the
decoder manufacturer uses in their documentation. 
<P>
This new file should go in the "xml" subdirectory in the "prefs"
directory where you've installed
the JMRI package.  The program will find it there.

<LI>
Open the new file with your favorite editor.  You'll see something like this
at the top (the examples are from the <A HREF="../xml/Digitrax_1x2.xml">Digitrax_1x2.xml</A> file):
	<PRE>
	&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
	&lt;!DOCTYPE decoder-config SYSTEM "decoder-config.dtd"&gt;
	&lt;!-- $Id: ConfigFile.html,v 1.3 2001-12-27 16:31:18 jacobsen Exp $ --&gt;
	&lt;decoder-config&gt;
	</PRE>
Don't mess with these lines; they describe the format of the file.

<LI>
The next element describes the decoder file:
<PRE>
		&lt;version author="jake@physics.berkeley.edu" 
			version="1" lastUpdated="20011201"/&gt;
</PRE>
These attributes are only read by people, not the program, so their
exact format isn't critical.  But we encourage you to insert your email
address in files you create or change, so that if anybody has any questions
they can find you.  The version and lastUpdated attributes provide a 
way of telling different versions of a decoder definition apart, so we'd
also like you to update those.  For a new file, set the version back to "1",
and if you're modifying an existing file, increment the version attribute
to the next number.			

<LI>
The next lines describe the decoder:
	<PRE>
	&lt;decoder&gt;
		&lt;id family="Digitrax 1x2" mfg="Digitrax" mfgID="129" defnVersion="0"
				lowVersionID="240" highVersionID="242"
				comment="Digitrax DH142, etc" /&gt;
	</PRE>
The spacing is not important, but its useful to ident the file like this to make it more readable.
XML uses "elements" and "attributes" to carry information.  The &lt;abc&gt; things are elements; attributes
are set to specific values within elements.  In the 2nd through 4th lines above
	<PRE>
		&lt;id family="Digitrax 1x2" mfg="Digitrax" mfgID="129" defnVersion="0"
				lowVersionID="240" highVersionID="242"
				comment="Digitrax DH142, etc" /&gt;
	</PRE>
the element is 'id', with attributes 'family', 'mfg', 'mfgID', 'defnVersion', and 'comment'.
An attribute is given a value with an equals sign and a value in quotes (the quotes are required).
The order of the attributes is not important, and you can break them across lines if that
makes the file easier to read. Note that all of the attributes must be inside the angle
brackets, and after the name of the element.
<P>
In this element, change the attributes to match your new decoder:
	<UL>
	<LI>model - the model name of the decoder.  Its best if you use the same
	model name here as you used in the filename.
	<LI>mfg - the manufacturer of the decoder.  Its best if you use the same
	manufacturer name here as you used in the filename.
	<LI>mfgID - the numeric manufacturer id that the manufacturer loads into CV 8 of their decoders.
		Each manufacturer has a different code, so the programmer can check if
		this file is being used with the expected decoder type.
		The NMRA has standardized these. You can read the 
		value from a decoder, or perhaps look it up in the
		decoderIndex.xml file distributed with the program.
		If you don't know it, just leave it as
		an empty (zero-length) string "".
	<LI> lowVersionID, highVersionID - 
		The manufacturer can load a version number into CV 7 of a
		decoder.  
		Not all manufacturers do this, but if one is available
		the programmer can check if
		this file is being used with the expected decoder type.	
		If only one value is valid, define the attribute
		lowVersionID, e.g. 
		<PRE>
	lowVersionID="123"
		</PRE>
		If the decoder type can have any one of a range of numbers,
		for example because the manufacturer has made some updates,
		define both attributes.
		If you don't know the version number, don't define
		either of these attributes.
	<LI>defnVersion - a version number for this decoder definition.  This might be
		a software version number from a manufacturer or similar.  It doesn't 
		correspond to any standard CV value.
	<LI>comment - this is optional. You might want to include your name, or other
		info about the changes in the file.
	</UL>

<LI>
The next element defines what programming modes the decoder can understand:
	<PRE>
	&lt;programming direct="byteOnly" paged="yes" 
	                     register="yes" ops="yes"&gt;&lt;/programming&gt;
	</PRE>
Paged, register and ops can be set to either "yes" or "no".  Direct can
be set to "no", "bitOnly", "byteOnly", or "yes".
The programmer uses this 
information to select the programming mode to use when working with a decoder.

<LI>
The enxt part of the file consists of a set of 'variable' elements
defining specific variables, nested inside
a 'variables' (note the extra "s") element. An example:
	<PRE>
	&lt;variable name="Short Address" CV="1" stdName="Primary Address" default="03"&gt;
		&lt;decVal min="1" max="127"/&gt;
		&lt;/variable&gt;
	</PRE>
Each variable represents one thing to configure.  They can represent 
a single CV, e.g. address, or a few bits that can be
configured to control a particular function.
If some of these aren't appropriate to your decoder, you can just remove them.
Make sure you remove the entire element from the &lt;variable&gt;
to the matching &lt;/variable&gt;.
You can also rearrange them if you'd prefer a different order.
<P>
The attributes include:
	<UL>
	<LI>name - The name for this variable.
	<LI>stdName - An alternative, 'standard' name. See below for
		more information on this.
	<LI>CV - Which CV contains the configuration information
		for this variable.
	<LI>mask - A pattern like "XXXVVVXX" which controls which
		bits in the CV make up the variable. Each "V" is a bit
		that's included, and "X" are bits that are not to be 
		included.  Its best to have eight characters, as that
		makes it clearer what's going on.  If the variable
		is a full byte, this attribute can be omitted.
	<LI>default - The default value for this variable. This is
		used for a new decoder, or when you want to set the
		decoder back to its defaults.
	<LI>comment - Use this for whatever you want.
	</UL>
(There are a few more, which we'll leave for the advanced section below)

<LI>
You can also define new variables. A good starting point is to copy a
similar definition, change its name to a new value, and then edit its
contents.
<P>
To define how the new variable is displayed and editted, you add elements within
the 'variable' element.  There are several possible forms:
<UL>
<LI>For a decimal value, you include a decVal element like the 
example above.  The two optional attributes are min and max, 
which define the range of acceptable values. If you
omit them, values from 0 to 255 are allowed.
<LI>If you'd rather enter and display values in hexadecimal, use a
'hexVal' element. Its otherwise the same as the
'decVal' element we've alread discussed.
<LI>If your decoder supports a long address, you can add a 
'longAddress' element. Its perhaps easiest to copy
this from another file, or from this example:
<PRE>
	&lt;variable name=&quot;Long Address&quot; CV=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
		&lt;longAddressVal/&gt;
		&lt;/variable&gt;
<\PRE>		
<LI>if your decoder, supports it, you can enter
a 'speedTableVal' element for the speed table.  The only
attribute is entries, which can be either "28", "14" or some
other value.  Example:
<PRE>
	&lt;variable name=&quot;Speed Table&quot; CV=&quot;67&quot;&gt;
		&lt;speedTableVal/&gt;
		&lt;/variable&gt;
<\PRE>
<LI>Some decoder options are best represented by "choose one choice". These are 
represented by a enumVariable element. Example:
<PRE>
	&lt;variable name=&quot;F6 during DC operation&quot; CV=&quot;13&quot; mask=&quot;XXVXXXXX&quot;&gt;
		&lt;enumVal&gt;
			&lt;enumChoice choice=&quot;Off&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;enumChoice choice=&quot;On&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;/enumVal&gt;
		&lt;/variable&gt;
</PRE>
Each enumChoice element describes one possibility.  There can be 
as many of these as desired.  For a one bit choice, you use two 
enumChoice elements as in the
example.  For a 4 bit choice, like the FX codes in a Digitrax decoder, you
can use up to 16 choices.  They are displayed in the order they are entered
in the file, and are also numbered in that order.  If the first is chosen,
a 0 is entered in the CV bits; choosing the second stores 1; etc.
</UL>
At this point, you've created a new configuration file.
<LI>
All that's left is to enter your new file in the index.  This index
is used to speed the startup of the program, when a list of 
possible decoder's is constructed.
<P>
Open the "decoderIndex.xml" file in the "xml" directory.
You'll see a number of clauses like:
<PRE>
	&lt;family name="Digitrax 1x2" file="Digitrax_1x2.xml" mfg="Digitrax" 
				lowVersionID="240" highVersionID="242"&gt;
		&lt;decoder model="DH142" numOuts="4" /&gt;
		&lt;decoder model="DN142" numOuts="4" /&gt;
		&lt;decoder model="DH083" numOuts="5" /&gt;
	&lt;/family&gt;
</PRE>
Each of these 'family' elements enters a decoder file into the index.
Since a file might represent several different specific
decoder models in a family, the 'decoder' elements define the
specific decoder models.  We leave the "numOuts" attribute for
later discussion in the advanced section. The rest of the 
attributes are pretty self-describing.
<P>
Add one more of these clauses for your new file.
</ol>

<P>
Congratulations!  You're done.  Next, open the 
programmer application and try it.

<a id="introXML"><h3>A very short introduction to XML files</h3></a>

All of the configuration files use the XML format. 
This section is a  
brief explanation of that format to make it a little easier to read.

<P>XML files are made up of "elements", which are delimited by "tags". 
It's a lot like HTML, if you're familiar with that.  A tag is enclosed
in angle brackets, for example <decoder>.  An element can either begin
and end with a tag:
<PRE>
	&lt;decoder&gt;
		other stuff here
	&lt;/decoder&gt;
</pre>
or have both the start and end tags combined:
<PRE>
	&lt;decoder/&gt;
</PRE>
Note the back-slash characters. They mark the end of the element.  The starting
tag of an element can also carry attributes:
<PRE>
	&lt;decoder name="foo"&gt;
		other stuff here
	&lt;/decoder&gt;
</PRE>
The example shows the attribute "name" being set to a value of "foo".
Some attributes are required, and some are optional.  Note the double-quotes
around the attribute value. They are required.
<P>
Finally, a word about line-breaks and indentation. 
Tabs, spaces and line-breaks don't mean anything in XML files
except within the double quotes of an attribute value.  
To make it easier
to read the original file, we often use the indenting to show what elements
are inside each other.  Each time we start a new element, we indent its
contents by another four spaces.  An example would be:
<PRE>
	&lt;decoder&gt;
		&lt;variable&gt;
		 	stuff in the 1st variable element
		&lt;/variable&gt;
		&lt;variable&gt;
			stuff in the 2nd variable element
		&lt;/variable&gt;
	&lt;/decoder&gt;
</PRE>
You can break the contents of an element across a line, if that
makes it easier to read:
<PRE>
	&lt;tagWithLotsOfAttributes  firstAttribute="foo" secondAttribute="bar"
			thirdAttribute="biff" fourthAttribute="bing" /&gt;
</PRE>
