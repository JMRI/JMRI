<h2>Speedometer</h2>

The 
<A HREF="index.html">JMRI libraries</a>
contain a speedometer tool that you can use directly from the GUI,
or build into your own applications
<P>
It does work in the 1.1.4 version, although there were some problems in 
the earlier versions.  It only works with Digitrax there, as the code for 
reading feedback from other systems isn't available yet.
We working on adding support for NCE AIU units, and for directly
<A HREF="Serialsensor.html">connecting sensors to the serial port</a>.
<P>
Before it will report the speed, you need to configure it.
<P>
To do this, enter sensor numbers in the three fields.  This is a 
number (like 23) for the address of the BDL16, DS54, etc channel that 
will report when the occupancy changes.  The simplest way to get the 
right number is to open a "LocoNet monitor" window, and drop a 
locomotive onto the block you're interested in.  You'll see the 
LocoNet message, complete with number, in the window that looks 
something like this:
<PRE>
   General sensor input report: contact 161 (DS54 20 ch1 Sw  input)
        (BDL16 10 A2) is Lo
</PRE>
The contact number, 161 in this case, is what you want.
<P>
There are three sensors so you can have a shorter interval for slow 
speeds and a longer interval for fast speeds.  (Roger Gleason added 
this)  The timing is from sensor 1 to sensor 2, and from sensor 1 to 
sensor 3.
<P>
You also need to select "on entrance" or "on exit" for each of the 
sensors.  This says whether the clock will start/stop when the sensor 
shows the block is first occupied, or when it shows the block is 
first unoccupied.
<P>
You also enter the distance in _scale_ feet between the various 
points.  If you're using "on entrance", measure using the entrance 
end of the block.
<P>
Finally, click the "Start" button.  The three little red dots along 
the right side will start changing color to indicate the status of 
the selected sensors: Red for "unknown", no message seen yet; White 
for "unoccupied"; Green or yellow for "occupied".
<P>
Once you click the Start button, you can't change the configuration. 
Just close that window and open another one.  You can have multiple 
speedometer tool windows open if you'd like.
