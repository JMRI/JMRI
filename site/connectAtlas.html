<h2>Limitations of the XPressNet connection to an Atlas DCC system</h2>

Unfortunately, the Atlas Commander will not accept programming commands
via its XPressNet connection.  This means that DecoderPro can't program
decoders via a LI100 and Atlas Commander.
<P>
There doesn't appear to be anything we can do about this.
<P>
You can still operate your layout via the JMRI libraries with an Atlas
Commander and LI100, but it's not a very cost-effective approach.

<h2>Connecting to an Atlas DCC system</h2>

To connect your computer to an Atlas Commander DCC system, you need a
Lenz LI100 interface unit.  Connect those two units together via their
XpressNet connections.  Then connect the LI100 to the computer's serial
port using a 9-pin serial cable.
<P>
Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.  This opens 
automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select it from
the "Edit" menu.  
<P>
Select "Lenz XPressNet" from the top selection box. You can then
select the proper serial port in the second selection box.  
<P>
The baud rate selection box should be set to match your LI100 or LI101.
From the factory, the LI100 is set to 9600 baud, The LI101 is set to
19,200 baud.
<P>
The fourth box should be left on
"hardware flow control" unless you later consistently get a message
about the LI100 control leads being improperly set up, in which case
you might want to try to bypass that by selecting "no flow control".
<P>
The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to select
how the program will look.  
"Metal" is the native Java look available on all types. 
Other choices will vary with your computer type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" 
and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X
respectively.
<P>
In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer format. You can
override this each time you open the programmer, so this is here just for convenience.
<P>
Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to quit, click "Yes".
<P>
Restart the program. You should be up and running.
