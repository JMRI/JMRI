<H2>Automat:  JMRI layout automation support</H2>

This page still under construction:
<IMG SRC="images/bangdesk.gif">

<P>
The "Automat" class provides an easy way to write automation for your layout
using JMRI.

<P>
Key aspect: These run in a separate thread, so they can wait for something
to happen while the rest of the program proceeds. Effectively, each Automat
is a separate program running when it needs to.

<h3>Throttles</h3>
there's a line like:
<PRE>
    // get the throttle instance for short address 3
   throttle = getThrottle(3, false);
</PRE>
that assigns "short address 3" to the "throttle" variable 
(the "false" selects short address; long address would have been "true").  
If this doesn't work for some reason, you'll get a periodic 
"still waiting for throttle" message in the Java window, and the program will wait.
 
<H3>To put up some message boxes</h3>

You can do that directly from Java, but it takes a little code to do it.  
To simplify it at the start, I've added a "MsgFrame" helper class to the 
library. 
<P>
To make a message box, you first make an object of the "MsgFrame" class:
<PRE>
  MsgFrame box = new MsgFrame();
</PRE>
(You can call it whatever you'd like, of course).  That line should go with the 
other declarations, e.g. right after the "DccThrottle throttle = null;" line.
<P>
Then, inside the test routines, there are a few things you can do.  
To show a message and wait for the user to click a "Continue" button, do:
<PRE>
   box.show("my message text goes here", true);
</PRE>
The 2nd argument shows the "Continue button and waits if true, and just continues if false.  So if you'd like to show a status message while the program continues to run, do:
<PRE>
  box.show("status message text", false);
</PRE>
If you've done that, you can change the message with another "show", or you can make the box go away with:
<PRE>
  box.hide();
</PRE>
Java actually has to do some work to pop the box and draw it.  We don't want 
that to delay the main test program, so I've written this helper class to do 
all that kind of work as a 2nd, lower priority.  
You should be able to put messages up on the screen without significantly 
slowing operation down (unless the program waits for the "Continue" button to be 
pressed, of course).  And waiting for "Continue" to be pressed won't stop the
operation of the rest of the program.
