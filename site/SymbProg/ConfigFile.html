<H2>Configuration files for the Symbolic Programmer</h2>

This page provides a little information on the configuration files
for the JMRI Symbolic Programmer works.
(Introductory information is available on the 
<A HREF="index.html">prior page</A>)
For details on JMRI internals, please see the
<A HREF="../Technical/index.html" NAME="technical pages">technical pages</A>, which are unfortunately still
being written.
<P>
<h3>Creating a custom configuration file</h3>

The easiest way to create a configuration file is to 
modify an existing one.  In this section, we walk you 
through doing this.
<OL>
<LI>
Make a copy of a similar file.  Although you can
call this new file anything you like, it will work best
if you use the same convention as the provided files.  That's
<code>"manufacturer name"_"decoder model".xml</code>, for example:
<PRE>
    Digitrax_DH142.xml
    Atlas_DualMode.xml
    Lenz_LE320.xml
</pre>
For the provided files, we use the same capitalization, etc, that the
decoder manufacturer uses in their documentation. 
<P>
This new file should go in the "xml" subdirectory of where you've installed
the JMRI package.  This will make it easy to find from the program.

<LI>
Open the new file with your favorite editor.  You'll see something like this
at the top (the examples are from the <A HREF="Digitrax_DH142.xml.html">Digitrax_DH142.xml</A> file):
	<PRE>
	&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
	&lt;!DOCTYPE decoder:decoder-config SYSTEM &quot;DTD/decoder-config.dtd&quot;&gt;
	&lt;decoder:decoder-config xmlns:decoder=&quot;http://jmri.sourceforge.net/xml/decoder&quot;&gt;
	</PRE>
Don't mess with these lines; they describe the format of the file.

<LI>
The next lines describe the decoder:
	<PRE>
	&lt;decoder:decoder&gt;
	&lt;decoder:id model=&quot;All&quot; mfg=&quot;Digitrax&quot; mfgID=&quot;129&quot; defnVersion=&quot;0&quot;
				comment=&quot;DH142 decoder: FX, transponding&quot;&gt;&lt;/decoder:id&gt;
	</PRE>
The spacing is not important, but its useful to ident the file like this to make it more readable.
XML uses "elements" and "attributes" to carry information.  The &lt;abc&gt; things are elements; attributes
are set to specific values within elements.  In the 2nd line above
	<PRE>
	&lt;decoder:id model=&quot;All&quot; mfg=&quot;Digitrax&quot; mfgID=&quot;129&quot; defnVersion=&quot;0&quot;
				comment=&quot;DH142 decoder: FX, transponding&quot;&gt;&lt;/decoder:id&gt;
	</PRE>
the element is 'decoder:id', with attributes 'model', 'mfg', 'mfgID', 'defnVersion', and 'comment'.
An attribute is given a value with an equals sign and a value in quotes (the quotes are required).
The order of the attributes is not important, and you can break them across lines if that
makes the file easier to read. Note that all of the attributes must be inside the angle
brackets, and after the name of the element.
<P>
In this element, change the attributes to match your new decoder:
	<UL>
	<LI>model - the model name of the decoder.  Its best if you use the same
	model name here as you used in the filename.
	<LI>mfg - the manufacturer of the decoder.  Its best if you use the same
	manufacturer name here as you used in the filename.
	<LI>mfgID - the numeric manufacturer id that the manufacturer loads into CV 8 of their decoders.
		Each manufacturer has a different code, so the programmer can check if
		this file is being used with the expected decoder type.
		The NMRA has standardized these. If you don't know it, just leave it as
		an empty (zero-length) string "".
	<LI>defnVersion - the decoder version number that the manufacturer loads into CV 7 of this
		type of decoder.  Not all manufacturers do this, but if one is available
		the programmer can check if
		this file is being used with the expected decoder type.	
		If you don't know it, just leave it as
		an empty (zero-length) string "".
	<LI>comment - this is optional. You might want to include your name, or other
		info about the changes in the file.
	</UL>

<LI>
The next element defines what modes the decoder can understand:
	<PRE>
	&lt;decoder:programming direct=&quot;byteOnly&quot; paged=&quot;yes&quot; 
	                     register=&quot;yes&quot; ops=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/decoder:programming&gt;
	</PRE>
Paged, register and ops can be set to either "yes" or "no".  Direct can
be set to "no", "bitOnly", "byteOnly", or "yes".  Currently, the symbolic 
programmer doesn't use this information, as it allows you to select
any programming mode without restriction. 

<LI>
The rest of the file consists of a set of decoder:variable elements
defining specific variables, nested inside
a decoder:variables (note the extra "s") element. An example:
	<PRE>
		&lt;decoder:variable name=&quot;Address&quot; CV=&quot;1&quot; mask=&quot;VVVVVVVV&quot; comment=&quot;Short address&quot;&gt;
			&lt;decoder:decVal min=&quot;1&quot; max=&quot;127&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;/decoder:variable&gt;
	</PRE>
If some of these aren't appropriate to your decoder, you can just remove them.
Make sure you remove the entire element from the &lt;decoder:variable
to the matching &lt;/decoder:variable&gt;.
<P>
You can also rearrange them if you'd prefer a different order.  They are displayed
by the programmer in the same order they appear in the file.

<LI>
You can also define new variables. A good starting point is to copy a
similar definition, change its name to a new value, and then edit its
contents.
<P>	
The CV attribute defines the CV this variable will program. The mask attribute
can restrict it to only some of the bits in the CV, as a "X" means the bit will be
left alone, while a "V" makes a bit that will be programmed.
<P>
To define how the new variable is displayed and editted, you add elements within
the decoder:variable element.  There are several possible forms:
	<UL>
	<LI>For a decimal value, you include a decoder:decVal element like the 
		example above.  The two optional attributes are min and max, 
		which define the range of acceptable values.
	<LI>If you'd rather enter and display values in hexadecimal, use a
		decoder:hexVal element. Its otherwise the same as the
		decoder:decVal element we've alread discussed.
	<LI>If your decoder supports a long address, you can add a 
		decoder:longAddress element. Its perhaps easiest to copy
		this from another file, or from this example:
		<PRE>
		&lt;decoder:variable name=&quot;Long Address&quot; CV=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
			&lt;decoder:longAddressVal/&gt;
			&lt;/decoder:variable&gt;
		<\PRE>		
	<LI>Although it doesn't work in the programmer yet, you can enter
		a decoder:speedTableVal element for the speed table.  The only
		attribute is entries, which can be either "28", "14" or some
		other value.  Example:
		<PRE>
		&lt;decoder:variable name=&quot;Speed Table&quot; CV=&quot;67&quot;&gt;
			&lt;decoder:speedTableVal/&gt;
			&lt;/decoder:variable&gt;
		<\PRE>
	<LI>Some decoder options are best represented by "choose one choice".
	These are represented by a decoder:enumVariable element. Example:
		<PRE>
		&lt;decoder:variable name=&quot;F6 during DC operation&quot; CV=&quot;13&quot; mask=&quot;XXVXXXXX&quot;&gt;
			&lt;decoder:enumVal&gt;
				&lt;decoder:enumChoice choice=&quot;Off&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;decoder:enumChoice choice=&quot;On&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;/decoder:enumVal&gt;
			&lt;/decoder:variable&gt;
		</PRE>
	Each decoder:enumChoice element describes one possibility.  There can be 
	as many of these as desired.  For a one bit choice, you use two as in the
	example.  For a 4 bit choice, like the FX codes in a Digitrax decoder, you
	can use up to 16 choices.  They are displayed in the order they are entered
	in the file, and are also numbered in that order.  If the first is chosen,
	a 0 is entered in the CV bits; chosing the second stores 1; etc.
	
	</UL>

<P>
Congratulations!  You've created a new configuration file.  Next, open the 
symbolic programmer inside the
JMRI application and try it.
