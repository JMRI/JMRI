   <title>Installing on Windows</title>

<body>

<P>
<h3><a id="Windows">Windows installation instructions:</a></h3>

We recommend you have at least 48MB of 
memory for Windows 95 or 98, and 64MB of memory for Windows 2000 or later.
We have had a report that a 100MHz Pentium is too slow to use, and another
that a 120MHz Pentium II is fine, so somewhere around there is the minimum
machine configuration.
For the more complicated 
programmer screens, a display with a resolution of 800x600 or larger is
strongly recommended.
<P>
You need to have Java 1.3.1 or later installed on your machine. 
We test with JRE 1.3.1-01 and recommend you 
use it or a later version. 
If you don't yet have Java installed,
you can also get installers from Sun at
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/">http://java.sun.com/getjava/</a>.
You must run the Java installer (or have previously done so) 
before running the JMRI installer in the next step, or it will 
issue an error message and stop.
<P>
Download the JMRI 1.1 installer from 
<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.1.1.exe">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.1.1.exe</a>.
Run that installer.  
It will ask you to read some licensing information, and
then install the needed libraries, plus add a "JMRI" program group to 
your Start menu and put a shortcut to the DecoderPro program on your
desktop.
<P>
Installation is complete.
You can start the programs from the JMRI group under Programs in your
Start menu.

<P>
If you're using a "skinning" utility which changes the appearance of
programs running on your computer, you should tell it to ignore 
the "java.exe" program.  That's how JMRI and DecoderPro will appear to
it, and they weren't written with such "skins" in mind.

<h3>Serial port configuration</h3>
DecoderPro may encounter problems if the serial port used to
connect to the layout shares an interrupt with another serial
port.  In particular, some systems are unable to communicate
when the layout's serial port shares an interrupt with a port
used for a serial mouse.  Please make sure that the serial port
connected to your layout does not share an interrupt with
another serial port.

<h3>Connecting your layout to the computer</h3>
To connect your layout to the computer, follow one of these links:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="connectAtlas.html">Atlas Commander via Lenz LI100</a>: 
Note that you can't program decoders with this configuration.
