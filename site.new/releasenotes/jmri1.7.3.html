      Release Notes for JMRI 1.7.3 test release
      </H2>

	<p>Date: MM NN, 2005</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.7.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<P>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier version.

<P>This is the next in a series of test versions that contain long-awaited new features, particularly improved support for QSI decoders, wait cursors in the programmer, and significant internal updates.  Some of the changes involved are quite extensive, and may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<P>This test version contains important fixes for users programming QSI decoders and Digitrax boards in the PM, BDL and SE series.

<h3>New warnings for this test version:</h3>

<P>We have added additional information to the roster files in this version to help properly handle short/long addressing in systems that allow low addresses (e.g. 65) to be either short or long addresses. The only current system we support that has this capability is NCE.  If you have an NCE system, and you have locomotives with addresses of 127 or less, you should open their roster entries in DecoderPro, check that the proper short or long address is selected,  and save them again.

<h3>Older warnings from this series of test versions:</h3>

<P>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<P>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<P>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<P>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.

<h3>Changes since test version 1.7.3:</h3>

<P>David Duchamp fixed a bug that caused problems when the serial port that the program was expecting wasn't available at startup.

<P>Bob Jacobsen has updated the PRICOM Pocket Tester support. There are now both "monitor" windows to see the time history of the data as it comes from the unit, plus a "table" that allows you to see the most recent packets of a particular type or for a particular address.  You can also see the monitor for just the packets to a particular address. It's also been internationalized, so it would be easy for somebody to translate it to another language. 

<P>Paul Bender has fixed a problem that would sometimes make the speed slider not appear in the throttle tool.  He has also improved the way that a control-click (right click, etc) in the speed section of the throttle gets you access to the alternate method of setting speeds.

<P>Bob Jacobsen updated the startup error handling so that the preferences window is again showing if the pre-configured connection fails.  (Also in 1.6.1)

<P>At the suggestion of John Harper, AbstractAutomaton is now using notifyAll() instead of notify().  For more information, see recent discussion in jmri-developers mailing list.

<P>On Linux, the startup scripts are now called "DecoderPro", "PanelPro", etc, with no file extension.  (The old ones were left in place)  Also, they now us the Bourne shell, which is more generally available than C shell. (david zuhn)

<P>Soundtraxx DSD definitions now properly show function mapping for functions 7 and 8 (Don Mitchell, Robin Becker)

<P>John Harper updated the Throttle tool so that (optionally) the locomotive speed will continually change as you move the slider. Previously, it only updated when you released the slider.

<P>Alfredo Sola updated the Spanish translation

<P>Paul Bender updated the consisting tools to allow specification of basic (short) or extended (long) format addressing for systems where those overlap, e.g. NCE

<P>John Harper fixed bug 1257961: Serial replies containing negative byte values display them with an extra leading FF

<P>John Harper and Bob Jacobsen updated the serial infrastructure to improve response time for NCE, C/MRI, and perhaps others on (some) Windows systems

<P>John Harper added support for asynchronous AIU messages from NCE command stations, to improve sensor response time

<P>Mark Schutzer updated the Lenz Gold definition to include the "mini" version.

<P>John Harper made the waitMsec() function more reliable

<P>David Duchamp added code to deal with null pointers resulting from various startup errors.

<P>Michael Mosher provided new TCS decoder definitions

<P>John Harper fixed a bug that would crash the symbolic programmer while changing values (you'd get an "index out of range" error)

<P>JavaDoc fixes, as usual

<P>John Harper added a new feature:  Automatic retry on turnout operations.  If activated (see the Turnout Table), it will retry a turnout either until the feedback shows it's moved to the proper place, or (for turnouts without feedback) some fixed number of times.  There's also a new menu item in the TUrnout Table for configuring this.
