	<p>Date: MMM NN, 2009</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.7.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fifth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.8 production release in December 2009. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None)

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

JMRI 2.7.4 changes the way filenames for icons, etc, are stored in XML files by JMRI.
The advantage is that this new method will make it much easier to move 
panel files from one computer to another, even of a different type.  So long as you
keep all your files in the JMRI preferences directory on both machines, the files
should just move over without trouble.  The warning is that files written in this 
format will not be properly read by JMRI versions before 2.7.4.
This includes files
from earlier versions that are read by JMRI 2.7.4 or later and then written out again, 
as the program will update them to the new format upon storing them.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.7.4</h3>

<p>
Pete Cressman fixed a problem storing and loading the new Memory Spinner Icon, 
improved some labeling in the icon selector, 
and added more controls to the memory icon popup menu.

<p>
When storing references to files, e.g. custom icons in panel files
if the file is stored in your home directory, JMRI will store a relative "home:" 
reference, in addition to the already-present detection for files in the
JMRI program and preferences directory. This makes it easier to move panel files
from computer to computer; just make sure you have the icons, etc, in the same relative
place on the two machines.

<p>
Ken Cameron added sensor support for X10 Powerline devices.  Once you have manually created
a sensor using the Sensor Table, changed heard on the powerline will adjust the corresponding
sensor's state.

<p>
Pete Cressman made some improvement to Panel Editor icon handling.

<p>
Pete Cressman added support for Float values in Memories.

<p>
Paul Bender fixed a problem with XPressNet throttle setup that was particularly problematic for Hornby users.

<p>
Ken Cameron improved his RobotThrottle script.

<p>
Dan Boureau added status information to the operations route table.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson improved the way we check for duplicate roster IDs to catch some additional
cases.

<p>
Paul Bender corrected a bug in XPressNet LI100 programmer which made it difficult to read 
multiple values from a decoder (single reads were ok).

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added a capability to connect locomotive information in the ECoS command station to JMRI.

<p>
Ken Cameron added a horn button to the RobotThrottle.

<P>
Paul Bender added some additional error messages to the DCC programmer.
