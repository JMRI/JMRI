      Release Notes for JMRI 2.11.5 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2011</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.11.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fifth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.12 or 3.0 production release in 2011. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
</ul>
along with other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None yet)

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

Development Version 2.11.4 contains significant improvements to the Powerline Interfaces. 
Some of these improvements involved a complete restructuring of the underlying code. 
As a result, previously working Preferences may now show no connections for some of the Powerline Interfaces. 
If this occurs, go to Preferences and setup the Powerline Layout Connections again. 
Then save the Preferences and restart JMRI.

<p>
In Development Version 2.11.3 JMRI instituted a more robust and transparent system for handling missing panel icon files. 
If missing icon files are discovered during the panel loading process 
this system presents a dialog box that allows the user to either delete the offending reference 
or use the file browser to find the proper location. 
Older versions of JMRI didn't always fully remove the references to deleted panel icons. 
Panels which contain these stray references will present the dialog box during the first panel load. 
If the panel worked fine before, simply choose the delete option for each "missing" icon presented 
to remove the stray references. Once the panel has finished loading, save/store the panel file, quit JMRI and then reload. As a precaution, we recommend either making a backup copy of your panel file before diving in or saving the modified file under a different name

<p>
There have been extensive changes to the throttle code.
If you have written scripts that use throttles, particularly
multiple throttles, please check to make sure they still work.

<p>
The numerical values of "ON" and "OFF" for Lights changed in JMRI 2.11.2, 
along with some of the other constants in the class.  
This will have no impact on people just using the program.  
If you're using scripts with numerical values
in them, please recode them to use the symbolic values.

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since test release version  2.11.4</h3>

<P>Dan Boudreau:</P>

<P>New operations features and bug fixes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Enhancement to the "Set Cars" tool.  You can now ignore selected fields when changing a group of cars.</LI>
<LI>You can now optionally select which trains can set out and pick up cars from a siding.</LI>
<LI>Car routing enhancement, program now checks the number of available moves when determining if a
train can service a car.</LI>
<LI>Improved how the program set outs cars when there's two or more stops at the same location.  There is
now a bias to set out the cars at the earlier stop.</LI>
<LI>New schedules enhancement, uses can optionally control a schedule using the train timetables.  For example
you can now deliver a car to a siding based on the day of the week.</LI>
</UL>

<p>Pete Cressman</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Circuit Builder tool to Control Panel Editor.  This tool is an
 alternative to the Occupancy Tables that creates OBlocks,
 Portals and OPaths through a "point and click" GUI.</li>
<li>Fix route finder and warrant recording bug introduced in ver 2.11.4</li>
<li>Fix loco icon following warrant playback through all track citcuits.</li>
<li>Fix bug that did not load ver 2.4 signalHead icons.</lii>
<li>Fix bug that did not load rotated or scaled signalMastd icons.</li>
<li>Fix bug loading panel after Occupancy Block Table is open.</li>
<li>Inserting or deleting rows of a Throttle Command recording now
 keeps the total elapsed time a train is in a block the same.</li>
<li>Added set TrainID, set TrainName warrant actions to Logix</li>
<li>Fix background color of panels when changing views between editors</li>
<li>Add indirection to Logix actions for device names and action types.
 The '@' symbol before a memory location will use the value in that memory for
 the device name or its action string.</li>
<li>Simplifird LRoute GUI</li> 
<li>Added an LRoute "Initializer".  Creates a Logix guaranteed to execute first
 for initializing sensors, turnouts and signals, avoiding thrashing of
 enabling Logixes at panel load time.</li>
<li>Help files updated for Warrants, ItemPalette, Control Panel Editor</li>   
</ul>

<p>Lionel Jeanson</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new way to control locomotive speed in throttle control panel : the "continuous" speed slider going from -100 to +100 through 0 with automatic direction change at 0. (option accessible in throttle control panel property window)</li>
<li>Added an option to have a throttle control panel automatically switch between regular and continuous speed slider when a decoder function is activated/deactivated (most decoders have a slow function for "shunting" mode where a continuous speed slider is more appropriate for speed control). (option accessible in throttle control panel property window)</li>
<li>Added possibility to customize throttle function buttons with images in throttle function button property window</li>
<li>Added ability to save customized throttle function buttons in regular throttle files</li>
</ul>

<p>Paul Bender updated the error checking in the JMRI consisting tool.</p>

<p>Bob Jacobsen fixed a bug in LocoNet message processing that kept the "Send LocoNet Message" tool from 
sending multiple messages.
