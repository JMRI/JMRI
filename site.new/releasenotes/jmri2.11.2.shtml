dim to use extended command which is a single direct command. 
May not work with older dim modules. 
Also may cause cp290 interface issues, not tested yet on cp290.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson: Re-creates the serial port drop down list box each time it becomes active, thus picking up any new serial/usb interfaces that have been added since JMRI was started.

<p>
Signal Masts now have Lit and Held properties

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed several problems and added some new features to operations:
<ul>
<li>Fixed a build problem when a staging track didn't have an engine, and the staging track name was the same as another in a different location.
<li>Fixed two minor bugs, lead car in kernel wasn't always saved correctly, cars in a kernel didn't always have a proper destination and track.
<li>New feature, "Timetable" under Trains->Tools.  Allows you to quickly set which trains will run on any given day of the week.
<li>New tool "Routes->Tools->Set Train Icons Coordinates", you can now visually update train icon coordinates for all locations.
<li>New tool "Route->Tools->Set Train Icons Coordinates for this Route", you can now visually update train icon coordinates for a route.
<li>New route feature. User can now specify additional wait time in a route.  This allows you to adjust a train's manifest arrival times to your liking.
<li>New route feature. You can now set a departure time anywhere in a route.  Nice feature for passenger trains!
<li>New route feature. You can now add an optional comment to each stop in a route.  Comments will show up in your manifests.
