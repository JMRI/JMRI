      Release Notes for JMRI 1.3.8 developer release
      </H2>

	<p>Date: Feb 16, 2004</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.3.8 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for
      download.</p>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
	<ul>

	<li>This is a test release.</li>
	<li>Please post a note if you encounter any
	new or old bugs!</li>
	<li>Please back up your JMRI files before
	installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier
	version.</li>

	<li>Recent test versions are numbered 1.3.0, 1.3.4, 1.3.5 and 1.3.8.
	Some version numbers were skipped to avoid confusion with the Java
	version numbers; test versions 1.3.6 and 1.3.7 had problems and
	never reached public announcement status.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>New warnings:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>These downloads are significantly larger than version 1.3.5 and
	previous.  This is due to the addition of a help system starting in
	test version 1.3.8.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Older warnings for the 1.3 series of test versions:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>LocoNet sensor numbering has been changed starting in version
	1.3.4!  This will effect people who have panel files (.xml files
	containing panel definition) for LocoNet block occupancy sensors.
	The sensor numbers now start with 1, not 0, so you'll have to edit
	the panel files to change e.g. LS0 to LS1, LS23 to LS24, etc.  This
	does not effect input via other (non-LocoNet) protocols, including
	C/MRI, NCE AIU, etc.  If you use LocoNet sensor numbers for the
	Speedometer, you'll have to increase them by one also.</li>

	<li>There seems to be a problem with recent JMRI versions on
	Macintosh Classic. The cause of this is not understood. For some
	people it works fine, and for others it locks up totally. Because
	of this, no Classic download for this test version has been
	provided.</li>

	If you haven't downloaded and run a 1.2.something or 1.3.something
	version, this<li> version will require that you re-enter your
	preferences. You might want to open the preferences window (from
	the Edit menu) and write down your settings before installing this
	version. (You'll be able to go back to the older version if you
	need to)</li>

	<li>If you have pre-1.2.3 roster entries that use Zimo decoder
	definitions, you'll have to recreate them.  The Zimo decoder
	definitions have been completely reworked in a better organization
	starting with test version 1.2.3.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Changes since test version 1.3.5:</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>Jack Shall updated the appearance and added ToolTips in the
	DecoderPro comprehensive programmer.</li>

	<li>Dennis Miller added a "Help" system, which is accessed from the
	main menubar. Initial contents are Joe Ellis' DecoderPro manual
	(with some modifications), plus some additional pages.</li>

	<li>Paul Bender added an initial version of a consist-manager tool,
	based on a very general infrastructure. It should work for advanced
	(CV19) consists on any system currently supporting ops mode
	programming.</li>

	<li>DecoderPro will now use "Direct Bit" programming mode first if
	it's available in both the command station and decoder (previously,
	priority had been given to paged mode)</li>

	<li>Paul Bender added a Command Station Configuration manager. This
	code attempts to enable only the portions of the JMRI library that
	are useable with a given command station. For example, with the
	Lenz Compact/Atlas Commander, the Programmer is disabled since
	these units do not support programing from an XPressNet device. He
	also added code to the tools menu to disable items for which a
	manager does not exist.</li>

	<li>MERG decoders updated (Len Royles, Phil Grainger and
	others)</li>

	<li>Support added for the SPROG command station, including initial
	throttle support. This has had only limited testing, so feedback
	would be greatly appreciated!</li>

	<li>Alex Shepherd added support for the LocoNetOverTcp
	protocol.</li>

	<li>Plugin system added: See
	http://jmri.sf.net/Technical/plugins.html</li>

	<li>MacOS X now puts it's menus on the main menubar, making the
	applications much more Mac-like; Updates to icons, etc, on
	Macintosh systems.</li>

	<li>Alex Shepherd added a new "LocoBuffer statistics tool" which
	allows users of current LocoBuffer versions to view statistics on
	LocoNet traffic.</li>

	<li>A new "Decoder ID" page has been added to the web which is
	based on the current DecoderPro definitions automagically:
	http://jmri.sf.net/xml/XSLT/index.html</li>

	<li>Paul Bender added response message handling routines to Lenz
	Turnout Code. Forced send of an "off" after an "on" is sent to an
	accessory decoder. This corrects the "multiple fire issue" some
	people are seeing (And I have been able to replicate using a
	Switch-It, and a button to throw the turnout back to it's starting
	possition). Turnouts displayed through JMRI (either through a
	Control Panel, the Turnout tool, or the turnout table) will now
	react to commands sent via another expressnet device on systems
	that have feedback.</li>

	<li>Paul Bender started work on Lenz Sensor code. Skeleton in
	place. Feedback encoders should be reflected in the sensor table,
	though they are not currently handled. (this has not been
	tested).</li>

	<li>Paul Bender made modifications to the throttle GUI code so that
	it actually registers as a PropertyChangeListener with the system
	dependant throttle code. He also modified the throttle GUI and back
	end code, so the "Dispatch" button can be shut off on systems for
	which this makes no sense.</li>

	<li>Code for finding "DTD" files reworked in an attempt to fix
	startup problems on certain XP systems. Not really clear if it
	worked, feedback greatly appreciated.</li>

	<li>Paul Bender added ops mode programming support to Lenz.</li>

	<li>Fixed bug in LocoNet monitor where the Throttle ID field was
	being displayed wrong.</li>

	<li>Initial public release of Jython support for scripting and
	control (http://jmri.sf.net/Technical/Jython.html)</li>

	<li>Bug that prevented moving the Roster location (see advanced
	preferences) is probably fixed.</li>

	<li>Bug preventing display of SE8c example on some systems
	(http://jmri.sf.net/apps/Signalling/SimpleSignalExample.html) is believed
	fixed.</li>

	<li>Initial inclusion of "PacketPro" application for testing
	decoders (nee PacketScript)</li>
	</ul>
