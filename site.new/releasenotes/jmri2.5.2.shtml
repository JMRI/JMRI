	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.5.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the first in a new series of test versions.

It contains 
many new features, including:


<ul>
	<LI>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>


<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

<p>JMRI now requires Java 1.5 or later.
If you are using an older version of Java, please
<a href="http://www.sun.com/getjava">upgrade your Java installation</a>.  
To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>
The way you drag things in the Layout Editor has changed if you
are using a Linux computer. 

<p>
Windows desktop shortcuts have been restructured to make them more reliable.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be effected by this change.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.5.1:</h3>

Fixed some links within help pages.

<p>
Xavier Chazelle provided a new decoder definition for the Uhlenbrock 73400 mini decoder.

<p>
New NMRA manufacturer numbers:
<ul>
    <li>49 - Joka Electronic
    <li>50 - N&amp;Q Electronics
    <li>51 - DCC Supplies, Ltd
</ul>

<p>
Matt Harris improved the Windows startup scripts to 
put the messages.log log file and the Jython cache files
in the JMRI preferences directory. 
This lets JMRI run cleanly on Windows 7.

<p>
Nigel Cliffe and Mark Waters provided new definitions for the
Zimo MX620 decoder.

<p>
Dan Boudreau updated the operations tools so that you can specify car loads.

<p>
Matt Harris fixed a problem launching JMRI on a Windows 64-bit machine with
more than 2GB of memory installed.

<p>
Ken Cameron fixed a problem saving the powerline CP290 configuration.

<p>
The Linux startup scripts should now have executable permission set automatically.

<p>
Bob Coleman added Acela Signalhead support.  
Double and Triple will now work, 
but they send individual on and off commands rather 
than more optimal Acela signal commands down to the hardware.
So, added an Acela Aspect option that will do things efficiently 
for Acela and also correctly supports BiPolar and Wigwags.

<p>
Dan Boudreau updated the operations tools 
to allow the user to modify default load names for empty and loaded.
He also added the Schedule Table to Locations Tools.

<p>
Matt Harris made the startup scripts more reliable on Windows 98.

<p>
John Plocher updated the instructions for using Eclipse to build JMRI.

<p>
Dan Boucreau added optional car load features to operations staging.

<p>
Andrew Crosland improved the CBUS and CAN utility tools.

<p>
David Duchamp added automatic setting of turnouts to Dispatcher

<p>
Bob Coleman did a lot of important work on improving the JUnit build tests for the operations feature.

<p>
Walter Thompson did a lot of work to improve sample scripts.

<p>
Jack Shall updated the "Lenz 54" decoder definition.

<p>
Tom Starbuck updated and organized the model numbers in the TCS BEMF decoder definitions.

<p>
A bunch more baud rates were added for CAN connections.

<p>
Paul Bender updated the XPressNet support to properly handle non-standard operations by the Hornby Elite. 
He also added a configuriation tool for the Lenz LI-USB.

<p>
Andrew Crosland improved the CBUS support and added a new "Event Table" tool.

<p>
Marc Fournier improved the TCS BEMF decoder definition.
