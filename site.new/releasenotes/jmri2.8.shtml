      Release Notes for JMRI 2.8 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MM NN, YYYY</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Production release 2.8 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b><p>

We are very pleased to announce that the 2.7 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.8" available for download today.

<p>
Among the enhancements since the last production release, JMRI 2.6, are:
<ul>
<li>
<li>
</ul>

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>Warnings for this version:</h3>

XML input processing was reworked in JMRI 2.7.8.  
This shouldn't have any impact
on users, but might effect people who have written scripts to 
read or write XML files. See the XmlFile JavaDoc for more information.

<p>
If you want to use the "Function Label" or "Roster Image" panes with the 
DecoderPro "Comprehensive" programmer format, you should change to using
the "Advanced" format.  You select this at the bottom of the window when opening
a locomotive for editing, or via the JMRI Preferences window.

<p>
Changes in JMRI 2.7.7 to the internal structure of the classes for the throttle windows (not the 
throttle classes themselves) may cause trouble for scripts that were using them.

<p>
JMRI 2.7.7 uses a different set of libraries for processing the XML panel files.
In turn, this means that if you've created your own startup scripts, you may need
to adjust them.

<p>
The new audio support in JMRI 2.7.5 requires some new libraries.
Those libraries are included in the JMRI downloads.  They, in turn, require that the
startup scripts include the new libraries, so these have also been modified.
The 2.7.4 and earlier scripts will not work with 2.7.5 and later.  In particular, if you've
created your own copies of startup scripts, you'll have to update those:

<p>
If your roster contains locomotives with Soundtraxx Steam Tsunami decoders,
you should migrate those roster entries to the new decoder definition names.
We've created a tool to make that easier.
For information on how to use that tool, please see the 
<a href="decoder2.7.5.shtml">separate note</a>.

<p>
JMRI 2.7.4 changed the way filenames for icons, etc, are stored in XML files by JMRI.
The advantage is that this new method will make it much easier to move 
panel files from one computer to another, even of a different type.  So long as you
keep all your files in the JMRI preferences directory on both machines, the files
should just move over without trouble.  The warning is that files written in this 
format will not be properly read by JMRI versions before 2.7.4.
This includes files
from earlier versions that are read by JMRI 2.7.4 or later and then written out again, 
as the program will update them to the new format upon storing them.

<p>
Nigel Cliffe added a SerialPortRFID.py script to allow MERG RFID equipment to be read into JMRI.

<p>
Pete Cressman made several improvements to the Panel Editor:
<ul>
<li>The icon editor's window title now shows which panel it's associated with.
<li>The Icon editors now reset to their default settings whenever opened.
<li>The "Add to Table" function of the Icon editors now has a button to enter the element. 
    The new entry is highlighted in the table before adding it to the panel.
<li>Sensor icons now have a text attribute to make them easier to use as buttons.
<li>Moving all the panel text to a properties file so it can now be translated.
<li>Having the image index only store user modified default icon settings.
</ul>

<p>
Pete Cressman improved Logix Conditionals by
<ul>
<li>Adding a state variable memory-to-memory compare operation.  Two memory values may be tested for: less than, less than or equal, equals, greater than or equal, greater than.  When one or both values is numeric, the test is numeric.  Otherwise the compare is lexicographic.
<li>The previous state variable "memory equals" comparing a memory value to a value, has been extended to test for: &lt;, &lt;=, =, &gt;=, &gt;.
</ul>

<p>
Dan Boudreau made some minor bug fixes in the operations feature: 
Locations window didn't always show the correct number of car and engine pickups for each location.
Small change in functionality, train reset no longer swaps car loads.

<p>
Internal Lights (IL1, etc) now support variable intensity.

<p>
The bug causing the program to hang when editing a Logix, Route or Light has been fixed.
(This fix was in JMRI 2.6.1, but not in JMRI 2.7.1)

<p>
Dan Boudreau added a new save panel feature.  
When saving a panel that already exists, the program now saves a backup copy of the panel in a directory called "backupPanels".  
The backup panel's file name is modified with the current date and time.

<p>
Added a new Panel Editor icon for Memory objects that lets you set and modify numeric values.
This is a simple initial implementation for values that range from 0 to 100, with more customization, etc, to follow
if people are interested in this.

<p>
Fix the script input window so that large scripts can be entered.  Once the initial text window is full, scroll-bars will appear.
Also, fixed a bug that could cause the "Execute" button to disappear.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added initial support for RFID tags to the operations database.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson updated the ECoS support for better turnout operation, 
and to add initial support for throttles to run locomotives through the ECoS.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson fixed a problem what would sometimes result in improperly disabled Logix and Conditionals.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added turnout monitoring to the ECoS support.

<p>
Support for "Lunar" appearance has been added to signals.

<p>
A new "Four Output Signal Head" is available. It uses a 4th lamp (bulb or LED) to 
show a Lunar or Flashing Lunar aspect.  The Logix/Conditional support has been updated
to work with this.

<p>
Pete Cressman improved the memory spinner icon.

<p>
In preparation for new Signal Mast support, we've changed the interface to talk about
Signal Heads instead of just Signals.

<p>
Fix a problem with PowerLine initialization that would prevent certain Light configurations from working.

<p>
Pete Cressman improved the Memory spinner icon support, allowed the Light icon to be edited,
and added methods for better control of the icon editor.

<p>
Fixed a problem that prevented TwoOutput and ThreeOutput signal heads from being edited from the Signal Head Table.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added fields for RFID to the operations code.

<p>
Sakae Akanuma provided a Japanese translation.

<p>
Fixed a problem that prevented panel files from JMRI 2.7.3 from properly showing certain icons.
(More detail:  If the file specified an icon location that started with "resource:resource", 
JMRI 2.7.3 would not locate the icon)

<p>
Pete Cressman fixed a problem that prevented the format of panel editor Sensor Icon text
from being properly stored and reloaded.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added initial support for managing the locomotive information in an ECoS command station.

<p>
Pete Cressman added a "Memory Input Icon" to the panel editor.

<p>
More fixes to the portable filename support.

<p>
Pete Cressman fixed a problem where a panel editor sensor icon would be triggered when you
opened its popup menu.

<p>
Pete Cressman fixed a problem storing and loading the new Memory Spinner Icon, 
improved some labeling in the icon selector, 
and added more controls to the memory icon popup menu.

<p>
When storing references to files, e.g. custom icons in panel files
if the file is stored in your home directory, JMRI will store a relative "home:" 
reference, in addition to the already-present detection for files in the
JMRI program and preferences directory. This makes it easier to move panel files
from computer to computer; just make sure you have the icons, etc, in the same relative
place on the two machines.

<p>
Ken Cameron added sensor support for X10 Powerline devices.  Once you have manually created
a sensor using the Sensor Table, changed heard on the powerline will adjust the corresponding
sensor's state.

<p>
Pete Cressman made some improvement to Panel Editor icon handling.

<p>
Pete Cressman added group icon capture and move in the Panel Editor.
When a panel in put in "repositioned"  mode, 
a click and drag that begins in an open area will draw a red rectangle.  
All the non-fixed icons captured within this "fence" can be moved as a group by 
dragging any one of the captured icons.   
"Non-fixed" means the icons that do not have their "fixed" or "locked" 
items checked in their popup menus.
A group of icons captured by the "red fence" can be aligned by their upper left corners 
horizontally or vertically by selecting the "Align Vertically", or "Align Horizontally" items 
in one of the captured icon's popup menu.  
These items appear only when the icon is captured.  
This alignment will only occur to the unfixed and unlocked icons.

<p>
Paul Bender fixed a problem with XPressNet throttle setup that was particularly problematic for Hornby users.

<p>
Ken Cameron improved his RobotThrottle script.

<p>
Dan Boureau added status information to the operations route table.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson improved the way we check for duplicate roster IDs to catch some additional
cases.

<p>
Paul Bender corrected a bug in XPressNet LI100 programmer which made it difficult to read 
multiple values from a decoder (single reads were ok).

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added a capability to connect locomotive information in the ECoS command station to JMRI.

<p>
Ken Cameron added a horn button to the RobotThrottle.

<P>
Paul Bender added some additional error messages to the DCC programmer.

<p>
Sakae Akanuma added a Japanese translation.

<p>
Dan Boudreau improved the NCE Show Cab feature.

<p>
Pete Cressman fixed a bug in the memory compare in Logix

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a bug with rotating square icons.

<p>
Ken Cameron updated his RobotThrottle2 and DebounceSensor scripts.

<p>
Pete Cressman improved rotations of icons to the panel editor, and 
added scaling and repositioning.
A new "Rotate (degrees)" item was added to the popup menu.  
The former "Rotation" item is now labeled "Rotate (Orthogonal)".  
"Rotate (degrees)" will rotate an icon an arbitrary number of degrees.  
Each "Rotation" item resets the other.  
The "Scale (percentage)" popup item enlarges or shrinks the icon by the percentage input.  
To scale and rotate, use "Rotate (degrees)".
A "Shift-Drag" feature allows repositioning of the icons in a layer beneath an icon, while holding the top icon in place.

<p>
Ken Cameron fixed the problem that would cause startup errors if you configure a clock (analog, digital or Nixie) to open at startup.

<p>
Matt Harris fixed the way the preferences store the GUI selection to avoid occasional problems.

<p>
Matt Harris added great new <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/Audio.shtml">Audio support</a>,
including a <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/AudioExample.py">demo script</a> that shows off many of the features.

<p>

changed the Lenz tab name to Bachmann, updated
dimensions and default values as per decoder manual and added factory reset menu items.

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a minor bug when building trains from staging tracks without engines.  
Builds would sometimes fail if the staging tracks didn't have engines.  
Fix now allows trains to be build from staging without requiring engines.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added a new "failedThrottleRequest" function to the core Throttle support, 
so that if System-specific throttles are unable to create a throttle, 
then the address is removed from the throttleListeners Hashmap, and hence prevents the DCC address being locked out.

<p>
Andrew Crosland added support for CBUS CV programmers.

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a minor operations bug to allow terminating a train into staging without an engine.

<p>
Paul Bender fixed an error when parsing an "unsupported command" XPressNet response message.

<p>

<p>
Pete Cressman fixed a bug in Logix support for Memories

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed the panel editor to allow the user to use the + and - functions to nudge labels.  

<p>
Kevin Dickerson reduced to one the number of times a function is sent to a decoder by an SPROG system, 
thus for sound functions it prevents the sound being repeated three times or a turnout being set three times.  

<p>
Dan Boudreau improved the operations "engine import" feature to check if the model exists.  

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added support for groups in the DecoderPro roster.

<p>
Ken Cameron updated the RobotThrottle2 script to solve the 'waiting for throttle' problem,
and to provide smoother stops.

<p>
Matt Harris updated the audio GUI to be compatible with smaller screens.

<p>

Label on the Layout Editor:
<ul>
<li>Set Fixed Size,
<li>Set Margin Size (Not available if the size is fixed)
<li>Text Label Background Colour
<li>Border Size & Border Colour
<p>
For the Memory Label he also added:

so that it can be converted and displayed as a text label instead of an icon.  
Formatting options are similar to that added with the positional label, 
default text will either be from the sensor username or that it blank then it will use active, inactive.

<P>
There is now a IMCURRENTTIME memory variable that contains the current fast time.

<p>
Matt Harris provided a new "<a href="../help/en/html/apps/SoundPro/SoundPro.shtml">SoundPro</a>" application.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson added support for icons to the roster, so you can associate images with your
locomotives.  He also updated the Throttle to display them, and provided a 
<a href="../help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/throttle/ThrottleFrame.shtml#prefs">throttle preferences panel</a> for controlling that.

<p>
Peter Ulvestad updated the Comprehensive programmer format to display built-in speed table information better.

<p>
Elmer McKay provided a nice help file describing how to start putting signals on your layout.

<p>
Dan Boudreau add two new operations tools for trains and locations.  
The "Modify Trains" and "Modify Locations" tools allows the user to quickly edit which car types a train or location will service.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added a function to allow the system throttle manager to notify software throttles that they have
lost control over the selected loco.

<p>
Jack Shall updated the SoundTraxx Diesel Tsunami definition to include the new ALCO 539 models.

<p>
Micheal Dunn and Peter Ulvestad provided a new definition for the MRC 1658 Sound Brilliance decoder.

<p>
The DecoderPro programmer definition files (in the xml/programmer directory) can now 
control whether the "Function Label" and "Roster Media" panes are shown.
By default, the Basic programmer and the Comprehensive don't show them.
If you want those two panes, start using the new Advanced programmer format.
"Advanced" is be the default programmer format, if you don't pick any other one.

<p>
Dan Boudreau protected the code against certain errors when reading old operations configuration files,
fixed a minor shutdown bug, and an issue when counting cars.

<p>
David Duchamp fixed a problem with processing continuing sense when editing turnouts in Layout Editor

<p>
Dan Boudreau added a operations tool to show cars for locations and tracks.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson improved how Layout Editor windows are loaded; 
changed the pop up to start and stop the clock so that it now works in the Layout Editor in the same way it does in the Panel Editor;
added code to enable a circle and elipse to be drawn for a track segments.

<p>
David Duchamp extended the Maple interface so JMRI can run multiuple Maple input touchpanels.

<p>
David Duchamp added "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Special Actions</a>"
to Transits.
These are actions that can be initiated automatically as a train running in automatic mode traverses 
the layout.

<p>
Fixed a problem loading SE8c signal head definitions that include comments.

<p>
Simple Signal Logic now remembers whether you entered a user name or system name, and will
use that same information in the future.  Previously, it converted whatever you entered into
a system name and remembered that.

<p> 
Lionel Jeanson made some more improvements to the throttle windows:
He added a ThrottleToolBar in order to get all throttles in one window (this involved some changes
to the internal structure of the code that may cause problems for scripts if they were using
the internal interfaces of the Throttles; please check your scripts).
He also added default background image for DCC addresses 0 and 3.

<p>
Update XML parsing routines to use Xerces-J library instead of Crimson.
This may require users who have created their own startup scripts to reference
the xercesImpl.jar file instead of crimson.jar.

<p>
David Duchamp fixed signal head placement problems in Layout Editor signal setup tool.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added some text formatting options to the Layout Editor.

<p>
JMRI SignalHeads are supposed to start up DARK, so that whatever controls them can 
then set their initial appearance.  SE8c SignalHeads were not doing that properly.
Both the internal appearance (e.g. what shows on icons), and the actual signal, should
now properly start at DARK.

<p>
Signal heads and Simple Signal Logic now remember whichever user name or system name you 
provide.  Previously, names would be converted to system names before being stored.
This is the first step in a general overhaul to get this behavior.

<p>
Paul Bender added a javadoc-uml build target to the Ant build.  
This uses UmlGraph and GraphViz to build UML class diagrams to include in the Javadoc.  
UmlGraph is included as a jar in lib, GraphViz will need to be installed.
This requires Java 1.6. You can check out the results via the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/uml">UML diagram listing</a>
on the JMRI web page.

<p>
Andrew Crosland updated the SPROG programmer to log an error if no programmer listener has 
been provided to the programmer, for example in a script.

<p>
Andrew Crosland added support for the CBUS DCC command station, CV programmer and layout power manager.

<p>
Peter Ulvestad provided a decoder definition for the MRC 1827.

<p>
The default memory limit on Mac OS X has been increased.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson fixed a problem with multi-sensor icons.

<p>
Randy McKenzie contributed some additional background images for CTC panels.

<p>
XML input processing has been reworked.  This shouldn't have any impact
on users, but might effect people who have written scripts to 
read or write XML files. See the XmlFile JavaDoc for more information.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added features to add locos to the roster from an Ecos
command station, and
to add locos from the Ecos to the Roster.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson fixed a problem using an SPROG command station with 
multiple layout connections.

<p>
Nigel Cliffe contributed an update for the CT Elektronik SL version 40
decoder definition

<p>
Nigel Cliffe contributed an update for the ZTC 471
decoder definition

<p>
Paul Bender improved error handling and reporting for the XPressNet ops-mode programmer

<p>
Giorgio Terdina added an Entry column to the Entry Point table in 
the Add/Edit Section window of the Section table 
to make it easier to set entry point direction.

<p>

<p>
Lionel Jeanson fixed the multi-throttle release issue in LocoNet by 
better monitoring slot status in LocoNet Throttle.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson made a number of internal changes to the layout and panel editors.

<p>
Peter Ulvestad updated the Atlas Dual Mode and four function (342 and 345)
decoder definitions to add
the factory reset and update some limits and defaults.

Kevin Dickerson improved the file-load dialog so that it doesn't give 
an error message if the user cancels the load.

<p>
Dan Boudreau made a small change in how operations staging works.  
Previously any car in staging could be assigned to a train.  
Now the cars in staging must also be serviced by the train being built.
Also, users can name tracks using -number suffix.  
Suffix isn't printed for manifests or switch lists.

<p>
Pete Cressman modified the create/edit dialogs for state variables and actions in Logix 
to organize them according to item type (e.g. Senors, turnouts, etc.).  
The column expandability  has been somewhat improved.

<p>
Pete Cressman added new sub-menu under "Tools - Tables" called "Occupancy Blocks".
This is a sub-system for defining  elements needed to run trains with 
automated commands through 
"<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/logix/Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>".  
Some of the features of Warrants are:
<ol>
  <li>Routes can be determined by merely choosing the start and end points.
  <li>Throttle commands are recorded in a "Learn Mode" that are then played back 
        for automated running.
  <li>Turnout and Signals are set automatically for automated running.
</ol>
Warrants need to have the layout decribed in terms of the elements defined by the 
Occupancy Block Table.
Although intended to operate with block detection, warrants can run trains without it, 
however in this case, there is no protection against misaligned turnouts or cornfield meets.  Detailed information can be found in the Help files on the Occupancy Block Table menu.

Giorgio Terdina provided screen icons for German signals.

<p>
Tjeerd Verhage provided an icon for our SourceForge.net page

<p>
Dan Boudreau added three additional sort options for trains in the operations code:  by route, departure, and destination.

<p>
Matt Harris updated the Audio package.

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a marker bug:  Opening and closing marker frames caused the number of markers created to increase by one each time the marker frame was reopened.

<p>
Dan Boudreau made an Operations enhancement.  When replacing an existing engine model with a new model, the new model will now take the old model's attributes of length, type, and horsepower. He also improved some of the build messages with regards to cabooses and cars with FRED, and made a minor improvement in build messages for engines.  Note that if the train requires 2 or more engines that they be in a consist.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson added a first Jynstrument for throttle tool bar, allows for USB devices throttle frame browsing and throttle pilot.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson fixed a bug in sensor icons.  When the icon was using
different size images for the four states, these used to be centered. 
Starting in JMRI 2.7.4, this was inadvertantly changed so that they were
aligned in the upper left corner.  This bug is now fixed, and the
images have been moved back.  This won't effect you if you're using
the (recommended) same-size icons, but if you're using different size 
icons and have created a panel since JMRI 2.7.4, you may have to revisit it.

<p>
Andrew Crosland changed the default power manager state for CBUS to agree
with the hardware.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson updated the eCos support to now include S88 sensors.

<p>
SE8c Signal Heads can now work with non-Digitrax layout connections.
There have been a number of changes to make this possible. 
In particular, the convention for system names for SE8c signal heads has
changed.  Existing ones (from saved layout files) will stay the same, but
newly-added signal heads will have the new names.

<p>
Added a sample script to run the Heljan container crane from the screen.

<p>
Brett Hoffman added support for mobile devices to control throttles 
through a wi-fi connection. 
The first use of this is the
<a nref="http://withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a>
for iPhone and iPod Touch.

<p>
For better Snow Leopard compatibility, on Mac OS X the JMRI applications
now pass the "-d32" option to the Java startup.
This will (usually) force Java into 32-bit mode.

<p>
Peter Ulvestad provided a decoder definition for the MRC Rapido Turbotrain.

<p>
Ken Cameron updated the RobotThrottle2 sample script.

<p>
Andrew Crosland changed the standard/extended address boundary in the SPROG throttle software to match the SPROG hardware.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson improved the code for saving panel files.

<p>
Brett Hoffman updated the WiFi communications code.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson improved the <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/throttle/ThrottleFrame.shtml">throttle help pages</a>
to include much more information about advanced features.

<p>Dan Boudreau made several improvements to the operations code.
You can now print your manifests using colors for the car drops and
pickups. You can now reset a train if you've modified the train's route
after you've built the train. And the car database is automatically
saved when you change the Car Types (Descriptive or AAR codes) in setup.

<p>
Peter Ulvestad improved the decoder definition for the MRC 1663 Atlas S2/S4 decoder.
