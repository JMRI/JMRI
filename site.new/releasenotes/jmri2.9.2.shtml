      Release Notes for JMRI 2.9.2 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM NN, 2010</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.9.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the second in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.10 (or perhaps JMRI 3.0) production release in Summer 2010. 

<p>
The only change in this test release is a new communications library, called "RXTX 2.2".
This new library is incompatible with the previous one, and required numerous code
changes in JMRI.  

<p>
Everything else in this test release is the same as the
<a href="jmri2.9.1.shtml">JMRI 2.9.1</a>
test release.

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

This version of JMRI uses different communications libraries.
On Windows, the installer should take care of all installation and deinstallation 
required.  On Mac, no actions are necessary, the new distribution directory
should just work.  On Linux, you may have to install and/or uninstall 
various communications library parts, see the
<a href="../install/Linux.html">JMRI Linux pages</a> for more info.

<p>
There is a known problem with SPROG Command Station Mode in this version.
If you use that, you should not install this version of JMRI.  Wait until
JMRI 2.9.3 is released with a fix.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

We recently discovered that the Lionel TMCC support has had serious bugs since
JMRI 2.4, and perhaps before that.  These are not fixed in this version, 
but will be fixed in JMRI 2.9.3.  There's a temporary patch available if 
these bugs are causing you problems.

<p>
The JInput USB library was updated to the current version in 
<a href="jmri2.9.1.shtml">JMRI 2.9.1</a>, which (should) 
have fixed problems on
Windows Visata, Intel Macs and some Linux machines.  We don't have a way to check this with all possible
input devices, so please check to make sure that your USB-attached devices still work.

<p>
When loading an older panel file containing signal head icons, you may
get WARN messages about "did not locate lunar icon file" and "did not locate flashlunar icon file".
To make these stop, just store the file again so that it's rewritten in the most recent format.
