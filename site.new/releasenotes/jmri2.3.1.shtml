      Release Notes for JMRI 2.3.1 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2008</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.3.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions.

It contains 
many new features, including:
<ul>
<LI>TBP
<!-- <li>Support for the new model railroad controls based on the  -->
<!--     <a href="../help/en/html/hardware/can/index.shtml">CAN bus</a>, -->
<!--     including CBus. -->
<!-- <li>Initial support for connecting a -->
<!-- <a href="../help/en/html/hardware/raildriver/index.shtml">RailDriver console</a> -->
<!-- as a JMRI throttle. -->
<!-- <LI>Several new and improved decoder definitions, -->
<!-- <LI>Many small improvements to the usability and reliability, -->
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.1 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.2" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>JMRI is moving toward requiring Java 1.5 or later.  Certain new features may not work if you are using an earlier
version of Java.  To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

<p>JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts. This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts. Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.2:</h3>


Ian Birchenough added a decoder definition for the Lenz Standard decoder.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added some support for accessory programming modes.

<p>
A decoder definition for the new Soundtraxx Diesel Tsunami is included,
thanks to information provided by Bruce Petrarca of Litchfield Station
and Nancy Workman of Soundtraxx.

<p>
More RPS support, particularly improvements to the tracking displays.

<p>
Ken Cameron added a "DebounceSensor" sample script.

<p>
The JMRI 
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/help/en/html/hardware/can/cbus/index.shtml">CBUS support</a>
now includes Senors and Turnouts.  Also, when using a non-MERG CAN adapter, the
CAN ID is fixed at 126.

<p>
The Turnout Control and Add Turnout window have been improved so the size of the text fields
for system and user names expand as the window is expanded.  This lets you
enter the really long names that some systems (RPS, CBUS) can use.  If this
works well, it'll be done for the rest of the places.

<P>
The JMRI throttle now was a "Program" button which opens an ops-mode programmer
window for the selected locomotive. It's only active when a roster entry
has been selected on the throttle.

<p>
Turnouts, Sensors, Lights, etc all now have an associated "comment" field
for recording whatever information you'd like.  You can enter the info
via a column in the associated table. It will be stored in panel files
along with the object's other information, and 
can be accessed via scripts, etc.

<P>
The JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/help/en/html/hardware/can/cbus/index.shtml">CBUS support</a>
now takes an easier format for specifying CBUS events in sensors
and turnouts:  MT2e3, which means "event 3 from node 2".
The CBUS
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/help/en/html/hardware/can/cbus/Names.shtml">naming page</a>
discusses various optional forms.

<p>
Jos Wils provided updated ESU decoder definitions, and extended the Comprehensive
programmer format to work well with them.

<P>
The JMRI 
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/loconet/sdfeditor/EditorFrame.shtml">editor for Digitrax SDF sound definitions</a>
has been updated with more editing options and some layout 
improvements.

<p>
Pekka Siiskonen suggested that we add "error numbers" to e.g. the
programming error messages, so that when people report a problem
it's really clear which error they've hit.  We've started to do this, 
including a 
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/help/en/html/Errors.shtml">page that serves as a central registry</a>
of error numbers.

<p>
Bob Coleman updated the CTI Acela support to include
all types of sensors and initial configuration of sensors and outputs.
He's also added the start of formal support for Acela Turnouts.

<p>
Ronnie Pinkerton updated the throttle so it uses screen space more efficiently.

<p>
David Duchamp fixed a bug in the screen grid of the Layout Editor.

<p>
A problem with indexed CVs (as in QSI decoders) and adding new entries
to decoder definitions has been fixed.

<p>
David Duchamp added an "edit" capability to the Signal Table, so
you can now change the details (but not the type) of a signal definition.
He also updated the help pages for signals and the Signal Table.

<p>
It was possible to select e.g. a background image while browsing panel
icons, which then was so large that it made the window unusable.  
This was fixed by adding scroll bars to the preview part of the window.

<p>
The layout for "Active DCC Address" was changed in DecoderPro to make it
more self-explanatory.

<p>
New 
<a href="">setup tool</a>
for CBUS users.

<p>
Editing text fields in tables has been a little frustrating because
when you tab into the field, a table didn't behave like everything
else in the program.  With most fields, if you start typing, it 
replaces the prior content.  In tables, the typing has been appended to 
the prior content.  This is now fixed; when you tab into a 
table cell, the current content is selected.  If you type e.g. without
setting the cursor, you'll replace the prior content.
