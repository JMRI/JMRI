      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2010</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.11.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fourth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.12 or 3.0 production release in 2011. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
</ul>
along with other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None yet)

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

There have been extensive changes to the throttle code.
If you have written scripts that use throttles, particularly
multiple throttles, please check to make sure they still work.

<p>
The numerical values of "ON" and "OFF" for Lights changed in JMRI 2.11.2, 
along with some of the other constants in the class.  
This will have no impact on people just using the program.  
If you're using scripts with numerical values
in them, please recode them to use the symbolic values.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since production version 2.11.3</h3>

<p>
New operations features and bug fixes:
<ul>
	<li>Cars with a final destination will no longer wander if the
	destination track doesn't have space for the car.</li>
	<li>The edit schedule destination track menu now shows only valid
	tracks. Staging tracks are no longer shown in the edit schedule window.</li>
	<li>The program will now check the entire schedule in match mode
	when generating custom loads from staging.</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor bug with switch lists, the location status
	wouldn't become "Changed" when there were only car pick ups.</li>
	<li>The switch list "Print Switch List Changes" now only shows new
	trains since the last printing.</li>
	<li>New "Set Cars" tool. Now you can set the location,
	destinations, and load for a group of cars.</li>
	<li>You can also decide to not modify the car's load status when
	using the Set Cars Tool.</li>
	<li>New car sort in the cars window, by car's final destination.</li>	
	<li>New build option, you can now optionally select the departure
	track from staging.</li>
	<Li>New operations feature. You can now optionally create a Comma
	Separated Values (csv) manifest file. Now you can use Excel to create a
	custom manifest to your liking. Files can be found in
	operations-&gt;csvManifests</Li>
	<li>A new capacity check has been added to limit overloading of a
	siding with a schedule in aggressive mode. Overloading a siding can
	still happen when using aggressive mode, but the overloading is now
	limited.</li>
	<Li>Bug fix. A car in a kernel with FRED must be the lead (*) car.
	When editing car with FRED and in kernel, the program will
	automatically make the car the lead.</Li>
	<li>Manifests and switch lists now block
	cars by kernel. The new blocking order is: first by road, then number,
	kernel, location and finally destination.  This should keep cars in a
	kernel together on the manifest and switch lists.</li>
	<li>You can now change the loco and car manifest and switch list pick up
	and set out prefixes, i.e. " [ ] Pick up".  See Setting-&gt;Tools Print Options.</li>
	<li>Users can now reset a train directly from the Trains window.</li>
	<li>You can now have operations windows close on save.  See Settings Options.</li>
