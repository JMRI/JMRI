      Release Notes for JMRI 2.5.1 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2008</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.5.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the first in a new series of test versions.

It contains 
many new features, including:
<ul>
<LI>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>JMRI now requires Java 1.5 or later.
If you are using an older version of Java, please
<a href="http://www.sun.com/getjava">upgrade your Java installation</a>.  
To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>Linux users, especially Ubuntu users, of Panel Editor and Layout Editor 
may experience trouble with displaying popup menus and  
repositioning items on their panels.  This is a known problem that is  
being worked on. It is expected to be fixed in an early 2.5.x test  
version.


<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

Windows desktop shortcuts have been restructured to make them more reliable.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be effected by this change.

<p>
Starting with the 2.3.4 test release, by default JMRI is allowed to use
up to 200MB of memory (up from a limit of 60MB or 64MB previously).
If this is more memory than you have available, and you notice JMRI
slowing down a lot, please let us know so we can provide a work-around.
<p>
Staring with the 2.3.3 test release, JMRI builds the classpath (the
list of .jar libraries used by the program) dynamically on Windows.  
We'll use this in the future for plug-ins and other features, and
other platforms have been doing this for a while.
If you have added any .jar files to your JMRI program directory, they
may cause problems when the program is starting.  Also, if originally
installed a very old version of JMRI, there might still be files around
that can cause this problems.
If so, you can fix it by moving aside those extra
.jar files from the JMRI program directory, or by asking Windows to un-install JMRI,
before reruning the installer.
For more information on this, please see this
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/message/35065">discussion</a>
on the 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">jmriusers mailing list</a>.


<p>JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts. This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. 
We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts. 
Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and if so a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.

<h3>Changes since production version 2.4:</h3>

Fixed an error with the Digitrax SoundLoader if you cancelled before opening a file.

<p>
Reformatted the DecoderPro speed table to fit better on narrow screens.

<p>
Update Throttle 
"<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/throttle/ThrottleFrame.shtml">Edit Throttle Frame</a>" so user is less likely
to enter a new frame title and not have it appear.

<p>
Several technical updates were made. These shouldn't effect users, but
things don't always go perfectly...
<ul>
<li>Standard build for debugging now uses Java 1.5, builds Java 1.5 classes.
    This required some minor code edits to remove warnings.s
<li>Removed obsolete methods from Routes, deprecated since JMRI 1.7.6
<li>Removed varoius Ugly Hacks associated with the JSpinner class not being
    available in pre-1.5 JVMs.  This changed Thottle, Turnout Operations, LocoNet Over Tcp.
<li>
</ul>

<li>
Dan Boudreau added two new features to the operations code: 
<ul>
<li>The  ability to copy a route.  
<li>The ability to control whether there are car drops and pickups at a location in a route.
</ul>

<p>
A duplicate definition for the Hornby 8215 was removed.

<p>
Much internal work on handling multiple types of programmers.
The first indication of this at the user level is in the "Single CV programmer",
which now will let you pick a programmer if more than one is present.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added an
