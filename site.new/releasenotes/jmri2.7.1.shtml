	<p>Date: June 9, 2009</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.7.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.8 production release in December 2009. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->
