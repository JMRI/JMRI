      Release Notes for JMRI 2.12 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2011</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Production release 2.12 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

We are very pleased to announce that the 2.11 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.12" available for download today.

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None yet)

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

Development Version 2.11.4 contains significant improvements to the Powerline Interfaces. 
Some of these improvements involved a complete restructuring of the underlying code. 
As a result, previously working Preferences may now show no connections for some of the Powerline Interfaces. 
If this occurs, go to Preferences and setup the Powerline Layout Connections again. 
Then save the Preferences and restart JMRI.

<p>In Development Version 2.11.3 JMRI instituted a more robust and
transparent system for handling missing panel icon files. If missing
icon files are discovered during the panel loading process this system
presents a dialog box that allows the user to either delete the
offending reference or use the file browser to find the proper location.
Older versions of JMRI didn't always fully remove the references to
deleted panel icons. Panels which contain these stray references will
present the dialog box during the first panel load. If the panel worked
fine before, simply choose the delete option for each "missing" icon
presented to remove the stray references. Once the panel has finished
loading, save/store the panel file, quit JMRI and then reload. As a
precaution, we recommend either making a backup copy of your panel file
before diving in or saving the modified file under a different name</p>

<p>There have been extensive changes to the throttle code. If you
have written scripts that use throttles, particularly multiple
throttles, please check to make sure they still work.</p>

<p>The numerical values of "ON" and "OFF" for Lights changed in JMRI
2.11.2, along with some of the other constants in the class. This will
have no impact on people just using the program. If you're using scripts
with numerical values in them, please recode them to use the symbolic
values.</p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since production release 2.10</h3>

<p>
Robin Becker 
<ul>
<li>fixed the JmriJFrameServlet.sendClick support in the mini web server
to properly support objects within Components such as Tables and Sliders. 
<li>Added support for RadioButtons and CheckBoxes, tested with Turnout Table and Throttle tools on IE8 and Firefox.
</ul>

<p>
Paul Bender
<ul> 
<li> updated the XPressNet adapter code to allow multiple connections.
<li> Made bug fixes to the following XPressNet Throttles
<li> updated EasyDCC consist support
<li> made some internal improvements to the XPressNet support.  If you've 
written scripts that directly use the XPressNet communications, you may 
have to revisit them.
<li> Added two new scripts:
<ul>
<li> ThrottleBridge.py is a proof of concept script showing how to bridge a throttle
from one system to another.
<li> ConsistExample.py showes how to add and remove a consist
</ul>
<li> updated how the throttles handle notifications internally.
<li> updated the error checking in the JMRI consisting tool.
<li> added a Consist Manager for LocoNet with the following notes on it's current capabilities and known issues:
<ol>
<li> Basic functionallity of adding and removing locomotives from consits is working.
<li> The check boxes for changing the direction of a locomotive within a
consist are not working
<li> The delete button at the bottom of the consist tool does not work correctly.
<li> You cannot currently add an existing lead address (created with the tool)
to another consist.
<li> The consist manager does not currently examine the slots for consists
</ol>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
Leo Bicknell 
<ul>
<li>improved the LocoNet monitor:
<ul>
<li>Adds symbolic names for the 0xD7 and 0xDF opcodes.
<li>Tweaks a number of messages so they are easier to read, provide more useful information.
<li>Reformats the fast clock query and response commands to make them clearer and take up less space.
<li>Reworked the sensor reporting code to allow it to properly convert sensor numbers to DS-64 inputs and be much easier to understand.
<li>Reworked the sensor probe decode to report which sensors are being probed, rather than the esoteric "bits a/c/b" information.
<li>Added in a decode for what I call the PANEL QUERY (0xDF opcode).
<li>Added in a decode for what I call the PANEL RESPONSE (0xD7 opcode). [Tested against UR-91 and UR-92, but not UR-90.]
<li>I found the slot read/write stuff totally unclear, so I modified some of the terms and how it prints out and got what I think is a much clearer output.
<li>Added decodes for the Duplex Group Name query and response.
<li>Added decodes for the Duplex Group Channel query and response.
<li>Added decodes for the Duplex Group Password query and response.
<li>Added logic in the SEND IMMEDIATE decode to decode F-keys F13..F28 and print something nice.
<li>Made numerous improvements in internal structure and documentation
<li>Corrected the inconsistency of "." or no "." on messages to always have a ".".
<li>Better report a request for Command Station OpSw values (slot=127).
<li>Annotated things that were reverse engineered.
<li>Removed unnecessary dest address from DISPATCH PUT display.
<li>Prefixed LONG_ACK a few places it was missing.
<li>Improved decode of switch status broadcast, even though I've never seen anything send one.
<li>Changed OPC_PANEL_RESPONSE to indicate if it was duplex capable, if we're interpreting that bit correctly.
<li>Included a long form decode of Command Station OpSw reponses.
</ul>
<li>fixed a presentation problem in the LocoNet ID tool
</ul>

<p>Dan Boudreau made many enhancements to operations.</p>
<ul>
	<LI>Changed the track type "siding" to "spur" to better represent
	a track that serves an industry.</LI>
	<li>The operations program now supports car routing. The program
	will now use up to 5 trains to move a car from one location to another.
	Routing through staging tracks is disabled by default.</li>
	<li>A new feature, "Return When Empty" is now available. When a
	car's load changes to empty, the car can optionally return to a
	location or location/track.</li>
	<li>UK support been improved.</li>
	<li>Improved the build report messages.</li>
	<li>You can now specify a set out or pick up comment for a car based
	on the car's load.</li>

	misplaced, the program will not attempt to move the car. Also a list of
	misplaced cars is now appended to manifests and switch lists.</li>
	<li>Schedules can now delay a car's pick up from a spur.</li>
	<li>New feature, car loads can now have a low or high priority.
	High priority loads are serviced before low priority loads.</li>
	<li>New feature, "Timetable" under Trains-&gt;Tools. Allows you to
	quickly set which trains will run on any given day of the week.</li>
	<li>New tool "Routes-&gt;Tools-&gt;Set Train Icons Coordinates", you can

	Route", you can now visually update train icon coordinates for a route.</li>
	<li>New route feature. You can now specify additional wait time
	in a route. This allows you to adjust a train's manifest arrival times
	to your liking.</li>
	<li>New route feature. You can now set a departure time anywhere
	in a route. Nice feature for passenger trains!</li>
	<li>New route feature. You can now add an optional comment to each
	stop in a route. Comments will show up in your manifests.</li>
	<li>You can now decide to print location comments on the train's
	manifests. See Trains-&gt;Tools-&gt;Print Options.</li>
	<li>New build option, "Settings-&gt;Tools-&gt;Options". You can
	now allow local switcher moves between spurs, yards, and interchanges.</li>
	<li>You can now configure if staging tracks are restrictive.
	Default is restrictive. Option is under Settings-&gt;Tools-&gt;Options. See help for
	more info.</li>
	<li>New operations panel feature, you can now move a train anywhere
	in the route via the train icon popup menu. Select Route in the popup
	menu, then the next location desired.</li>
	<li>Improved the way the code handles switching from descriptive
	to AAR car types.</li>
	<li>You can now use a text editor to preview a train's build
	report. Unfortunately, this feature requires java 1.6. and is currently
	disabled for general release. Contact Dan Boudreau by email if you want
	a jmri.jar file that has this feature.</li>
	<li>You can now customize the order in which loco and car
	attributes are printed on manifests and switch lists.</li>
	<li>A train's total weight calculation is now based on whether the
	cars are loaded or empty.</li>
	<li>You can now define a car as being a passenger car. A
	passenger car's weight doesn't change with load. Passenger cars are
	placed towards the rear of a train.</li>
	<li>Add some additional fonts for operations.</li>
	<li>You can now modify and save column widths for the Cars and
	Engines tables.</li>
	<li>New tools to print trains and locations by car types. See Tools under "Modify Trains/Locations by Car Type";</li>

	load status for train and track.</li>
	<li>Operations enhancement, in the Trains window, user can select
	"Show All" or "Show only build trains".</li>
	<li>Operations enhancement, now the user can sort trains by
	status.</li>
	<li>The program now modifies all cars in kernel when using custom
	loads from staging.</li>
	<li>You can now preview or print out the car loads for the
	various car types. This feature can be found in the Edit Car
	Loads-&gt;Tools</li>
	<li>You can now control which staging track a train will use.  You can also have
	the program prompt you for a departure track from staging.  See Settings Tools-&gt;Options.</li>
	<li>Provided a new operations sample script to deselect the train
	build button when a train terminates: OperationsDeselectBuild.py</li>
	<li>Users can now run scripts after operation files have been
	loaded, and users can run scripts when the Trains window is closed.</li>
	<li>The program now checks car and loco length field during file
	imports.</li>
	<li>You can now select where to place the backup operations
	files. See Settings Tools-&gt;Backups and Restore.</li>
	<li>The program now routes cars from staging with a custom load to
	a spur with a schedule demanding that car type and load.</li>
	<li>When printing car locations you can now optionally have a
	space or page break after each set of locations.</li>
	<li>New manifest print option, you can now show destination and
	track when picking up a car.</li>
	<li>Schedules can now operate in two modes, sequential or match.
	Use match mode when you don't care about car order.</li>
	<li>New optional train requirements, you can now have two
	locomotive changes in the train's route, or request helper service.</li>
	<li>Cars with a final destination will no longer wander if the
	destination track doesn't have space for the car.</li>
	<li>The edit schedule destination track menu now shows only valid
	tracks. Staging tracks are no longer shown in the edit schedule window.</li>
	<li>The program will now check the entire schedule in match mode
	when generating custom loads from staging.</li>
	<li>The switch list "Print Switch List Changes" now only shows new
	trains since the last printing.</li>
	<li>New "Set Cars" tool. Now you can set the location,
	destinations, and load for a group of cars.</li>
	<li>New car sort in the cars window, by car's final destination.</li>
	<Li>New operations feature. You can now optionally create a Comma
	Separated Values (csv) manifest file. Now you can use Excel to create a
	custom manifest to your liking. Files can be found in
	operations-&gt;csvManifests</Li>
	<li>A new capacity check has been added to limit overloading of a
	spur with a schedule in aggressive mode. Overloading a spur can
	still happen when using aggressive mode, but the overloading is now
	limited.</li>
	<Li>Enhancement. A car in a kernel with FRED must be the lead (*)
	car. When editing car with FRED and in kernel, the program will
	automatically make the car the lead.</Li>
	<li>Manifests and switch lists now block cars by kernel. The new
	blocking order is: first by road, then number, kernel, location and
	finally destination. This should keep cars in a kernel together on the
	manifest and switch lists.</li>
	<li>You can now change the loco and car manifest and switch list
	pick up and set out prefixes, i.e. " [ ] Pick up". See
	Setting-&gt;Tools Print Options.</li>
	<li>You can now reset a train directly from the Trains window.</li>
	<li>You can now have operations windows close on save. See
	Settings Options.</li>
	<LI>Enhancement to the "Set Cars" tool. You can now ignore
	selected fields when changing a group of cars.</LI>
	<LI>You can now optionally select which trains can set out and
	pick up cars from a spur.</LI>
	<LI>Car routing enhancement, program now checks the number of
	available moves when determining if a train can service a car.</LI>
	<LI>Improved how the program set outs cars when there's two or
	more stops at the same location. There is now a bias to set out the
	cars at the earlier stop.</LI>
	<LI>New schedules enhancement, uses can optionally control a
	schedule using the train timetables. For example you can now deliver a
	car to a spur based on the day of the week.</LI>
	<LI>The trains window now shows which timetable is active.</LI>
	<LI>Spur/schedule enhancement. When a car is placed at a spur
	with a schedule the car's destination isn't immediately set, only the
	car's final destination. This should eliminate overloading at spurs
	with schedules when in aggressive mode.</LI>
	<LI>Car forwarding enhancement when a car has a final destination.
	Now when the destination track is full, the program will determine if a
	yard track at the destination is available, and deliver the car to the
	yard track. The car will remain at the yard track until the spur
	becomes available.</LI>
	<LI>The program will now warn you if you haven't saved your files
	before doing a backup.</LI>
	<LI>You can now use the wild card "*" when using the "Find" button
	in the cars and locomotives windows. For example, if you wanted to find
	all cars with road numbers that ended with 456, you would enter *456.</LI>
	<LI>Fixed a problem when a spur has a schedule and a group of
	cars (kernel) was placed at the spur. Sometimes the car load wasn't
	updated properly. Thank-you Frank Wyatt for bring this to our
	attention.</LI>
	<Li>Changed the order of the location comment when there's no work
	at a location. The location and route comments now come after the "No
	work statement".</Li>
	<LI>Added some additional comments in the build report with
	regards to car routing. Messages are now in the build report. Messages
	to the console have been removed.</LI>
	<LI>Fixed a problem with switch lists showing loco pick ups when
	there wasn't. This happened when the switch list was printed when the
	locos were at that location.</LI>
	<LI>New feature, train logging. In addition to car and loco
	logging, the program can now log train activity.</LI>
	<LI>Operations manifest and switch lists enhancement, users can
	now specify local car message format and color, see Print Options for
	details.</LI>
	<LI>Program now remembers a car's previous final destination when
	reseting a train. Now when you reset a train and the car destinations
	that were set by a schedule will remain.</LI>
	<LI>Improved how tracks with setting FIFO and LIFO behave.
	Previously if the program couldn't find a destination for a car, all
	cars behind that car were stuck. Now the program will jump over a car
	that can't move.</LI>
	<LI>Train manifests now correctly show trains length and weight
	when there are loco changes in route.</LI>
	<LI>New feature, you can now enter a cost value for your cars and
	locos. Nothing to do with operations, but nice to have.</LI>
	<LI>You can now delete a schedule directly from the schedules
	window.</LI>
	<LI>You can now specify an alternative track for spurs with
	schedules. See Tools-&gt;Options in the Schedule window.</LI>
	<LI>Improved car import by allowing users the option of having the
	program automatically create new locations and tracks during the car
	import.</LI>
	<LI>Print car and loco roster can now show the value field.</LI>
	<LI>Export car and loco now exports the value field.</LI>
	<LI>Switch lists now show the train's arrival and or departure
	direction.</LI>
	<LI>Improved how custom car loads are generated from staging when
	using match mode, and "Generate custom loads for train spurs serviced
	by this train".</LI>
	<LI>Fixed some of the operations windows so the input text fields
	now work correctly when using large font sizes.</LI>
	<LI>New feature, the ability to pool a set of tracks to share
	their lengths. See under Edit Track, Tools-&gt;Pools.</LI>
</ul>

<p>

<ul>
    <li>updated the RR-CirKits Tower Controller 64 decoder definition
    <li>Added the CSX-1998 Signalmasts</li>
    <li>Updated the AAR-1946 Signalmasts to work with the Signalling Logic.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Graeme Brown provided updates for NCE decoders

<p>
Alain Carasso 
<ul>
<li>contributed decoder definitions for Arnold - Rivarossi and Mistral Train GOLD decoders.
<li>contributed a definition for the ESU Bachmann 3 function decoder
and the ESU LokPilot Basic 2.0.
<li>added the latest version of Roco 10745 decoder, 
more sophisticated than Lokpilot Basic, but less than full Lokpilot one,
and also a 10745 Roco decoder file (no long address settings).
<li>provided a Version 7 decoder definition for the Mistral Gold decoder:
some additional CV are made available starting with SW Version 7. 
Additional or changed comments added. Decoders with SW version 7 or higher are detected as V7, 
if SW version is 5 or 6, they are detected as V6, using previous version included in JMRI2.11.1.
</ul>

<p>Chuck Catania contributed a new set of 
SPTCO-1930 signal aspects.

<p>John Crellin</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributed a decoder definition for the MRC 1902 sound decoder.
<li>Corrected and added function labels in the MRC 1806 decoder definition and added MRC 1805 to that definition file.
<li>Corrected and added function labels in the MRC 1820 decoder definition.
</ul>

<p>
Nigel Cliffe 
<ul>
<li>contributed a decoder definition for the MERG ACC5 decoder
and did a major update to the MERG ACC4 decoder definition.
<li>Changes to CT SL51/SL75 Decoder Definitions file:
Added "alt" function key to function mapping, 
which opens up access to sound slots 9-16. 
Minor changes to labels and other function mapping details 
associated with this new discovery.
<li><blockquote>
Zimo sound decoders allow the end user to select the sounds played, and their volumes, from any of those stored on the decoder. As an example, this allows the user to change the horn, or brake noises, as well as set the sound levels for each element. This is done using a technique Zimo call "psuedo programming". An Ops-mode CV change to CV300 is made to enable pseudo programming, then function keys select various sounds. The throttle speed control acts as a volume control. Some function keys will end the programming (as will issuing a new Ops-Mode change of the CV). 
The difficulty for end-users in this approach is that the initial selection of which ops-mode value to select is not obvious, the throttle function keys when mapped to the pseudo programming features are not intuitively laid out (may be OK on a Zimo handset) and pressing some functions can have unexpected consequences (turns sounds off for that aspect of the decoder!). 
<p>
The new &quot;Zimo_pseudo_programmer.py&quot; script is an attempt to make Zimo Pseudo Programming a bit easier for the end user. It can be seen as complimenting my earlier CV61 Zimo function mapping tool. (And perhaps one day, I will bring them together into a general Zimo programming aid tool !). 
<p>
Its been tested by a couple of Zimo sound users, and we found a bug in the Zimo decoder firmware which resulted in one feature being temporarily removed from the script pending a decoder update from Zimo.

<p>
<P>Dan Boudreau:
<ul>
<LI>Users can now adjust font size.  See Edit Preferences, Display GUI.</LI>
</ul>

New operations features and bug fixes:
<ul>
	<li>Cars with a final destination will no longer wander if the
	destination track doesn't have space for the car.</li>
	<li>The edit schedule destination track menu now shows only valid
	tracks. Staging tracks are no longer shown in the edit schedule window.</li>
	<li>The program will now check the entire schedule in match mode
	when generating custom loads from staging.</li>

	wouldn't become "Changed" when there were only car pick ups.</li>
	<li>The switch list "Print Switch List Changes" now only shows new
	trains since the last printing.</li>
	<li>New "Set Cars" tool. Now you can set the location,
	destinations, and load for a group of cars.</li>

<h5>2.11.5</h5>

<P>Dan Boudreau:</P>

<P>New operations features and bug fixes:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Enhancement to the "Set Cars" tool. You can now ignore
	selected fields when changing a group of cars.</LI>
	<LI>You can now optionally select which trains can set out and
	pick up cars from a siding.</LI>
	<LI>Car routing enhancement, program now checks the number of
	available moves when determining if a train can service a car.</LI>
	<LI>Improved how the program set outs cars when there's two or
	more stops at the same location. There is now a bias to set out the
	cars at the earlier stop.</LI>
	<LI>New schedules enhancement, uses can optionally control a
	schedule using the train timetables. For example you can now deliver a
	car to a siding based on the day of the week.</LI>
	<LI>The trains window now shows which timetable is active.</LI>
	<LI>Siding/schedule enhancement. When a car is placed at a siding with
	a schedule the car's destination isn't immediately set, only the car's
	final destination. This should eliminate overloading at sidings with
	schedules when in aggressive mode.</LI>
	<LI>Car forwarding enhancement when a car has a final destination.
	Now when the destination track is full, the program will determine if a
	yard track at the destination is available, and deliver the car to the
	yard track. The car will remain at the yard track until the siding
	becomes available.</LI>
	<LI>The program will now warn you if you haven't saved your files
	before doing a backup.</LI>
	<LI>You can now use the wild card "*" when using the "Find" button in the
	cars and locomotives windows. For example, if you wanted to find all
	cars with road numbers that ended with 456, you would enter *456.</LI>
	<LI>Fixed a problem when a siding has a schedule and a group of cars (kernel) was
	placed at the siding.  Sometimes the car load wasn't updated properly.  Thank-you
	Frank Wyatt for bring this to our attention.</LI>
	<Li>Changed the order of the location comment when there's no work at a location.
	The location and route comments now come after the "No work statement".</Li>
	<LI>Added some additional comments in the build report with regards to car routing.
	Messages are now in the build report.  Messages to the console have been removed.</LI>
	<LI>Fixed a problem with switch lists showing loco pickups when there wasn't.  This
	happened when the switch list was printed when the engines were at that location.</LI>
	<LI>New feature, train logging.  In addition to car and loco logging, the program
	can now log train activity.</LI>
	<LI>Operations manifest and switch lists enhancement, users can
	now specify local car message format and color, see Print Options for details.</LI>
	<LI>Program now remembers a car's previous final destination when reseting a train. Now
	when you reset a train and the car destinations that were set by a schedule will remain.</LI>
	<LI>Improved how tracks with setting FIFO and LIFO behave.  Previously if the program couldn't
	find a destination for a car, all cars behind that car were stuck.  Now the program will jump
	over a car that can't move.</LI>
	<LI>Train manifests now correctly show trains length and weight when there are engine changes
	in route.</LI>
	<LI>New feature, you can now enter a cost value for your cars and locos.  Nothing to do with
	operations, but nice to have.</LI>
	<LI>You can now delete a schedule directly from the schedules window.</LI>

</UL>

<p>Pete Cressman</p>

<li>Added an LRoute "Initializer".  Creates a Logix guaranteed to execute first
 for initializing sensors, turnouts and signals, avoiding thrashing of
 enabling Logixes at panel load time.</li>
<li>Help files updated for Warrants, ItemPalette, Control Panel Editor</li>   
<li>All known problems with the Abort command to Auto or Manual warrants fixed.</li>   
<li>Two or more warrants can be allocated when they have blocks in common as long as each
 can acquire its first block.  (An allocated warrant must always have a starting block under its control.)</li>   
<li>Dark blocks may used as starting and destination blocks.  They should be registered OBlocks without a sensor.</li>   
<li>Speed sampling interval changed to 500ms instead of 200ms when recording auto train scripts</li>
<li>Train name in loco icon follows progress on both record and playback of a warrant.<li>

<li>Added an option to have a throttle control panel automatically switch between regular and continuous speed slider when a decoder function is activated/deactivated (most decoders have a slow function for "shunting" mode where a continuous speed slider is more appropriate for speed control). (option accessible in throttle control panel property window)</li>
<li>Added possibility to customize throttle function buttons with images in throttle function button property window</li>
<li>Added ability to save customized throttle function buttons in regular throttle files</li>
</ul>
