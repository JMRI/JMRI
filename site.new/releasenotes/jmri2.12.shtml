<h3>Notes:</h3>

We are very pleased to announce that the 2.11 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.12" available for download today.

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None yet)

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

Development Version 2.11.4 contains significant improvements to the Powerline Interfaces. 
Some of these improvements involved a complete restructuring of the underlying code. 
As a result, previously working Preferences may now show no connections for some of the Powerline Interfaces. 
If this occurs, go to Preferences and setup the Powerline Layout Connections again. 
Then save the Preferences and restart JMRI.

<p>In Development Version 2.11.3 JMRI instituted a more robust and
transparent system for handling missing panel icon files. If missing
icon files are discovered during the panel loading process this system
presents a dialog box that allows the user to either delete the
offending reference or use the file browser to find the proper location.
Older versions of JMRI didn't always fully remove the references to
deleted panel icons. Panels which contain these stray references will
present the dialog box during the first panel load. If the panel worked
fine before, simply choose the delete option for each "missing" icon
presented to remove the stray references. Once the panel has finished
loading, save/store the panel file, quit JMRI and then reload. As a
precaution, we recommend either making a backup copy of your panel file
before diving in or saving the modified file under a different name</p>

<p>There have been extensive changes to the throttle code. If you
have written scripts that use throttles, particularly multiple
throttles, please check to make sure they still work.</p>

<p>The numerical values of "ON" and "OFF" for Lights changed in JMRI
2.11.2, along with some of the other constants in the class. This will
have no impact on people just using the program. If you're using scripts
with numerical values in them, please recode them to use the symbolic
values.</p>
