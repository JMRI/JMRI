      JMRI Hardware Guide: Using a USB to Serial adapter
      </h1>


<p>

If your model railroad hardware is supposed to connect
to a computer via
a traditional RS232 serial connection, but your computer doesn't
have any RS232 ports, what do you do?  This is becoming more common
as new computers are sold with USB ports instead of RS232 serial ports.

<P>
One solution is to use a "USB to Serial" adapter to solve this.
A typical unit is one of the ones made by Keyspan, e.g. one of their
<A HREF="http://keyspan.com/products/usb/USA19HS/">their USA19 series of adapters</a>.
Note that we recommend the Keyspan adapters; we use a Keyspan
19-series adapter during the release testing, and have found them to 
work reliably in all cases so far. 


<p>Other companies, such as 
<A HREF="http://www.belkin.com">Belkin</a>,
market adapters under their own name, and you can often find off-brand
adapters at your local computer store.

<P>
Before you buy any adapter, make sure that it will work with your particular
computer and operating system version.  The important issue here is the
"drivers" the computer needs to talk to the hardware adapter; some
adapter manufacturers only provide Windows drivers, which makes their
products useless to a Macintosh or Linux user.  Also note that 
MacOS 8/9 and MacOS X drivers are different, and can't be interchanged.  

<P>
Many DCC systems don't require very much of their serial ports, and in that
case any adapter will probably work. But some DCC systems require either special
baud rates and/or RS232 control leads that not all adapters can provide.  The
rest of this page addresses those special cases.

<A ID="MS100"/>
<h2>LocoNet via MS100 adapter</h2>

The MS100 requires a special baud rate that most USB to serial adapters
can't provide.  It also requires power to be supplied via the 
RS232 control leads.
<P>

The Keyspan 19HS adapters are known to work with the MS100.  We've
gotten reports of success from Windows 98, Windows XP, and MacOS 9 users.  
(Note that the MS100 doesn't work with MacOS X; this is not a 
USB adapter issue)  You'll have to get a special cable to connect the 9-pin
connector on the Keyspan adapter to the 25-pin connector on the MS100.

<P>There are other Keyspan USB adapters who are known to not
work with the MS100.  In particular, the Macintosh Dual Serial adapter
which provides two Macintosh DIN-8 serial ports does not provide 
the power needed by the MS100.
<A HREF="KeyspanUSB.html">(More details)</a>

<P>
Note that using a LocoBuffer is highly recommended instead of trying to get
a MS100 to work!

<P>
Users have reported that a Belkin adapter wouldn't work 
with a MS100
because it could not
provide the special baud rate needed.

<A ID="LocoBuffer"/>
<h2>LocoNet via LocoButter, LocoBuffer-II</h2>

For reliable operation, the various LocoBuffer interfaces 
require that the RS232 control leads provide flow control.
<P>
If you're ordering a 
<A HREF="http://www.rr-cirkits.com/LocoBuffer-II/locobuffer-II.html">LocoBuffer-II</a> 
from
<A HREF="http://www.rr-cirkits.com">RR-Cirkits</a>, 
you should probably order the 
<A HREF="http://www.rr-cirkits.com/description.html">package that comes with a USB to serial adapter</a>.
This package is known to work well,
and has great support.

<P>
The Keyspan adapters are also known to work with the LocoBuffer.  We've
gotten reports of success from Windows 98, Windows ME, 
Windows XP, MacOS 9 and
MacOS X users.
You'll have to get a special cable to connect the 9-pin
connector on the Keyspan adapter to the 25-pin connector on the 
original LocoBuffer; later models have a 9-pin serial connector.

<P>
We have also had a report that the "IConcepts" adapter, purchased
at CompUSA, works with Windows ME and Windows XP.

<A ID="LI100"/>
<h2>XpressNet via LI100</h2>

For reliable operation, the LI100 XpressNet interface
requires that the RS232 control leads provide flow control.

<P>
The Keyspan adapters are known to work with the LI100.  We've
gotten reports of success from Windows 98, 
Windows XP, MacOS 9 and
MacOS X users.

<A ID="LI101"/>
<h2>XpressNet via LI101</h2>

For reliable operation, the LI101 XpressNet interface
requires that the RS232 control leads provide flow control.

<P>
As yet, we've received no reports or success or failure from 
people using an LI101 with a USB to serial adapter.  More
information would be greatly appreciated.
