	    <H1>JMRI: XML Usage</H1>


<P>
JMRI uses XML for a number of purposes: 
to hold decoder definitions, for its
<a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">persistance system</a>
for configuration and panel information,
and to create parts of the web site from other files.
This page describes some aspects of this.

<h2>Access to File Format Definitions</h2>
JMRI uses DTDs to define the format of its files.
<P>
Those DTDs need to be available to the program when it
reads the files, as they define the default values of missing
attributes and other needed information.
<P>
In the JMRI distributions, these are stored in the 
<a href="/xml/DTD">xml/DTD</a> 
directory.  
Note that they are not stored in each directory
alongside the XML files. There are just too many 
locations to keep such a set of DTD files up to date.
JMRI itself, via the jmri.jmrit.XmlFile class, provides
support for locating those files when the XML parser
needs them.  
<p/>
Each file contains a DOCTYPE line that
specifies a DTD name. There are three different methods
used to locate the actual DTD file:
<ul>
<li>Web browsers look exactly where the DOCTYPE line specifies,
and must find the DTD there to function.
<li>JMRI 1.8 and earlier 
assumes that the name is relative to
the program's xml/DTD directory, and looks for it using that.
In practice, this allows two forms for the DOCTYPE line:
  <ul>
  <li>name.dtd
  <li>../DTD/name.dtd
  </ul>
Early XML files used both; the program itself could generate
either depending on the circumstances.
<li>JMRI 1.9.2 through 2.0 provide a more powerful DTD search
procedure using the 
<a href="/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/JmriLocalResolver.html">jmri.util.JmriLocalResolver</a>
class. It parses the
reference in the DOCTYPE and handles it in several ways:
    <ul>
    <li>If it's an HTTP URL, JMRI first attempts to
    find the corresponding file in the local distribution.
    If so, it uses the local copy, otherwise it attempts to load a copy
    from the Internet using the URL.
    <li>If it's a file path that starts with "../DTD/",
    JMRI looks in it's local xml/DTD directory for the DTD file.
    <li>If the path is just a filename,
    JMRI looks in it's local xml/DTD directory for the DTD file.
    <li>In any other case, e.g. a local or absolute pathname,
    JMRI looks there for the DTD file.  Relative pathnames
    are interpreted as starting from the JMRI install directory.
    </ul>
    If the file can't be found, the XML file isn't opened.
    <p/>
    These JMRI versions write just the DTD filename in the DOCTYPE
    line when writing XML files.
    <p/>
    This provides complete backward compatibility with existing
    files and older versions of JMRI back to 1.7.1.
    At the same time, since it can handle HTTP URLs even without
    an Internet connection, it allows us to eventually move forward.
</ul>
<p/>
The JMRI 2.1 test release series will eventually start 
writing HTTP URL DOCTYPE lines in it's output XML files.  These 
will still be readable by JMRI 2.0, the prior production version,
but will also allow us to version control the DTD files. We're going to
need that capability eventually, and this is a way to get to it.


<h2>Formatting with XSLT</h2>

The 
<a href="/xml/XSLT">xml/XSLT</a>
directory contains a number of XSLT transformations
that can be used to format JMRI XML files.
They are used in several ways, described here.

<h3>Web Pages from Decoder Definitions</h3>
There's an Ant build.xml file provided which
runs a number of transforms to create web pages from the
decoder files.  These are then uploaded to the 
<a href="/xml/XSLT/">web site</a>
as part of each release.

<h3>Viewing XML Files</h3>
There are also XSLT transforms that are
used as stylesheets when displaying a JMRI XML file
in a web browser.  
In most cases, they just provide a human readable form.
For decoder definition files, this goes further to convert
the file to a form which can be used to submit updates.
<P>
To ease this, JMRI writes a line like<br/>
<pre>
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/xml/XSLT/panelfile.xsl" type="text/xsl"?&gt;
</pre>
at the start of each file. 
When the browser encounters this, it loads the stylesheet from the main JMRI web server
and uses it to transform the XML file into HTML, which it then displays.

<h4>Use without Internet Access</h4>

If you don't have a web connection, or want to use a local copy 
of the spreadsheet for some reason, just
change the href URL.  For example, href="panelfile.xsl" would reference a local file 
in the same location as the file being viewed.
<p>
Note that there's a known bug in recent versions of Firefox that prevents 
it from loading the stylesheet from the Internet, even when access is available.
Normally, security requires that pages loaded from remote
locations (e.g. servers, not the local computer) are not allowed to reference
local resources (e.g. local files).  This prevents malicious pages
from accessing your local secrets.  
On the other hand, there's no problem with a local page referencing
a remote page; that happens all the time.   Unfortunately, the current
(December 2007) versions of FireFox have this backwards, allowing remote
pages to access local ones and preventing local ones from accessing
remote resources. This stops a local JMRI XML page from loading the
remote formatting information, and prevents the page from displaying.
Use the solution described above for the case of no access:  Put 
a copy of the stylesheet in the same directory as the 
file you want to display, and then edit the xml-stylesheet line to point
to that directly.
