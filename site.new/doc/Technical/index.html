This is the "technical" page of the JMRI website.  Right now, it's just a 
pile of various information.  Eventually we have to organize it!

<h3>JMRI project information (For people interested in how the software is being written)</h3>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/">Project page</A><P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/export/projhtml.php?group_id=26788">Statistics and links</A><P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/export/projnews.php?group_id=26788">News items</A><P>

You can download the most recent source code using:
<PRE>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri login
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri co all 
</PRE>
(If asked for a password, just hit return)
<P>

<H3>Source snapshots</H3>
Occasional snapshots of the CVS source
<A HREF="snapshots">are available</A>
for download as .zip files.   Note that these don't contain the .jar files, 
documentation tree, etc; they're just source files. You won't be able to compile them!

<h3>JavaDoc</h3>
<A id="javadoc">

We'll occasionally upload a set of JavaDoc pages
to the 
<A HREF="doc/">doc directory</A>.
Please expect these to be somewhat out of date with respect to the
actual code! 
<P>Starting points:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="doc/index.html">Packages</A>
<LI><A HREF="doc/allclasses-frame.html">Class heirarchy</A>
<LI><A HREF="doc/index-all.html">Name index</A>
</UL>

<H3>Intro to JmriDemo program structure</h3>

The JmriDemo program is just an example, but it's meant to be a good one.
<P>
The source for the main class currently lives in apps/JmriDemo/JMRIdemo.java,
which defines the main class as apps.JmriDemo.JMRIdemo.  
<P>
The demo main just creates the menubar, and populates if with the desired menus
and items. Each item as a "Action" class object associated with it, which does the
necessary initialization when needed.
<P>
Because we expect to have different interfaces in the jmrix package, the JMRI tools
don't directly create the interface objects they need.  Rather, they ask for instances
of interfaces. For interfaces in the jmri package, which might be implemented by
lots of different layout types, jmri.InstanceManager satisfies these requests.

<P>
More information on how things (e.g. objects representing items on the layout)
are named 
<A HREF="Names.html">is available on a separate page</a>.

<h2>Development tools</h2>
<A id="tools">

Although it's possible to build a Java project like JMRI with just a compiler,
we don't recommend it, and we've never tried it.  Why make things hard for
yourself?  Instead, we use a few freely-available tools to make our lives 
much easier.

<h3>CVS</h3>
<A id="cvs">
See also the 
<A HREF="CVSFAQ.html">CVS FAQ page</a>.
<P>
Our source code is distributed using CVS. If you want to work with the
code, a few minutes installing CVS is well worth it.  We're sorry, but
we just can't support other methods (sending .zip files, etc), as they're
just too error prone.

<P>
Many computers come with CVS installed, including Linux and MacOS X.
If you're using Windows, you will need to install a CVS "client" program like
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10072&release_id=24467">WinCVS</a>.
A recent version can be downloaded from: 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip</a>.

<P>
To get a copy of the source for your own use, you can use "anonymous checkout".
For a command line cvs client, make a new directory for the project,
change to it, and tell CVS you exist with
<PRE>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri login
</PRE>
This "login" line
is only needed once; after that, it is remembered on your local machine.  You may
be asked for a password. If so, just hit return, as the empty password will be accepted.
You can then get a copy of the code with
<PRE>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri co TARGET
</PRE>
where "TARGET" is either "jbuilder" or "ant", see below. 
<P>
If you're using a GUI-based client like WinCVS, pull down the "admin"
menu and select "command line" to get a place to type these commands.
On other computers, you can type them directly on the command line.
<P>
As the common code changes, you might want to update your copy to contain the 
lastest version.  To do that, use:
<PRE>
cvs update
</PRE>
Any changes will be merged into the files on your disk, and you should then be up-to-date
with your own changes still presetn.
<P>
Once you're working with the code, you'll probably create some improvements
you'd like to contribute back to the project.  This is where CVS has tremendous
advantages; with the appropriate permissions and commands, you can merge your
changes back into the common source automagically.  Contact us when you're ready to
do that.

<H3>Using JBuilder to build JMRI</h3>
<A id="JBuilder">
Development is currently done using Borland's JBuilder.  The Personal Edition
is available for free download at 
<A HREF="http://www.borland.com/jbuilder/personal/">http://www.borland.com/jbuilder/personal/</A>.
<P>
You may have trouble running an existing copy of JMRI or DecoderPro after installing
JBuilder.
The JBuilder install adds another version of Java and sets it as current.  When a 
Java program starts, e.g. DecoderPro, it looks for it's libraries in the current Java 
install.  So the files (from the original DecoderPro install) are still there, but it's looking 
in a different place now, and can't run.  Reinstalling DecoderPro will put the libraries 
in the current Java install, and should fix this.
<P>Once you have JBuilder installed, start it up 
once to go through the
licensing procedure. 
The steps to get a working project are then:
<UL>
<LI>Create a "project" directory.
<LI>In the project directory, do a CVS checkout of the "jbuilder" 
module from our repository (see above). This will create a "java" subdirectory 
where the JBuilder IDE will run, and load it with source, tests and resources.
It will also create and populate directories for xml and libraries in the 
project directory.
<LI>The personal edition of JBuilder insists that libraries be in specific place.
Because that place changes from computer to computer, we haven't been able to
create an installer smart enough to handle it. You have to do the following steps
manually, but just once per computer (if you check out a new copy of the source,
this should still be ok):
<UL>
<LI>Find the .jbuilder directory.  This is probably in or near your "home"
directory.  On a linux or MacOS X system, look in "~".  On Windows, you should
search for it.
<LI>In the java directory that you just checked out, there's a "lib" directory.
Copy that "lib" directory and its contents to the .jbuilder directory.
<LI>Check to make sure that the lib directory in the .jbuilder directory contains
the files README, Serialio.jar, collections.jar, 
lib/comm.jar, lib/crimson.jar, lib/jdom-jdk11.jar, 
lib/junit.jar, lib/log4j.jar, and lib/security.policy
<LI>In the java directory that you just checked out, there's a JMRILibraries.library
file.  Copy that file to the .jbuilder directory.
</UL>
<LI>Change to the newly created java subdirectory. Start JBuilder with the 
jmri.jpx file you'll find there.
<LI>Click run, and sit back to watch it go.
</UL>

<P>
JBuilder can become confused, in which case you'll have problems with seemingly
missing files, wrong class names, etc.  When that happens, remove the "classes"
folder from the project's "java" directory.

<P>The Personal Edition of JBuilder does not come with the ability to make
.jar files. (A .jar file is a "Java Archive", essentially a machine-readable
library. For example, the JMRI code is compiled into the jmri.jar file for execution.)
You can run the program from within JBuilder, but if you want to make a new jmri.jar
file to update a stand-alone copy, you need to:

<UL>
<LI>Change to the java/classes directory

<LI>From a Windows command prompt, execute the command
<PRE>
      jar cf ..\jmri.jar jmri resources apps
</PRE>
  (That 3rd item would be ../jmri.jar on Linux or MacOS X)
<LI>
This created a new "jmri.jar" file in the "java" directory of the project.  
Copy or move it to an existing JMRI directory and start the program, which should 
then be using your new code.
</UL><P>
Note 1:  The "jar" command is installed as part of a Java Software Development Kit (SDK), 
including the one installed with JBuilder.  If the jar command isn't found, search for 
a jar.exe file (any one will do, they're all the same for this purpose) and enter the 
entire pathname, e.g.
<PRE>
   C:\jdk1.3.1_04\bin\jar ..\jmri.jar jmri resources apps
</PRE>
Note 2:  If you leave a "jmri.jar" file in the java\classes directory by accident, 
it will be used instead of the class outputs of JBuilder.  This will have the effect 
of "I compiled my change, but it's not being used!" because the older version of a class 
in that jmri.jar file will be used instead of the new .class file you created by recompiling.  
Hence the recommendation that you create the new jmri.jar file one level up by 
specifying "..\jmri.jar" in the command.

<H3>Using ant to build JMRI</h3>
<A id="ant">
Those of you who prefer a command line approach might want to investigate "ant", a
better make-like utility for Java projects.  Ant is available for 
download at
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html/</a>. 
Install it, then:
<UL>
<LI>Create a "project" directory.
<LI>In the project directory, do a CVS checkout of the "ant" 
module from our repository. This will create a "java" subdirectory 
where Ant will run, and load it with source, tests and resources.
It will also create and populate directories for xml and libraries in the 
project directory.
<LI>Change to the newly created java subdirectory. To compile, type "ant compile"; 
to create a .jar file, type "ant dist". Note that you don't have to create the
.jar file to run the program.
<LI>To run the program, type "ant decoderpro" or "ant jmridemo", and sit back to watch it go.
<LI>To run the test suite, type "ant alltest".
<LI>To build a jmri.jar file, type "ant dist".
</ul>

<P>
Originally, I (Bob) used CodeWarrior on the Macintosh as a development platform. This handles
selective recompilation, etc, and provides nice IDE capabilities.  The debugger
part is just about unusable, however.  I'd be happy to send you a copy of the 
project files if you'd like to use CW.

<h3>Recommended Tools</h3>
<UL>
<LI>
We use CVS for code control. Linux and MacOS X systems come with an installed
version that will work well.
<P>
If you're using MacOS X, CVS may give you messages about ".DS_Store" files. These
are used to keep track of window layouts, etc.  To suppress these messages,
just create a file in your home directory called ".cvsignore" and add a line 
of ".DS_Store" to it (no quotes). CVS will then ignore all .DS_Store files in 
all of your checked-out directory trees.

<LI>
We use Java Swing for our GUI development.  It's a lot more powerful
than the original AWT, and the price is right. In particular, we
try to use the "Bean format" of setting and getting members, call-backs to
notify of changes, etc, to make it easier to build applications from JRMI components.

<LI>The Java communications toolbox (javax.comm) has worked fine on 
Macintosh, OS/2 and Linux for serial I/O. We hope it works fine on other platforms. 
For Windows, we had to move to 
the Serialio package from
<A HREF="http://Serialio.com">Serialio.com</a>
to be able to use the MS100 baud rate.  To do this, the 
jmri.jmrix.loconet.ms100.MS100Adapter class was converted to use
Java reflection to decide which whether the Serialio package is
available; on other systems, it uses javax.comm.
Note that our license for Serialio limits it to this use only;
we are not permitted to distribute the libraries for other purposes.

<LI>Originally, we used ErrLoggerJ for logging of messages, etc.  We're now
switching to log4j as it's both easier and more powerful.  To log messages
from a class named MyClass, add this to the bottom of the class file:
<code>
<PRE>
	static org.apache.log4j.Category log 
	        = org.apache.log4j.Category.getInstance(MyClass.class.getName());
</PRE>
</code>
Then for each message to log insert a line like:
<code>
<PRE>
	if (log.isInfoEnabled()) log.info("message");
</PRE>
</code>
Message types are "fatal", "error", "warn", "info" and "debug".
<LI>The 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">Java recommendations</A>
for names, formatting, etc are really useful.
If you find that you can't read a piece of code, these will help
make it better.
<LI>The Java collections (List, etc) are available in JMRI, because
we need them for various other packages.  Use them if you'd like; there 
are often better approaches than to make everything a Vector.
To ensure compatibility with Java 1.1.8, we use the 
older form of class names, e.g. "com.sun.java.util.collections.List".
For more info on compatibility, see
the
<A HREF="Java118.html">Java 1.1.8 compatibility</a> 
page.
<LI>It's really helpful to have tests for code, especially code that's
being built by several people.  We use JUnit for that; see the section
below.
</UL>

<h3>Threading model</h3>
The initial threading model for JMRI is quite simple: Everything happens in 
the GUI thread.  For example, once a 'message', e.g. a LocoNet packet, 
is accumulated in a separate thread, the message is processed in the 
GUI thread via:
<PRE>
	// message is complete, dispatch it !!
	{ 
	final LocoNetMessage thisMsg = msg;
	final LnTrafficController thisTC = this;
	// return a notification via the queue to ensure end
	Runnable r = new Runnable() {
		LocoNetMessage msgForLater = thisMsg;
		LnTrafficController myTC = thisTC;
		public void run() { 
				log.debug("Delayed notify starts");
           		myTC.notify(msgForLater);
			}
		};
		javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(r);
	}
</PRE>

<h3>Jar files</h3>
The various .jar files used in building the demos are available from the
<A HREF="JARfiles">JARfiles subdirectory</A>
and the "lib" package in CVS.

<h3>JUnit</H3>
Some of the classes have JUnit tests available.  For more information on JUnit, see
<A HREF="http://www.junit.org">the JUnit home page</A>.
A very interesting example of test-based development is available from 
<A HREF="http://www.objectmentor.com/publications/xpepisode.htm">Robert Martin</a>'s new book.

<h3>Other efforts similar to JMRI</h3>
The 
<A HREF="http://www.der-moba.de/Digital/">DER_MOBA digital project</a>
is working on a client-server system interface.  Much of their discussions
takes place on the 
<A HREF="news:de.rec.modelle.bahn">de.rec.modelle.bahn</a> news group.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.kamind.com">KAM Industries</A>
has created a layout-level communications interface. They've proposed it to the NMRA
for standardization.  A 1998 NMRA Convention 
<A HREF="http://www.kamind.com/Clinics/NMRA-98/NMRA-98_Train_Tools_API_files/frame.htm">clinic writeup</A> 
is available.  On their web pages, they refer to this as 
<A HREF="http://www.kamind.com/Products/ds_TrainSrv_060000.asp">"Train server"</A>. It appears
to be based on Windows-specific technologies. 

<P>
The 
<A HREF="http://members.home.net/rrsim/">RRsim group</a> 
wants to create more realistic simulations of railroad operations.  
They operate a mailing list. They've also
proposed a cab bus standard to the NMRA.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/4803/">Rail Command System</A>
is a mixed hardware/software layout automation project by F. Peterson. He's recently
moved to a client/server Java model.
