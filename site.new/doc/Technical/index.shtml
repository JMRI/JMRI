You don't need to work with your own copy of the JMRI source code, compilers,
etc if you just want to run the programs.  You can download completely 
built copies via the 
<A HREF="../../download">downloads page</a>.
But if you'd like to play with the code, or get a copy of the program
that contains updates since the last downloadable version was published,
this section of the web site will help you get started.

<h2>JMRI project information (For people interested in how the software is being written)</h2>
Links to the SourceForge pages:<P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/">Project page</A><P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/export/projhtml.php?group_id=26788">Statistics</A>,

<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&group_id=1">SourceForge Site Status</a>

<h2>Code</h2>
All of the JMRI code is available from CVS.  See the 
<a href="getcode.html">"Getting the code via CVS"</a> and
<a href="CVSFAQ.html">"CVS FAQ"</a>
pages for more information on how to do that. 

<h2>Building Your Own Copy</h2>

In addition to getting a copy of the JMRI source code and reading it,
you can also compile your own version of the program to run. You can
even include your own modifications if you'd like.

<P>
There several different ways to do this. If you're already familiar
with one of the popular "Integrated Development Environments" (IDEs),
look at the navigation bar to the left for instructions on how to 
build JMRI using
<a href="NetBeans.html">NetBeans</a>,
<a href="XCode.html">XCode</a>,
<a href="Eclipse.html">Eclipse</a> or
<a href="JBuilder.html">JBuilder</a>.
<P>
NetBeans provides a very convenient system for building, running,
and if need be debugging the program.  If you're not
familiar with some other method, we recommend trying 
<a href="NetBeans.html">NetBeans</a> first.
<P>
Alternately, if you'd like to edit code with your favorite text editor
and compile it from a command line, please see the page of instructions for
<a href="Ant.html">building with Ant</a>.


<h2><A id="contributing"/>Contributing</h2>

We encourage contributions of code, decoder definitions, improvements to 
web pages, etc, to the JMRI project so that 
we can distribute them to the rest of the community.
<P>
For your first small contributions, e.g. a new decoder file or small bug fix,
please fill out a new "Patches" entry on SourceForge using 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=26788&atid=388315">our patches page</a>
(click new on the middle-left, then fill out the resulting form).
You can attach the entire file there.  If it's multiple files,
and you're using an IDE like
<A HREF="">NetBeans</a>, it's very easy to create a "diff patch file"
to carry your changes, and that will save us a significant amount of
work merging them in.  Please see the 
<A href="NetBeans.html#patch">instructions for creating a patch file with NetBeans</a>.

<P>
It saves us a lot of work if, before you create and send the patch file, 
you make sure that your copy of the code is up to date, and that the
<A HREF="JUnit.shtml#run">unit tests<a/>
all work.
<P>
If you are doing a significant amount of development, please
contact us so the we can make it possible to directly
commit your changes into our CVS repository.
<P>
When you contribute your code to JMRI for the first time, 
we'll ask you to sign an assignment form that
allows us to register copyright on the code, and
gives us
unlimited-duration license to 
redistribute it consistent with the 
<A HREF="#use">JMRI licensing</a>. 
(We regret this paperwork, but
<A HREF="../../k/copycomparison.html">Matt Katzer's misuse of copyright</a>
makes it necessary).
If other people also
helped with the contribution, please let us know so
we can add them to the 
<A HREF="../../community/index.html">acknowledgements page</a>.

<h2><A id="use"/>Licensing</h2>

We encourage people to build their own projects on top of JMRI.  That's the original reason
that the project was started!

<P>
JMRI is licensed only under the "General Public License", sometimes called the "GPL".  
We use version 2 of the license, along with the "classpath exception"
allowing people to link JMRI with their own code under more relaxed conditions.
Copies of the license are distributed with the source and executable downloads,
and can be gotten from 
<A HREF="COPYING">the web</a>. 

<P>
This is both an "open source" and a "free" license.
For more information
on those definitions, please see the
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>
web pages, including their
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">description of what Open Source means</a>,
and the 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> web pages, particularly their 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">licensing page</a>.
<P>
Informally, the license means that there are only a few limitations on what you
can do with JMRI.  (Check the exact wording in 
<A HREF="COPYING">the license</a>
for the details behind the following summary):
<UL>
<LI>You can redistribute it, for free or for a charge to cover your costs.  
<LI>You can 
build additional programs on top of all or part of JMRI, and distribute JMRI with them.
This is OK whether or not you charge for your program.
<LI>You can modify the JMRI code for your own purposes.  
<LI>You can distribute that modified code,
though in that case you either have to make your modifications available to us, or
also distribute an unmodified version at the same time.
<LI>
You cannot use part or all of JMRI in another project 
without either giving credit to JMRI, or making special arrangements with us.
<P>
This includes decoder definition files:  You are welcome to use them, including
reformatting their content to another form, but you must give JMRI credit for 
their content.
</UL>

If you have any questions about this, please

directly.
