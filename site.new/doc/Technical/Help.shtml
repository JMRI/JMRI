		    <H1>JMRI: Use of JavaHelp</H1>

This page talks about technical aspects of how JMRI provides help
information using JavaHelp and JHelpDev.


<h2>Organization of the help files</h2>

The help files are located in the "help" directory
within the JMRI distribution directory.
<P>
Within that, all the English-language files are located
within the "en" subdirectory.  Eventually, this will
let us internationalize the help pages.
<P>
Within that, there are several file trees:
<UL>
<LI>package - organized like the source package tree,
this contains code-specific help files for e.g. a particular
window or component.
<LI>html - general descriptions, organized in a similar way to the
main web site. Note that because of limitations to the JavaHelp 
HTML, you can't just take pages directly from the main web site.
<LI>DecoderProManual - a version of the DecoderPro manual reformatted for 
use in the help system.
</UL>

<h2>Access in the code</h2>

Within the JMRI code, access the help system comes
via the jmri.util.HelpUtil class.
(For historical reasons, there's a little bit of code
in apps.Apps, but you should ignore that).
<P>
The easiest way to add a help menu to a 
frame is to have it be a JmriJFrame (which you 
should do anyway), and call addHelpMenu(...)
after you've built any other menus.

<h2>Creating the control files with JHelpDev</h2>

JavaHelp uses various XML files to 
control how the table of contents and index are displayed.
We create those with
<A HREF="http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev</a>.
Please don't edit them manually.
