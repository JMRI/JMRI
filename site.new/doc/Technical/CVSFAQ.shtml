	    <H1>JMRI: CVS FAQ</H1>
This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions for CVS, particularly regarding how
we use it with JMRI.

<P>
See also the 
<A HREF="index.html">Technical index</a>
for more information on maintaining JMRI code.


<h3>How do I get a copy of CVS?</h3>
<A id="cvstool"/>
Many computers come with CVS installed, including Linux and MacOS X.
If you're using Windows, you will need to install a CVS "client" program like
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10072&release_id=24467">WinCVS</a>.
A recent version can be downloaded from: 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip</a>.

<h3>How can I get my own copy of the JMRI code?</h3>
<A id="jmrisource"/>
To get a copy of the source for your own use, you can use "anonymous checkout".
For a command line cvs client, make a new directory for the project,
change to it, and tell CVS you exist with
<PRE>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri login
</PRE>
This "login" line
is only needed once; after that, it is remembered on your local machine.  You may
be asked for a password. If so, just hit return, as the empty password will be accepted.
You can then get a copy of the code with
<PRE>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri co all
</PRE>
<P>
If you're using a GUI-based client like WinCVS, pull down the "admin"
menu and select "command line" to get a place to type these commands.
On other computers, you can type them directly on the command line.

<P>
For more information, see the page on 
<A HREF="getcode.html">getting your own copy of the source code</a>.

<h3>What are those lines like <i>$Revision: 1.1 $</i> and <i>$Id: CVSFAQ.shtml,v 1.1 2007-07-15 04:47:06 jacobsen Exp $</i>?</h3>
<A id="refid"/>

Those are automatically updated by CVS every time a new version of the 
file is checked-in to the repository.  Please don't edit them!!!
If you contribute your changes to the project, those line have to be
intact in the contributed file.

<h3>How do I update an existing copy of the source to the current version?</h3>
<A id="update"/>
As the common code changes, you might want to update your copy to contain the 
lastest version.  To do that, use:
<PRE>
cvs -q update
</PRE>
Any changes will be merged into the files on your disk, and you should then be up-to-date
with your own changes still present.  

<P>
The "-q" option removes a lot of
informational messages as CVS enters the various directories in the 
project; the command still works if you omit it, but it will be harder to
see any real error messages.

<h3>What are these messages about .DS_Store files?</h3>
<A id="ds_store"/>
If you're using MacOS X, CVS may give you messages about ".DS_Store" files. These
are used to keep track of window layouts, etc.  To suppress these messages,
just create a file in your home directory called ".cvsignore" and add a line 
of ".DS_Store" to it (no quotes). CVS will then ignore all .DS_Store files in 
all of your checked-out directory trees.

<h3>What is the convention for tag names?</h3>
<A id="tags"/>
Typically, three types of tag names are used:
<OL>
<LI>"Release-1-5-4" - the tag defining a specific released version of the code.
These are created during the release builds, and should not be changed.
<LI>"Release-1-5-4-branch" - this is the branch-tag defining a "patch branch"
for a specific release.  This is the only use we make of CVS branches; please
note that we do not use branches for normal development.
<LI>"rgj20050603a" - of the form "initials" "date" "some letter", these 
can be used by individual developers to keep track of what they're doing.  All
we ask is that you start a tag with your initials.
</OL>
