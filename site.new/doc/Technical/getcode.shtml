<h2>Quickstart</h2>

You can download the most recent source code via CVS using:
<PRE>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri login
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri co all 
</PRE>
(If asked for a password, just hit return)


<h2>Details</h2>
Our source code is distributed using CVS. 
(We also keep the 
<A href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a>
in CVS, if you'd like to work with it directly.)
If you want to work with the
code, a few minutes installing CVS is well worth it.  We're sorry, but
we just can't support other methods (sending .zip files, etc), as they're
just too error prone.

<P>
Many computers come with CVS installed, including Linux and MacOS X.
If you're using Windows, you will need to install a CVS "client" program like
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10072&release_id=24467">WinCVS</a>.
A recent version can be downloaded from: 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip</a>.

<P>
To get a copy of the source for your own use, you can use "anonymous checkout".
For a command line cvs client, make a new directory for the project,
change to it, and tell CVS you exist with
<PRE>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri login
</PRE>
This "login" line
is only needed once; after that, it is remembered on your local machine.  You may
be asked for a password. If so, just hit return, as the empty password will be accepted.
You can then get a copy of the code with
<PRE>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri co all
</PRE>
<P>
If you're using a GUI-based client like WinCVS, pull down the "admin"
menu and select "command line" to get a place to type these commands.
On other computers, you can type them directly on the command line.
<P>
See also the 
<A HREF="CVSFAQ.html">CVS FAQ page</a>.
<P>
After the checkout is complete, you'll find directories called
"xml", "resources", "jython", "help", "lib", "java" and others.
Change to the "java" directory.  There, you will find a "src"
directory that contains the source code for JMRI itself, and a "tests" 
directory that contains various test routines.
<P>
You can look at the code with your favorite text editor.  To compile and
run it, you need one of the compilation tools described on the bar at the
left: Ant, JBuilder, etc.  (Ant may be the easiest to install and use)
<P>
Once you're working with the code, you'll probably create some improvements
you'd like to contribute back to the project.  This is where CVS has tremendous
advantages; with the appropriate permissions and commands, you can merge your
changes back into the common source automagically.  Contact us when you're ready to
do that or see the <A HREF="index.html#contributing">info on contributing</a>.
