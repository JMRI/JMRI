<h1>Installing JMRI Scripting</h1>


Jython support became standard in JMRI starting with version 1.5.5. If you have
that version or a later one, you don't need to do anything to install scripting; it's
already present.

<P>
If you have a version earlier than 1.5.5, you might want to download
and install a newer version to use scripting, as this will bypass some problems
that older versions had.

<P>
If you really want to use scripting with an existing JMRI 1.4 to 1.5.4 version, you
have to install an extra file. 
<P>
To do this:
<OL>
<LI>Download the jython.jar file from 
<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/jython.jar?download">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/jython.jar?download</a>
<LI>Find your JMRI installation by searching for a file 
named "jmri.jar".  In that same directory, you should find
a "lib" directory containing a file named "log4j.jar".  Move
the jython.jar file into that "lib" directory.
</OL>

To test this, start DecoderPro or PanelPro, then
select "Script Output" from the Panels menu.
The first time you run this, you'll get a number of messages
about "processing modified jar"; these can be ignored, as they are normal.
If there are no other error messages, you should now be able to use
scripting.
