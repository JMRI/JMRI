<h3>What are Turnouts?</h3>

<p>JMRI calls just about any output to the layout a "Turnout".  
Originally, JMRI controlled just Turnouts via DCC accessory decoders.
As time went on, JMRI added more capability, but has kept that name.
Now, for example, the individual output pins on a C/MRI system
are also referenced via the "Turnout" name.
</p>

<h3>Controlling a Turnout</h3>

<p>
In most cases, you can just operate a turnout and JMRI will 
figure out why you mean.  
For example, you can open the "Turnout Control"
from the "Tools" menu, enter a Turnout number (DCC or C/MRI address number),
and click Thrown or Closed.  JMRI will take it from there.
</P>
<P>
The two states of the output are called "Closed" and "Thrown".  
"Closed" is the off, inactive, not commanded state.
"Thrown" is the on, active, commanded state. 
   
<h3>Saving Turnout configuration to disk</h3>

<p>The turnout definitions are saved in your layout configuration file, along with 
sensors, signal heads, etc.  To store this information on disk, use <b>Store 
Configuration...</b> in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Light 
Table (or other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b>
in the <b>Panel</b> menu. 

<A ID="add"><H3>Adding a new Turnout</H3></a>
<p>To fully configure a new Turnout, follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Click <b>Turnout Table</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu to bring up
the Turnout Table, and click the <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom of the 
table to bring up the Add/Edit Turnout window.</p>
	<li><p>Enter a system name, according to the JMRI convention. The first
letter designates your hardware system ('L' for loconet, 'C" for C/MRI,
etc.), and the second letter must be 'T' for Turnout. These are followed by
a number that gives the hardware address of the digital output bit being
referenced.  Examples of valid system addresses are: CT1004, and LT401, 
assuming you have the hardware for the addressed digital output bits.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Enter a user name. Any string of characters that is different 
from the user name of other Turnouts will be accepted, but it's 
wise to use a string that describes the intended use of the Turnout.
You can leave this blank if you'd like.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the window.  
If everything is fine, a message stating "New Turnout added ... " will be 
displayed in the notes area. If there is trouble with anything, an error or 
warning message will be displayed in the notes area; you should then
correct the error and click <b>Create</b> again.</p>
    </li>
    <LI><P>Back in the main Turnout Table, you can then select
options for the Turnout and control it by clicking on the state button.
</ol>
