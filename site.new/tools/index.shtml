		JMRI: General Tools
        </H2>

	<P>
	JMRI provides several tools that are optimized for 
	specific purposes. General tools:
	    <dl>

		<dt><h3><a href="Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a></h3></dt>
		<dd>
		    A Sensor is JMRI's way of representing an input from the layout.
		</dd>

		<dt><h3><a href="Turnouts.shtml">Turnouts</a></h3></dt>
		<dd>
		    JMRI calls just about any output to the layout a "Turnout". 
		</dd>

		<dt><h3><a href="throttle/ThrottleMain.html">Throttles</a></h3></dt>
		<dd>
		    You can open multiple software throttles to run
		    your DCC locomotives.
		</dd>

		<dt><h3><a href="ConsistTool/ConsistTool.html">Consisting</a></h3></dt>
		<dd>
		    JMRI provides tools for managing locomotive consists.
		</dd>

		<dt><h3><a href="Signals.shtml">Signals</a></h3></dt>
		<dd>
		    Signals (or more formally SignalHeads) are how JMRI represents
		    and controls signal heads on a layout. 
		    They are a specific kind of output device that can be set to various 
		    colors: Red, Yellow, Green, Flashing Yellow, etc.
		</dd>

		<dt><h3><a href="Lights.html">Lights</a></h3></dt>
		<dd>
		    Lights are digital output bits that function as on/off switches. 
		    Lights were created to provide easy control for fascia panel
		    lights and scenery lighting. 
		    Lights can also be used for any purpose that requires an 
		    on/off switch. A light can be used, for example, to activate 
		    an electromagnetic decoupler for a pre-determined time in 
		    response to a fascia panel button.
		</dd>

		<dt><h3><a href="Routes.html">Routes</a></h3></dt>
		<dd>
		    Routes are a tool for driving multiple turnouts when
		    something happens on the layout.  You can have a
		    panel switch through all the turnouts in your yard throat, 
		    etc. They can also change the status of Sensors, 
		    play sound files, and invoke scripts.  They
		    have some simple logic capabilities for deciding when
		    to set the route's outputs.
		</dd>

		<dt><h3><a href="Logix.html">Logix</a></h3></dt>
		<dd>
		    A Logix is a tool for entering powerful logical
		    expressions that can control parts of a layout.
		    Each one can monitor multiple inputs and logical
		    operations through containing a number of Conditional
		    expressions, each of which can take simple actions.
		    For more powerful control, combine the logical
		    reasoning of a Logix with the powerful output
		    controls of a Route.
		</dd>

        <dt><h3><a href="fastclock">Fast Clocks</a></h3></dt>
        <DD>
            JMRI can both provide various types of fast clocks
            on the computer screen, and also work with the
            fast clocks already installed on your layout.
        </dd>

   		<dt><h3><a href="../apps/Speedometer/index.html">Speedometer</a></h3></dt>
		<dd>
		    A tool for determining the scale speed of your
		    locomotives.  You can use this while setting them up,
		    to catch speeders, or for whatever you'd like.
		</dd>


	<h2><a href="../apps/LocoTools/index.html">LocoNet-specific Tools</a></h2>
	A set of Digitrax LocoNet-specific tools:
		    <UL>
		    <LI><dfn>LocoNet monitor</dfn>
		    <LI><dfn>Slot monitor</dfn>
		    <LI><dfn>Packet source</dfn>
		    <LI><dfn>PM4 programmer</dfn>
		    <LI><dfn>BDL16 programmer</dfn>
		    <LI><dfn>SE8C programmer</dfn>
		    <LI><dfn>LocoIO programmer</dfn>
		    </UL>

   	<h2><a href="../doc/scripts/index.html">Scripting</a></h2>
    If there isn't a preprogrammed tool to do what you want,
    you can almost certainly write a script that does exactly what's needed.
    <P>
    Instead of defining our own language, 
    <A HREF="../doc/scripts/index.html">JMRI scripting</a>
    uses the
    "Python" language that's commonly used in web development.  Although it
    will take you a little time to get used to it, in the end it provides
    a lot of power to control your layout anyway you'd like.
