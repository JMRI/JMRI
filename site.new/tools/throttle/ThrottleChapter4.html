		<P>A new throttle window can be started and a DCC address established
		to run a train around a layout, and then close down the throttle
		window when done with it.  This of course loses the configuration
		that you established during this throttle session.  And this is fine
		if you are running a test of sorts on a loco that
		you have no intention of running by one of these computer throttles.
		Therefore, closing down the throttle window to eliminate it would
		suffice.</P>

					<A HREF="ThrottleChapter2.html">previous chapters</A>
					with building up a new throttle layout and got your train
					moving, then the next question that probably comes to
					your mind is, "how do I save it?"</P>
							
					<P>Following the directions provided in

		<B>Note:</B> &nbsp; Because the JMRI Throttles are still in their "beta" development mode, there are still some

		(i.e. Digitrax) are reacting differently when this occurs.<BR><BR>  

		<B>Enhancement requests</B>
		are already on the list for the throttles to be "smart" in determining when another
		throttle already has the address.  But until these throttles are fully implemented, just
		beware that there may be quirks with your particular DCC system with this
		feature.  It is therefore suggested that <U>prior</U> to opening up a saved
		throttle layout file, the DCC address is verified as not being used

					<STRONG>TIP!</STRONG>
					</CENTER>
								
					<P>When creating throttle layout files, you can save the same decoder address
					in multiple throttle layout files.  A good example of why you may want to do this 
					would be if you create several throttle layout files,
					each consisting of a single throttle window controlling one single locomotive —
					like one for each loco in your roster.  There may
					be times when you wish to just run a single locomotive and you just open up the associated layout file.  
					Simple!  But what if you find yourself opening up the same locomotive throttles consistently on each session.
					It's going to become a pain opening up (and "merging") these throttles one at a time.  
					Therefore, you could create another layout file that contains all of the throttle windows 
					that you wish; then just open up the one layout file and you'll
					have all of the throttle windows defined.</P>
								
					<P>Just remember, when making a change to the configuration
					of a throttle window, it only gets changed in the layout file that you saved — it is <U>not</U>
					a global change in every file where that locomotive is used.</P>

		<H1>Closing a Throttle Window</H1>

		<P>When done with a throttle window, it might be a good idea if you get into the practice
		of either "releasing" or "dispatching" the locomotive before completely closing down
		the throttle window.</P>
				
		<P>If you have made any configuration changes to the throttle window, and you want to save them,
		you'll need to follow the steps as outlined above.</P>
				
		<P class="important">
		<B>Note:</B> &nbsp; If you "save" any changes that you have made during a session back to an existing throttle
		layout file, beware that <U>ALL</U> currently opened throttle windows will also be saved to
		the same file.
		</P>

		<P>When you are ready, simply close down the throttle window as you normally would on whatever
		computer system you use.  For example, for Microsoft Windows, simply click on the "<BIG>X</BIG>"
		in the upper right corner of the throttle window.</P>
