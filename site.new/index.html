		<h1>What is JMRI?</h1>

		<p> The JMRI project is building tools for model railroad computer control. We
		    want it to be usable to as many people as possible, so we're building it in
		    Java to run anywhere, and we're trying to make it independent of specific
		    hardware systems.</p>
		<p> JMRI is intended as a jumping-off point for
		    hobbyists who want to control their layouts from a computer without having
		    to create an entire system from scratch.</p>
		<p> You can manage your locomotive rosters and easily program your decoders using
		    <a href="./help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/index.shtml">DecoderPro</a>.
		    You can build control panels, set up signaling, configure operations and control
		    your layout using
		    <a href="./help/en/html/apps/PanelPro/PanelPro.shtml">PanelPro</a>.
		    Going beyond the basics, you can use <a href="./help/en/html/tools/Logix.shtml">Logix</a> to
		    automate your layout's behavior, interface with X10 and Insteon systems to control your 
		    layout room's <a href="./help/en/html/tools/Lights.shtml">lights</a> 		    
		    and write 
		    <a href="./help/en/html/tools/scripting/index.shtml">scripts</a> to extend the capabilities 
		    of the system.</p>

            As an open source project, JMRI is evolving in many directions at once.  You can get

            JMRI is an informal open-source software group. 
            We do this for the joy of model railroading, and don't produce anything for profit. 
            <p>
            One of our members has spent the past four years in the Federal Courts
            <a href="/k/summary.shtml">defending our right to continue</a> 
            against an individual who has attacked us with
            bogus patent threats, cybersquatting, copyright infringement and other illegal acts.

            The agreement ends the dispute, and gives everybody involved a way to move forward.

			The best way to learn about JMRI is often from somebody in your own 
            area.  There's a lot about it that's just easier to demonstrate than 
            to describe over email.  JMRI users (and model railroaders in 
            general) tend to be helpful, interesting people, and are often 
            amazingly helpful. But how to find somebody local?  
            <p>
            We've set up a 
            <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/app/peoplemap/view/map">"JMRI Users" web site</a> 
			that lets JMRI users mark where they're located
            so others can get in touch.
            People can add themselves to it pretty easily.  If enough people do 
            that, it'll be a useful tool when looking for somebody in your local 
            area.
