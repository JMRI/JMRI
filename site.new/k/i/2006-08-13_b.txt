On August 11, 2006, the Court held a hearing to decide
the motions.
(<a href="/k/docket/141.pdf">Transcript</a>)
The day before, the Court had issued a 
<A href="/k/docket/85.pdf">tentative ruling<a/>
that indicated the questions that were to be addressed in the 
hearing, and said that the Court was tentatively planning
to grant all the motions (basically giving Katzer, KAM
and Russell all that they had requested).

<P>
The hearing lasted about 90 minutes, during which the 
Judge asked thoughtful questions of both sides.  Clearly, he
was trying to understand the issues raised in the large
legal briefs.  In the end, however, he
adopted the tentative order, and 
issued a 
<A href="/k/docket/86.pdf">"minute order"</a>
to that effect.  

<P>
We don't have the Court's full reasoning, but we believe that - 
because of California's anti-SLAPP procedure - 
the Court decided it could not hear evidence that would 
contradict Katzer's false statements. 
As a result, Katzer prevailed.   
And as a result, California's anti-SLAPP law requires that the
defendants (Katzer and Russell) be reimbursed for their legal fees.  
The next step is the Court ruling on 
Katzer and Russell's 
<A href="/k/docket/index.shtml#fees1">attorneys fee requests</a>.
We have filed objections with the Court, and 
demand more detail of the bills than the sketchy 
outlines that have been provided so far. 
But if the requests are found to be reasonable, the Court will then order them paid. 

<P>
The important thing is that the main parts of the case are still 
intact.  However, certain claims in
the original complaint have been removed. The 
Court will no longer consider libel or anti-trust 
charges against Katzer, nor any charges against 
Russell.
