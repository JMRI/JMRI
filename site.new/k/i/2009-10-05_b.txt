The discovery process in the main case is drawing to a close.
<p>
Both sides have provided the other with huge numbers of 
documents, answered questions, and desposed witnesses.
The process is exhausting, because we've been asked for all
sorts of things (have you ever had to feed a file cabinet to a scanner? Don't,
if you can possibly avoid it), and because we've had to go through
piles of documents provided by the other side.

<p>
The information from discovery has to remain confidential until it's 
needed to prove facts for the Court, and even then Katzer can ask 
that some things be sealed.

<p>
What we can say is that we've been able to get what we needed to prove our case.
Some of that will become visible at the next step, 
which is the filing of Summary Judgment
motions at the end of the month.
