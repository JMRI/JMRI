In June 2006, we learned that Katzer took JMRI copyrighted code, 
stripped out authors' names and JMRI copyright notices, 
converted it to his own use and then distributed it as his own.

<P>
DecoderPro is able to easily configure more than 300
types of devices because hobbyists have contributed more
than 100 
<A HREF="http://jmri.org/apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoder.html">decoder definition files</a>.  
These definitions, produced by lots of separate
<a href="/help/en/Acknowledgements.shtml">contributors</a>,
are what makes the program so useful, 
since they express a model railroader's view of how best to configure
a particular device.  DecoderPro first started using this approach
in September of 2001.

In 2004, Matt Katzer started talking about "his" Decoder Commander
product.  It was finally released in 2005; on his web site, 
Katzer used to claim:
<blockquote>
In June 2005 at the [NMRA] Cincinnati convention we Introduced Decoder Commander. 
The first XML based distributed programmer.(sic)
</blockquote>
(Untrue, as JMRI predated this by years)
Imagine our surprise when we discovered
that he had copied the JMRI decoder definitions
for distribution on his CDs and even tried to 
claim them as his own work, saying
in the product manual
<blockquote>
All decoders have unique characteristics. 
KAM has created a set of Decoder Templates 
that has these characteristics in an XML configuration file.
</blockquote>
A 
<a href="/k/copycomparison.html">separate page</a>
discusses some of the evidence for the copying in detail, but we can 
summarize some key points:
<UL>
<LI>He distributed a copy of each of the JMRI files.
For example, the content of the JMRI QSI_Electric.xml 
file was included on
the Decoder Commander CD in a file called QSI_Electric.tpl.xml; the names
are identical except for adding the ".tpl" modifier. 
All of the files on the KAM version 304 CD were based on JMRI files
in this way; no extra
files were present on the KAM version 304 CD.
<LI>Original JMRI definition files contain the version, the date modified, 
the author's name, and a copyright notice.  
These have
free-form content, so there are many formats.  The version
strings and the modification date strings in the KAM files are
EXACTLY the same as those in the original JMRI files they were
copied from.  The author's name, however, was not copied into
the KAM file, nor was the JMRI copyright information.
<LI>Many details of the content of the original JMRI files were
copied exactly:  Misspellings, odd capitalizations, technical errors, 
even the order in which options are described were all copied over
exactly.
</UL>
KAM created a tool that copies JMRI definitions and 
stores them in the KAM format, 
deliberately omitting all evidence of
their origin with DecoderPro. 
Katzer even advertises this
tool as a feature of "his" product, without even mentioning 
that they're the work of JMRI.
