    <h2>JMRI Defense: Our Story So Far</h2>
 
 <!-- the content goes here -->
 
This page describes our efforts to protect our Open Source project from 
attacks by a patent holder.  
He makes arguments in federal court to justify his actions, 
and if he prevails, 
he will strike right at the heart of the Open Source community.  
We are one of the first projects to have to defend against bogus 
patent claims and protect its copyrighted software and license.  
We certainly won't be the last. 
Here's our story. 
 
<h4><A ID="intro"/>Introduction</h4>
<A HREF="/index.html">JMRI</a>
is open-source software for model-railroaders.  There's a
<a href="/index.html">separate page</a>
that describes the history of the project, and gives further links.
"<a href="/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/index.shtml">DecoderPro&reg;</a>" 
and 
"<a href="/help/en/html/apps/PanelPro/PanelPro.shtml">PanelPro&trade;</a>"
are built on JMRI, and are popular tools for programming locomotives
and operating layouts.
DecoderPro has been around for several years.
<P>
Matt Katzer owns 
<a HREF="http://kamind.com">KAM Industries</a>, 
a company that tries to sell
model railroad software.  He's never 
<a href="/help/en/Acknowledgements.shtml">contributed</a>
anything to the JMRI effort.
But that hasn't stopped him from taking JMRI intellectual 
property.

<P>
Matt Katzer and his company
<A HREF="http://kamind.net/">KAMIND Associates, Inc. <A/>
are attacking the 
rights of open source groups to enforce their copyrights and licenses.  
If they prevail, the rights of open source groups like JMRI will 
be significantly weakened, if not lost.  We are breaking ground for 
open source groups in federal court and establishing legal rights for 
open source groups and their members.  
We need your help and donations to succeed in this legal fight.
<P>
In the next sections we discuss Katzer's cybersquatting, 
enforcement of bogus patents, 
copyright infringement and 
our fight in federal court.

<A ID="decoderpro.com.1"/>
<h4>Cybersquatting and the decoderpro.com domain name</h4>
In October of 2004, 
we noticed that Katzer had registered
decoderpro.com as a domain name in February of 2004.  
When asked about it, 
Katzer said he was considering whether he would
<q>
be able to take the open source
code  and turn it into a licensed product so it could be distributed
</q>.
Katzer also said he had the name because
<blockquote>
If I decide that to released (sic) a licensed version of an open source
development effort, what better place to have it then the name of the
development effort?
</blockquote>
<P>
We registered the DecoderPro&reg; name as a federal trademark.  
This was expensive, so we sought 
<A href="donations.shtml">donations</a> 
through our JMRI web site on SourceForge.
Bob Jacobsen, one of the JMRI developers and the person
who maintains the JMRI web site,
<A href="correspondence/20041108-RGJ.pdf">wrote to Matt Katzer</a> asking for the return of
the domain name, but never received a reply.
Jerry Britton, a JMRI user, offered to trade another domain name for it. 
Instead, 
<A HREF="Britton/3-04-cv-01627-JE-doc-1.pdf">Matt Katzer sued him</a>.
That suit was eventually 
<A HREF="Britton/3-04-cv-01627-JE-doc-4.pdf">settled</a>
by having them swap
domains, so that Jerry ended up with decoderpro.com
-- and a lot of restrictions that Katzer imposed on him. 
For one, Jerry couldn't transfer decoderpro.com to anyone else, 
including JMRI. 
If he did, Jerry would have to pay $20,000 plus attorney's fees.
(Note that Katzer did not impose similar transfer restrictions on 
himself for the domain name he got out of the deal.)
Katzer also demanded
that Jerry not talk about this agreement, on pain of 
a $20,000 penalty.
We learned of this settlement from public records in
the Oregon federal court, because Katzer's attorney 
Kevin Russell didn't file the agreement under seal as he was supposed to.

<h4>Bogus Patents</h4>

Beginning in 1998, Katzer applied for multiple
patents on technology developed by other people.
The US Patent Office granted
them, in part because Katzer failed to tell the patent 
examiner what he knew about existing products
and inventors. 

<P>
Katzer filed his 
<A HREF="http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6065406.PN.&OS=PN/6065406&RS=PN/6065406">first patent application</a>
on June 24, 1998. 
Although well aware of other's work,
Katzer intentionally did not tell the Patent Office that
the "invention" he was claiming had already been 
done by, among others,
<UL>
<LI>Juergen Freiwald's TrainController (Railroad&Co)
<LI>John Kabat's LocoNet VxD
<LI>Hans-Rudi Tanner's WinLok (although he did mention DigiToys, Hans-Rudi's company, 
Katzer didn't tell the examiner the name of WinLok or produce it 
for the examiner)
<LI>Strad Bushby's model railroad, using Digitrax LocoNet to connect multiple
computers
</UL>
and others.
There's no doubt that Katzer knew of these.
Katzer described them in his talk at the
<A HREF="docket/46-47.pdf">1997</a> NMRA convention, and in his
<A HREF="docket/46-33.pdf">1st</a>,
<A HREF="docket/46-37.pdf">2nd</a> and
<A HREF="docket/46-38.pdf">3rd</a>
talks at the 1998 convention.
If he had produced this information to the patent examiner, 
as he was required to do by law, 
these patents would never have been
granted, and everybody would have been saved a lot of trouble.

<P>
After the first patents were granted, Katzer filed a
<A HREF="docket/46-31.pdf">lawsuit</a>
against Hans-Rudi Tanner and another 
<A HREF="docket/46-34.pdf">suit</a>
against Juergen Freiwald for patent
infringement, and sent 
<A HREF="docket/47-5.pdf">cease and desist letters</a>
to many of their of dealers. 
Juergen and Hans-Rudi both 
<A HREF="docket/47-6.pdf">wrote</a> 
Katzer in October 2002, 
explaining that
lots of "prior art" existed to demonstrate that Katzer's
patent was invalid, and that since Katzer knew about those
pre-existing programs, he'd violated 
his duty to tell the patent examiner the information
when he filed
his patent application.
Shortly thereafter, Katzer 
<A HREF="docket/46-32.pdf">dropped</a>
the suits.

<P>
Katzer didn't shy away from using his patents to push hobbyists around.
On September 8, 2004, Glenn Butcher wrote to the
loconet_info mailing list:
<blockquote>
Mr Kratzer(sic) and I have had a short exchange of emails on the topic of his 
patents.  As a result, I have chosen to remove my loconetd and railroadd 
servers and client apps from my website.   Mr Kratzer(sic) forwarded a FAQ on 
his technology licensing that contained a list of questions to aid in 
determining whether others' efforts could be infringing on his patents; 
some are specific but in my opinion others appear to be general enough 
to cover most of the software development activity discussed on this 
list.  As I don't have the resources to consult a patent attorney in 
this matter, I've taken a conservative approach to protecting myself.
<br>
I find it disappointing to have to do this, especially to protect the 
rights to exclusively use what, in my opinion, appear to be simple 
extensions of what I used to teach in undergraduate computer science.  
However, I don't think it's worth fighting when that time could be spent 
building my layout, money could be spent on the brass D&RGW K-37 I so 
dearly covet...
</blockquote>

<P>
This also resulted in a large amount of criticism of Katzer's
actions, with a number of people announcing that they would no longer 
consider his products.
(As we 
<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/message/17824">have stated before</a>, 
we are dead set against any 
harassment or boycotting actions, 
and believe that model railroaders should be able to buy whatever products they want.)

<P>
Meanwhile, in March and April 2002, JMRI developers were working
on "client/server" capabilities for LocoNet.  
Client/server communications for model or 
prototype railroads are not novel; there are 
lots of examples available, dating back for 
years. 
The client/server capability
was a straightforward implementation using Sun Microsystem's
Java RMI software tools (the similarity to the JMRI acronym is coincidental, 
though confusing). 
Using these,
a remote computer running a JMRI product (e.g. DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc)
could operate the layout by connecting to a local server computer
that was directly connected to the layout.  
People discussed this update in March 2002 on a public email list while 
it was being developed.  
On April 14, 2002,
the client/server update was announced as part of a JMRI test release. 
As always, the source code was available 
to the public on the web.
<P>
Three days later, on April 17, 2002, Katzer
fired off a 
<A HREF="http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6530329.PN.&OS=PN/6530329&RS=PN/6530329">patent application</a>
intended to cover this, and claimed a filing
date of June 1998.
He could do this --
US patent law allows for "continuation applications".
If you have a pending application, you can file another one
that "gains the benefit" of the earlier application.  From a legal
perspective, Katzer could make his applications look as if
he'd invented the JMRI capability in 1998!

<P>
By misleading
the Patent Office, 
Katzer was able to obtain a patent on this capability
by the start of 2003.  
Specifically, he has a patent on any system that uses
<blockquote>
1. A method of operating a digitally controlled model railroad comprising the steps of: 
<BR>
(a) transmitting a first command from a first program to an interface; 
<BR>
(b) transmitting a second command from a second program to said interface; and 
<BR>
(c) sending third and fourth commands from said interface representative of said first and second commands, respectively, to a digital command station. 
</blockquote>
<br/>
(Claim 1 of US patent 
<A HREF="http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6530329.PN.&OS=PN/6530329&RS=PN/6530329">6,530,329</a>,
aka "the '329 patent")


<h4>Enforcing Patents Against JMRI and Bob Jacobsen</h4>

After the '329 patent issued, 
Katzer and Russell sent letters
that 
<A HREF="correspondence/20050308-KAM.pdf">demanded $19</a>, 
and later 
<A HREF="correspondence/20050824-KAM.pdf">$29 in royalties</a>
per downloaded copy of JMRI.
We believe that the patent was invalid because of prior art, 
and if they had provided the prior art in their possession to the
patent examiner in the first place, the patent would never have been granted.
It didn't stop them.  
Bob Jacobsen received 
<A HREF="correspondence/20050824-KAM-A.pdf">bills for in excess of $200,000</a> 
on a roughly monthly basis from August 2005 to January 2006.
(There's a separate 
<A HREF="correspondence/index.html">correspondence page</a>
that has the all the letters)
<P>
When that harassment 
wasn't enough to stop JMRI, 
Katzer and Russell 
contacted Bob's employer 
in an attempt to intimidate him.  
Bob is a physics professor who works part time
for the University of California at Berkeley, and
part time at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL, 
run by the US Department of Energy). 
<A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov">LBL<a/>
is run by a Nobel-prize-winning
physicist, and has thousands of scientists doing basic and applied forefront 
research.
Russell sent a 
<A HREF="correspondence/FOIA-20051027.pdf">Freedom of Information Act request</a>
to LBL, asserting that the Laboratory
"had duties for the JMRI project", and that 
KAM's patents were "being infringed by the JMRI project sponsored
by the LAB". The request went on to ask for Bob's private emails, along with
a number of other types of information designed to embarrass Bob
in front of his employer.
<P>
The Department of Energy eventually decided that the request was 
<A HREF="misc/FOIA1.pdf">without merit</a>, 
but only after it had caused a lot of trouble.

<P>
In the meantime, 
<A HREF="correspondence/20060105-KAM-1.pdf">Russell continued to send</a>
fraudulent
<A HREF="correspondence/20060105-KAM-3.pdf">invoices for more than $200,000</a>.

<A ID="2006-03-13">
<h4>Jacobsen asks for a Declaratory Judgment</h4>

In March 2006, we couldn't allow this to go on, and filed a 
<A HREF="docket/1.pdf">"Declaratory Judgment"</A> 
action
in Federal Court to get a legal determination
on our rights.
<P>
The complaint lists acts of unfair competition, 
libel, patent fraud and misrepresentation, etc, and
asks that the Court issue injunctions to prevent
Russell and Katzer from continuing them.

<A ID="2006-07-12">
<h4>Anti-SLAPP motions</h4>

In mid-May 2006, Katzer and Russell filed several motions
to dismiss parts of the complaint. In particular, 
Katzer filed a motion to 
<A HREF="docket/29.pdf">dismiss the libel claims</a> 
under the California anti-SLAPP law, and Russell
filed motions to 
dismiss claims 
<A HREF="docket/23.pdf">under the anti-SLAPP law</a>
and 
<A HREF="docket/18.pdf">for the procedural reasons</a>
of lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.

<P>
The California anti-SLAPP law is intended to protect people 
who make comments about 
issues of public interest, or as part of official government proceedings.
It was not originally intended to protect corporate wrong-doers, though 
it's being used that way more and more. It's particularly dangerous for JMRI,
because it automatically requires that, if a suit is struck down due to the
anti-SLAPP law, the defendants (in this case Matt Katzer, KAM and/or Kevin Russell) get
their legal costs reimbursed by the plaintiff (Bob Jacobsen).

<P>
In their 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#k-anti-slapp">motions and associated declarations</a>,
they make some pretty unbelievable claims.  For example, Katzer in his 
<a href="docket/13.pdf">declaration</a>
refers to the Department of Energy's "apparent sponsorship of the java
model railroad interface (sic) (JMRI) project".  
He then argues
that his "reasonable" belief was based on:
<UL>
<LI>Two papers (which he misrepresents) where 
the National Science Foundation (not the Department of Energy or LBL)
has provided money for a college to use model trains in teaching real-time programming
and communications.

<LI>"Notice of the formation of JMRI on DOE or other official 
letterhead" that he said he "believed" he saw on the JMRIusers discussion 
group in January or February 2004. 
Setting aside that JMRI had existed for years before the date he 
here claimed it was "formed", 
both Yahoo and Internet Archive show no indication of such "notice" ever existed.
The statement is a complete fabrication.

<LI>Bob Jacobsen's emails and posting which Katzer misrepresented
as "documents promoting JMRI",
"including a request for funding".

</UL>
Katzer then claims that:
<blockquote>
"It was not the purpose of the FOIA request to embarrass Jacobsen with his employer,
as alleged in the complaint. At the time of sending the FOIA request, I had no
knowledge of Jacobsen's employment status, either with the DOE or any other 
employer. At the time of sending the FOIA request, I assumed that Jacobsen 
worked for the University of California at Berkeley based on a representation
Jacobsen made to a model train internet newsgroup in 2001."
</blockquote>
Note that the third sentence contradicts the second in that paragraph.
It's simply unbelievable that Katzer didn't think
Bob worked for LBL, given that Katzer was already aware of Bob's use of an
LBL email address.  They had even had several direct email exchanges in the past.

<P>
Still, given the structure of the California anti-SLAPP law
and that Katzer is willing to lie to the court, 
it's going to take a very large amount of effort to defeat these motions.
We'll be submitting replies, which will be available from 
the 
<A href="docket/index.shtml#k-anti-slapp">documents page</a>
once they're in.

<A ID="2006-08-13">
<h4>Court Hearing</h4>
On August 11, 2006, the Court held a hearing to decide
the motions.
(<a href="docket/141.pdf">Transcript</a>)
The day before, the Court had issued a 
<A HREF="docket/85.pdf">tentative ruling<a/>
that indicated the questions that were to be addressed in the 
hearing, and said that the Court was tentatively planning
to grant all the motions (basically giving Katzer, KAM
and Russell all that they had requested).

<P>
The hearing lasted about 90 minutes, during which the 
Judge asked thoughtful questions of both sides.  Clearly, he
was trying to understand the issues raised in the large
legal briefs.  In the end, however, he
adopted the tentative order, and 
issued a 
<A HREF="docket/86.pdf">"minute order"</a>
to that effect.  

<P>
We don't have the Court's full reasoning, but we believe that - 
because of California's anti-SLAPP procedure - 
the Court decided it could not hear evidence that would 
contradict Katzer's false statements. 
As a result, Katzer prevailed.   
And as a result, California's anti-SLAPP law requires that the
defendants (Katzer and Russell) be reimbursed for their legal fees.  
The next step is the Court ruling on 
Katzer and Russell's 
<A HREF="docket/index.shtml#fees1">attorneys fee requests</a>.
We have filed objections with the Court, and 
demand more detail of the bills than the sketchy 
outlines that have been provided so far. 
But if the requests are found to be reasonable, the Court will then order them paid. 

<P>
The important thing is that the main parts of the case are still 
intact.  However, certain claims in
the original complaint have been removed. The 
Court will no longer consider libel or anti-trust 
charges against Katzer, nor any charges against 
Russell.


<A ID="2006-09-10">
<h4>Infringing Copyrighted Material</h4>

Katzer took JMRI copyrighted code, 
stripped out authors' names and JMRI copyright notices, 
converted it to his own use and then distributed it as his own.

<P>
DecoderPro is able to easily configure more than 300
types of devices because hobbyists have contributed more
than 100 
<A HREF="../apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoder.html">decoder definition files</a>.  
These definitions, produced by lots of separate
<a href="/help/en/Acknowledgements.shtml">contributors</a>,
are what makes the program so useful, 
since they express a model railroader's view of how best to configure
a particular device.  DecoderPro first started using this approach
in September of 2001.
<P>
In 2004, Matt Katzer started talking about "his" Decoder Commander
product.  It was finally released in 2005; on his web site, 
Katzer used to claim:
<blockquote>
In June 2005 at the [NMRA] Cincinnati convention we Introduced Decoder Commander. 
The first XML based distributed programmer.(sic)
</blockquote>
(Untrue, as JMRI predated this by years)
Imagine our surprise when we discovered
that he had copied the JMRI decoder definitions
for distribution on his CDs and even tried to 
claim them as his own work, saying
in the product manual
<blockquote>
All decoders have unique characteristics. 
KAM has created a set of Decoder Templates 
that has these characteristics in an XML configuration file.
</blockquote>
A 
<a href="copycomparison.html">separate page</a>
discusses some of the evidence for the copying in detail, but we can 
summarize some key points:
<UL>
<LI>He distributed a copy of each of the JMRI files.
For example, the content of the JMRI QSI_Electric.xml 
file was included on
the Decoder Commander CD in a file called QSI_Electric.tpl.xml; the names
are identical except for adding the ".tpl" modifier. 
All of the files on the KAM version 304 CD were based on JMRI files
in this way; no extra
files were present on the KAM version 304 CD.
<LI>Original JMRI definition files contain the version, the date modified, 
the author's name, and a copyright notice.  
These have
free-form content, so there are many formats.  The version
strings and the modification date strings in the KAM files are
EXACTLY the same as those in the original JMRI files they were
copied from.  The author's name, however, was not copied into
the KAM file, nor was the JMRI copyright information.
<LI>Many details of the content of the original JMRI files were
copied exactly:  Misspellings, odd capitalizations, technical errors, 
even the order in which options are described were all copied over
exactly.
</UL>
KAM created a tool that copies JMRI definitions and 
stores them in the KAM format, 
deliberately omitting all evidence of
their origin with DecoderPro. 
Katzer even advertises this
tool as a feature of "his" product, without even mentioning 
that they're the work of JMRI.

<A ID="2006-09-11">
<h4>Amended Complaint</h4>

On September 11, 2006, we filed an
"<A HREF="docket/96.pdf">Amended Complaint</a>"
with the Court.  
This includes descriptions of Katzer's and KAM's copyright
and trademark violations (discussed 
<a href="#2006-09-10">above</a>) 
and asks the Court for relief.

<A ID="2006-09-27"/>
<h4>Another Round of Motions from Katzer</h4>
September 27, 2006: 
Katzer's lawyer has filed another 
<A HREF="docket/100.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> 
parts of the amended complaint.
<P>
In it, he doesn't argue that Katzer didn't copy the JMRI software
in violation of the copyright terms, probably because even HE can't stretch
the truth that far. Instead, he argues that copyright doesn't protect
free and open source (FOSS) software!  You can read the entire argument
in the 
<A HREF="docket/100.pdf">motion filed with the court</a>,
in particular the section named
"Plaintiff has waived his ability to sue under the Copyright Act"
starting on page 13.
Basically, it says that since JMRI makes the software available on the web, 
free of charge (although not free of restriction), 
when someone like Katzer takes it and uses it in violation of 
those restrictions, we can sue him in contract law only, if at all.
The shocking part of Katzer's argument is that he says we have no rights under 
either copyright or contract to enforce.
<P>
This argument strikes right at the heart of much of FOSS licensing.  
It's already hard enough for the FOSS community to enforce its legal rights.
If we lose the possibility of protecting the integrity of our work via copyrights,
we'll be in a terrible situation.
We hope you'll help us in this fight.

<h4>Written Ruling on Initial Motions</h4>

On October 20th, 2006, the Court issued its
<A HREF="docket/111.pdf">written order</a>
on the initial motions.  
The decision was along the lines of the 
<A HREF="docket/86.pdf">minute order</a>
issued right after the hearing
and 
<A HREF="#2006-08-13">discussed previously</a>.
The Court did find that the full amount of the legal 
fees demanded by Jerger and Zeff was "excessive" and "unreasonable", 
so it reduced the amounts
to $14,486.68 and $16,976.25 respectively.

<A ID="2006-10-25"/>
<h4>Request for Preliminary Injunction Against Copyright Infringement</h4>
October 25, 2006:
Given the strength of the evidence that Katzer copied from
JMRI, and given that it appears that he's going to continue,
we asked the court for a preliminary injunction. The
<A HREF="docket/114.pdf">motion</a>
was accompanied by 
<A HREF="docket/index.shtml#114">two declarations and several exhibits</a>.
This was scheduled for a hearing on January 19, 2007.

<A ID="2006-10-30"/>
<h4>Request for Reconsideration of Motions Denied</h4>
On October 30, 2006, we filed a 
"<A HREF="docket/120.pdf">Motion for Leave to File</a> Motion for Reconsideration, Motion for Stay, and Request for Clarification".
This was a preliminary step required before seeking reconsideration of the 
written order of October 20th, 2006.
It lays out the reasons why we think that reconsideration is justified.
The Court 
<A HREF="docket/121.pdf">denied the request</a>
that same day. 
As a result, 
Bob paid the 
<A HREF="#2006-10-20">legal fees demanded</a> by Jerger and Zeff.
David Zeff wasn't content
to actually wait for the deadline, however, and sent another
<a href="docket/122.pdf">threatening email</a> (see page 15 in the linked filing).

<A ID="2006-11-03"/>

<h4>Reply to Motions; Defending Open-Source Copyright</h4>
On November 3, 2006, we filed an
<A HREF="docket/123.pdf">opposition</a>
(basically, a rebuttal argument)
to Katzer's
<A HREF="#2006-10-03">motion of September 28th</a>
in which he argues that copyright law shouldn't apply to his
theft of the JMRI files.
There are various technical elements involved, but the
most important parts are the sections defending
the use of copyright for protecting open-source software (pages 3 through 10).
The next steps were a reply from Katzer, due on November 17th, 
then a decision from the Court. We will probably have a tentative
ruling the day before the hearing (currently scheduled for January 19th, 2007), followed 
by the final ruling.

<A ID="2006-12-04"/>
<h4>Activity on Motions and Copyright</h4>

On November 9th, Katzer filed his 
<A HREF="docket/124.pdf">Memorandum in Opposition</a>
to our motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent further violations of
the copyright in the JMRI decoder definition files.
Included with it was a 
<a HREF="docket/124-1.pdf">declaration by Matt Katzer</a>.
He argues that he shouldn't be held responsible for the actions of
KAM Industries, his company, and repeated the previous arguments
that copyright law doesn't apply.
Katzer also argued that he had stopped distributing any products with JMRI materials, 
and thus the Court should not order him to stop infringing.
<P>
Not that it matters - once someone breaks the law and has shown that he will continue to, 
he can't get out of an injunction just by saying that he stopped breaking the law. 
Nevertheless, we tried to confirm whether Katzer was telling the truth, 
but his product wouldn't work 
and so we couldn't tell if he had stopped using JMRI copyrighted materials.
<P>
On November 17th, we filed a 
<A HREF="docket/129.pdf">reply</a> to this, along with declarations from
<A HREF="docket/130.pdf">Paul Bender</a>,
<A HREF="docket/131.pdf">Bob Jacobsen</a> (<A HREF="docket/index.shtml#131">exhibits</a>) and
<A HREF="docket/132.pdf">Alex Shepherd</a> (<A HREF="docket/index.shtml#132">exhibits</a>),
to set the record straight.
<P>
Also on November 17th, Katzer filed his
<a href="docket/127/pdf">reply</a>
to our memorandum opposing his motions to dismiss.
He backed off his challenge to our copyright right claim - at least for the time being.
<P>
On December 4th, we filed a
<a href="docket/137.pdf">Motion for Leave to File Surreply to Defendant's Reply Memorandum</a>.

This is the legal mechanism to ask the Court to file a response to a Reply brief. 
Normally, once the Reply has been filed, the parties can't file anything else. 
However, under certain circumstances, the Court will consider a 'Surreply'.  
We believe that because Katzer misstated case law and brought up new facts 
that we should be permitted to respond to those, 
which is why we sought 'leave' (that is, permission) to file the Surreply 
and then attached the 
<a href="docket/137.pdf">Surreply</a>.
The Court will first decide whether to consider it, and if
so, then take it into account.


<A ID="2007-01-19"/>

<h4>January 19th Hearing</h4>
We had a hearing before the Judge on January 19th, 2007.
(<a href="docket/172.pdf">Transcript</a>)
Two sets of issues were addressed:
<UL>
<LI>Katzer's 
<A HREF="docket/index.shtml#motions2">motions</a> re the
Amended Complaint
to dismiss for failure 
to state a claim on which relief can be granted, 
motion to dismiss for failure to join a necessary 
party, motion to strike, and motion for a more definite statement.
<LI>Bob Jacobsen's 
<A HREF="docket/index.shtml#preliminjunction1">motion for preliminary injunction</a>
to prevent further copyright violations
</UL>
The day before, the Court provided a 
<A HREF="docket/147.pdf">Notice of Tentative Ruling and Questions</a>,
which provides some background for what was going to happen.
<P>
The Judge quizzed both sides about the <A HREF="docket/147.pdf">questions</a> he'd previously provided. 
He then took the case under submission, which means he'll give his decision in a written ruling
at a later date. 
<P>
After that, there was a discussion of the scheduling of the next steps in the case, called a Case Management Conference. 
If you're interested in those details, there's some additional information in the 
<A href="docket/">docket</a>, including 
the
<A HREF="docket/index.shtml#146">proposed CMC</a>,
and 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#148">other documents</a>.

<A ID="2007-04-14"/>

<h4>Patent Update</h4>

As of April 13th, the court hadn't yet issued a ruling from the January 19th hearing. 
So the only news is that there is no news regarding that ruling.
<P>
But there has been other news. 
We have been watching Mr. Katzer's activities at the Patent Office. 
There were three continuation applications that were pending. 
One issued as a patent recently, but should not have. 
It was the exact same claims that were in its parent application, 
and the exact same patent specification. 
The only difference was the 5000+ pages of references which Mr. Katzer 
submitted in response to our charges of inequitable conduct. 
However, under 35 U.S.C. 101, Mr. Katzer was not entitled to get 
another patent with claims that were the exact same as the 
claims of an earlier patent. 
The examiner apparently made a mistake.
 
<P>
The good news is that, after wading through all 5000 pages of 
another continuation application, another examiner 
rejected all claims and questioned whether anything was 
patentable in the application. 
As a result, Mr. Katzer abandoned that application. 
While it is possible to revive an abandoned application, 
it was great news to see that no patent issued from that application.

<P>
We'll post any other news
here and send it to the 
<A HREF="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-legal-announce">jmri-legal-announce</a>
mailing list when it happens.

<A ID="2007-08-06"/>

<h4>DecoderPro.com Ordered Transferred</h4>

As  
<A HREF"#decoderpro.com.1">described previously</A>, 
Matt Katzer
registered the decoderpro.com domain name to
prevent us from using our own trademark. 
He then transferred it to current registrant Jerry Britton 
through a settlement agreement which required Jerry Britton 
to pay $20,000 and Katzer's attorneys fees if Jerry transferred 
the domain name to JMRI.  When we
filed our Complaint with the court, we included a
claim for cybersquatting and a request that the
Judge order the return of that domain name.

<P>
Katzer's lawyers seized on that request, and
argued that because we'd not "joined all
necessary parties" -- that is, the current
registrant Jerry Britton who lives on the other
side of the country -- the judge had to dismiss
the whole cybersquatting claim. There is a legal
rule that a case has to include all people whose
interest might be seriously harmed, so that they
can have a say in the case. Katzer tried to use this rule 
to force us to either drag in Jerry
Britton, another model railroader who just wants
Katzer to leave him alone, or drop our request to
get our domain name back.

<P>
To avoid bringing Jerry in, and to get our domain
name back, we brought a proceeding under the
"<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/#udrp">Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</a>" (UDRP). 
We filed a complaint with the World
Intellectual Property Organization, describing
Katzer's misbehavior and misuse of the
decoderpro.com domain name and asking them to
order that it be returned.

<P>
Focusing on Katzer's settlement agreement, the WIPO panel returned a 
<A HREF="http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2007/d2007-0763.html">decision</a>
that had an entire section on "Katzer's
Bad Faith", including:

<UL>
<LI>"Indeed, the evidence supports the conclusion
that Katzer had no purpose in registering the
name except to keep it out of others' hands,
including Complainant's hands."

<LI>"it is difficult to conceive of a legitimate
use Katzer could make of the Domain Name."

<LI>"In the Panel's view, there is essentially a
purpose on the part of Katzer to disrupt the
business of a competitor by interfering with
Complainant's exercise of his trademark rights."
</UL>
and ended with the statement that:
<UL>
<LI>"The Panel concludes that Complainant has
demonstrated sufficient evidence of bad faith
registration and use of the Domain Name on the
part of Katzer"
</UL>

The WIPO Panel then ordered the decoderpro.com
domain name transferred. 

<P>
It's undeniable -- this is a win for JMRI. An impartial
panel, experienced in Internet and trademark law,
has made a clear statement that Katzer had acted
in "bad faith". Although that's been clear to us
in the community since the beginning, having an
impartial panel ruling in our favor is a big step
toward holding Katzer accountable for his
actions. Further, it allowed us to continue to
press our cybersquatting complaint against
Katzer, and prevents Katzer from entangling Jerry
Britton in the case.


<A ID="2007-08-17"/>
<h4>Ruling on January 19th Motions</h4>

On August 17th, the 
<a href="docket/158.pdf">Court ruled</a>
on the motions from the 
<a href="#2007-01-19">January 19th hearing</a>.  
We won on perhaps the most important issue, but lost on several others. 
Perhaps the most striking part was the Court's decision to deny our 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#preliminjunction1">request for a preliminary injunction</a>. 
You can read the reasoning on 
<a href="docket/158.pdf">pages 8 through 11 of the ruling</a>, 
but the conclusion is:

<blockquote>
The condition that the user insert a prominent notice of attribution 
does not limit the scope of the license. 
Rather, Defendants' alleged violation of the conditions of the 
license may have constituted a breach of the nonexclusive license, 
but does not create liability for copyright infringement where it would 
not otherwise exist. 
Therefore, based on the current record before the Court, 
the Court finds that Plaintiff's claim properly sounds in contract and 
therefore Plaintiff has not met his burden of demonstrating likelihood 
of success on the merit of his copyright claim and is therefore not 
entitled to a presumption of irreparable harm.
</blockquote>

This is very troubling, both for us and for Open Source efforts in general.
<ul>
<li>The facts in this case are the strongest imaginable:  
Katzer admitted copying the JMRI files, 
admitted removing their copyright notifications, 
admitted being aware that JMRI was distributed under license, 
admitted redistribution of the modified version, 
and admitted doing it in violation of the license terms.  
This kind of problem could happen to any open source project.

<li>The ruling rests on the Court's uncertainty that 
an Open Source organization will <u>ever</u> be able to 
enforce copyright on software that can be downloaded from the Internet. 
The Court's reading of the law in this area expressed uncertainty, 
but in the end decided that our "claim properly sounds in contract", 
and therefore denied the preliminary injunction.

<li>This ruling is particularly troublesome, 
because the logic it contains can be used for any project 
which freely distributes software using something that 
can be construed as a "nonexclusive license".
</ul>

<p>We are carefully considering an appeal of this decision. 
As long as the Court's logic stands, we can't enforce our copyrights.  
Further, we need to get the strongest possible decision from an appeal, 
because the "uncertain law" will be clarified by that appeal and 
will apply to other cases in the future. 
We're going to need help to do that, and we're actively looking for that help.

<p>
The Court also dismissed our claim
against Katzer for 
<a href="UDRP/index.shtml">cybersquatting</a>.
The Court apparently misunderstood the reasoning behind our argument, 
and decided that we had waived our claim by saying that we were
only asking for the return of decoderpro.com "in rem".  On the 
contrary, we want Katzer held responsible under the law for 
his illegal actions, beyond just being forced to return our domain
name (which we now have back 
<a href="#2007-08-06">due to the WIPO</a>, not the Court), and
we said so in the hearing.
We are considering
how to go about getting this claim reinstated.

<a id="2007-09-05"/>
<h4>Request for Reconsideration on Cybersquatting Denied</h4>

On September 4th, 2007, we 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#159">asked the Court to reconsider</a>
its decision on the cybersquatting claim.
We believe that the Court misunderstood our argument.
Unfortunately, the Court has 
<a href="docket/161.pdf">denied this request</a>.  
<p>
We're considering what the next step will be.  We can wait 
until the rest of the case has been resolved, and then appeal this 
decision (you can't appeal something like this until it's final, and
that generally means when the case as a whole is complete), but we
are also investigating other alternatives.

<a id="2007-09-13"/>
<h4>Appeal of Copyright Ruling</h4>

On September 13, 2007, we appealed the Court's ruling on copyright to the 
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington DC.  
Over the next few months, a series of briefs will be filed, first
by us, then a reply from Katzer and then a final brief from our side before
a (possible) hearing before the Appeals Court next Spring.

<p>
We've added a
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/index.shtml">separate docket page</a>
for those who'd like to keep track of all the documents that will get filed.

<p>
This is an important part of the case, and we'd appreciate 
as much help as we can get.  
We're not just trying to get the Court's erroneous ruling
corrected for our own case, but because it's a very dangerous 
precedent for other open source and free software projects that
might find themselves in similar struggles against abuse.
Please, if you know people in open source organizations, suggest 
to them that they help with this.


<a id="2007-09-14"/>
<h4>Case Management Conference</h4>

On September 14, 2007, the Court held another 
<a href="docket/173.pdf">Case Management Conference</a>
to discuss a schedule for coming events.  

<p>
We continue to learn more and more about Katzer's misbehavior, 
and we want a new complaint before the Court to include as much of
it as possible.
Although we asked for until the end of October to prepare a 
a Second Amended Complaint, the Court 
<A HREF="docket/166.pdf">ordered us</a> 
to provide it to 
Katzer's lawyers by October 19th.

<a id="2007-10-31"/>
<h4>Filing Second Amended Complaint</h4>

On October 31st, 2007, we filed a 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#174">motion</a> 
requesting leave 
to file a second amended complaint.  This is a necessary step,
<a href="docket/166.pdf">ordered</a> by the Court, toward getting 
the new complaint before the Court.  
The motion includes two proposed versions.  We believe that our
<a href="#2007-09-05">cybersquatting claim for Katzer's misuse of the
decoderpro.com domain name</a> is a valid one, and we now have the
hearing transcript that proves we did not waive this claim.
We're therefore asking the Court to allow us to file a 
<a href="docket/174-2.pdf">version which includes cybersquating</a>.  
In the interest of time, however, 
we've also included a 
<a href="docket/174-2.pdf">version without that claim</a>
if the Court continues 
to believe that we've waived it.
In that case, we're asking the Court to allow us to go forward
with the version of the complaint without the cybersquatting claim, and
to declare the decision on that final so that we can appeal it.

<p>
We included a claim under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). 
You might wonder what DMCA has to do with open source software. 
DMCA has two main statutes. 
Section 1201 is the one which has to do with circumvention, 
and it is used more frequently of the two statutes.  
Many people in open-source and free software communities hate this section, 
for good reason.  
We are NOT suing under section 1201.
Then there's 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00001202----000-.html">Section 1202</a>,
rarely used so far, 
which forbids providing false copyright management information 
or removing copyright management information. 
We believe that 
<a href="copycomparison.html">Katzer's removal of JMRI copyright notices, author's names, and license terms</a> 
-- which qualify as copyright management information -- from 
our machine-readable XML decoder definitions is a violation of Sec. 1202.  
We believe this section is a great weapon we can use against Katzer to 
protect our intellectual property rights, 
so we charged Katzer and his company with a violation of this section.  
If we succeed, it will allow other open source groups to invoke this section
to defend their intellectual property,
and to obtain statutory damages and attorneys fees. 

<p>
Katzer's lawyer has already said he doesn't object to either version,
so we expect this will be straight-forward.

<a id="2007-12-11"/>
<h4>Second Amended Complaint Ruling</h4>

Although Katzer had previously agreed to the filing of either of our
draft complaints 
(see <a href="#2007-10-31">above</a>),
he's clearly still more interested in delaying the case rather than
resolving it, so on November 2nd, he filed an 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#178">opposition</a> to our 
request to file the complaint.  He then followed this up
with a 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#184">request for sanctions</a>.
<p>
In typical style, he misstated law and facts in these filings,
and didn't obey the Court's rules regarding notice.  
We filed a 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#185">motion</a>
pointing this out, and asking that the hearing on sanctions
be deferred until proper notice had been given.  
Katzer's
<a href="docket/index.shtml#186">reply</a>
included additional misrepresentations, and the 
Court 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#187">denied our motion</a>.
We felt we had no choice but to file our own
<a href="docket/index.shtml#188">motion for sanctions</a> to at least bring this 
misbehavior to the attention of the Court.
<p>
On December 11th, the Judge 
<a href="docket/190.pdf">allowed</a>
the filing of our preferred version of the new complaint and
<a href="docket/190.pdf">denied</a> the requests for sanctions.
<P/>
We then filed
<a href="docket/index.shtml#191">second amended complaint</a>
on December 12th. 
The Court has set a deadline
of January 4th, 2008, for Katzer to either file his reply, 
or start another round of motions.

<p>
This is a big victory for us.  
We've learned a lot about Katzer's misdeeds over the 
last year. This new complaint puts it all before the Court, 
including Katzer's cybersquatting,
and will (eventually) force him to reply in detail to each item. 
He's been able to avoid
doing that for almost two years, but his time is running out. 


<a id="2007-12-17"/>
<h4>Appeal Brief Filed</h4>

On December 17th, 2007, we filed our 
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/AppellantsBrief.pdf">appellant's brief</a>
in our 
<a href="#2007-09-13">appeal of the Court's copyright ruling</a>
with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
It lays out, in detail, the legal reasons
we believe that the District Court's copyright ruling is
incorrect and should be overturned.

<p>
Katzer's reply to this is due on January 29th, 2008.

<a id="2007-12-21"/>
<h4>Yet Another Motion From Katzer</h4>

On December 21, 2007, Katzer filed his
<a href="docket/192.pdf">3rd motion to dismiss</a>
parts of the complaint. We're still analyzing it
and will decide how best to reply soon.

<a id="2007-12-28"/>
<h4>Key Open Source Organizations File Brief Supporting JMRI</h4>

On December 28, 2007, a 
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/ccc_mtn.pdf">motion to file an amicus brief</a>, 
along with the
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/ccc_brf.pdf">brief itself</a>,
was filed in our appeal by
<ul>
<li>Creative Commons Corp, 
<li>The Linux Foundation,
<li>The Open Source Initiative, 
<li>The Software Freedom Law Center, 
<li>Yet Another Society (Perl Foundation), and 
<li>The Wikimedia Foundation.
</ul>
An "amicus brief" is a way for a "friend of the Court"
to explain to the Court the larger issues involved in a case.
They can be very helpful in making sure that decisions
with far-reaching consequences are made properly.
Here, the amici clearly laid
out how copyright protection is key to the success of open source and free software,
and educated the Court on why that matters.
It's a very strong argument, which should be widely read.
<p>
Katzer's deadline to oppose entry of this brief has now passed, and we hope that 
the Court will accept it soon.

<a id="2008-01-18"/>
<h4>Our Response to Katzer's Contract, Copyright and DMCA Arguments</h4>

On January 18, 2008, we filed
<a href="docket/index.shtml#198">our response</a>
to Katzer's 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#192">most recent motion to dismiss</a>. 
That motion attempted to
get rid of various parts of our recent Second Amended Complaint
regarding copyright, contract and DMCA violations.
In our response, we show that Katzer misstated both law and facts, 
and show that the Court should allow us to hold Katzer
responsible for his actions in stripping the 
copyright management information out of the JMRI files, for repeatedly infringing
JMRI copyrights, and, if Katzer's argument that he had a contract is valid, for
violation of that contract.
<p>
The next step will be Katzer's reply, due on Friday January 25th, which we
will post on the 
<a href="docket/index.shtml">docket page</a> when it arrives, followed 
by a hearing on March 14th.

<h4>Amicus Brief Accepted</h4>

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has accepted the 
<a href="#2007-12-28">amicus brief filed by six free and open source organizations</a>.
This means that the Federal Circuit will consider
arguments from the amicus brief when the judges hear 
the case later this spring.

<a id="2008-01-23"/>
<h4>Deadline For Settlement Disclosures Set</h4>

The Court has ordered both sides to take part in a settlement conference, 
now scheduled for February 13th before Judge Elizabeth Laporte.  
The judge has 
<a href="docket/199.pdf">ordered Katzer</a>
to provide his 
"position on validity, enforceability and infringement of the '329 patent". 
This order is a positive step for us.  
We've been trying for years to get Katzer to say why he thinks his patents are valid, 
and why he thinks 7,000 people have infringed them. 
We think he knows that his patents are invalid and unenforceable,
and that he knows his claims of thousands of infringements are a dishonest 
attempt to extract money that no one ever owed to him. 
Many of his actions in this case seem to have been intended to delay 
proceedings so he wouldn't have to provide a detailed answer to the complaint, 
including this information. Now he's been ordered to provide it by January 31, 2008.  
We're looking forward to getting this information.

<a id="2008-02-12"/>
<h4>Katzer Doesn't Provide Disclosures, Disclaims A Patent, Moves to Dismiss</h4>

Katzer had been ordered to explain by January 31st why he thought that his '329 patent
was valid and why Jacobsen infringed. 
He didn't provide the disclosures required by Judge Laporte, 
so he was in violation of the order.  
Instead, on February 1st, 
<a href="docket/203-2.pdf">he filed a disclaimer of that patent</a>
with the US Patent Office. 
The disclaimer treats the patent as if it never existed, 
so no one can ever be charged with infringing the '329 patent.  
Getting that disclaimer out of Katzer is a victory for JMRI, 
because it removes the threat of that patent.
<p>
But Katzer has repeatedly said that he believes that Jacobsen 
is infringing multiple patents.  
He said it to the U.S. Department of Energy and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 
when he filed a FOIA request for information relating to Jacobsen, 
and included a bill for $200,000 for the supposed infringement.  
He also said it several times to the Court. 
Because he has thirteen other patents, 
Katzer can still use his patents against JMRI and other model railroaders. 
Preventing him from asserting the '329 patent was therefore just the start. 
There is more work to do to prevent Katzer from asserting other ill-gotten patents 
against innocent parties.
<p>
In the meantime, to avoid judgment being entered against him, 
Katzer asked the Court to dismiss our request for three declaratory 
judgment causes of action relating to patent as "moot". 
Katzer is saying that since he disclaimed '329, nobody has anything to fear, 
and our patent causes of action should be dismissed because federal courts 
do not decide matters unless there is a "case or controversy", in legal lingo, 
keeping the matter alive. 
(His motion asking for this is linked 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#203">here</a>)
Because Katzer has repeatedly said Jacobsen infringed multiple patents, 
we'll be fighting this vigorously, 
including filing a motion for early discovery to determine what other
patents Katzer believes that Jacobsen infringed.

<a id="2008-02-13"/>
<h4>Settlement Conference</h4>

On February 13, 2008,
we had a settlement conference before Judge Laporte at the San Francisco Federal Courthouse.
Discussions in settlement conferences are confidential, 
so we are severely limited in what we can discuss about what happened there, 
except of course what's in public orders. The case didn't settle,
and that's about all we can say.

<a id="2008-02-15"/>
<h4>Hearing Rescheduled</h4>

The hearing on Katzer's motion to dismiss contract and DMCA violations 
(discussed briefly 
<a href="#2008-01-18">above</a>)
was scheduled for March 14th. 
The Court has ordered that this be combined with the hearing on his 
<a href="#2008-02-12">motion to dismiss the patent claims</a>,
and scheduled the combined hearing for April 11, 2008.


<a id="2008-02-29"/>
<h4>Motions for For Early Discovery &amp; Rescheduling Denied</h4>

As we mentioned earlier, 
Katzer repeatedly said Jacobsen infringed multiple patents.  
He was under an order to produce disclosures on why he thought 
Jacobsen infringed a valid and enforceable patent, 
but instead, Katzer tried to pull the rug out from under us 
by filing a disclaimer on the '329 patent, 
and then moving to dismiss the declaratory judgment causes of action relating to patent. 
We filed a 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#207">request for early, limited discovery</a>
to get the identities of all patents that Jacobsen supposedly infringed, 
along with a corresponding request to move the briefing deadline back so 
that we had time to get the information.
Katzer of course 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#210">opposed this</a>. 
The Court 
<a href="docket/212.pdf">declined to order Katzer to provide the information on other supposedly infringed patents</a>, 
so we filed our
<a href="docket/index.shtml#213">response to the motion to dismiss</a>
the patent parts of the case that same day.

<a id="2008-03-21"/>
<h4>Katzer Disclaimed Not One, but Two Patents!</h4>

On March 18th, the U.S. Patent Office published two disclaimers, 
not just one, that Katzer had filed on Feb. 1, 2008.  
One is the '329 patent mentioned above, 
and the other is U.S. Patent No. 7,177,733.
<p>
We had pointed out that the '733 patent is invalid for "Section 101 double patenting":
It has, word-for-word, the exact same claims as an earlier patent, 
U.S. Patent No. 6,909,945, which issued from '733's parent continuation application. 
Katzer and his patent attorney, Kevin Russell, 
had repeatedly filed patent applications that had the exact same claims as 
in earlier issued Katzer patents.  
(See the 
<a href="docket/191.pdf">Second Amended Complaint, paragraphs 135 - 221</a>
for details on Katzer's double patenting.)
<p>  
Katzer and Russell are supposed to tell the examiners if they file copied claims, 
but they repeatedly didn't.  
Most of the time, the patent examiners caught this and 
rejected the claims as improper under Section 101 of the patent law.
<p>  
Back in 2006, when we filed our original complaint, 
we identified a number of examples of "prior art", 
which are examples showing that other people had already created 
what Katzer claimed he invented. 
While we were fighting the anti-SLAPP motions, 
we produced other examples of prior art.
Katzer and Russell took those examples, and added several more, 
and submitted them as part of the application that later issued as the '733 patent.  
In total, Katzer and Russell submitted between 5,000 and 6,000 pages.  
Although the examiner who was
working on this application had also handled the previous application that 
issued as the identical '945 patent, 
she must have been overwhelmed by the thousands of pages of newly produced references, 
and missed that those claims had improperly been filed again.  
She allowed the '733 patent to issue.
<p>
Our Second Amended Complaint put this situation before the Court as
part of demonstrating that Katzer has a pattern of misleading the Patent Office.
With pressure on them over the '733 reference, 
Katzer had Russell disclaim the entire '733 patent, as well as the '329 patent.

<a id="2008-04-04"/>
<h4>Two Surreplies</h4>

Normally, when one party makes a motion, the other party
gets to file an "Opposition", the original party gets to 
reply to that opposition, and that's it.  There's then
a hearing and the Court decides.  The side making the motion is supposed to put all
their arguments in the original motion.
<p>
In the case of two most recent motions, however,
Katzer raised new arguments in his replies.  
The only place we get a chance to refute those new arguments is
via a "surreply", but we have to ask the Court for permission to file that.
Because Katzer raised new arguments in his reply for each of two motions,
we've asked the court for permission to file a 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#217">surreply for the copyright motion</a> and a 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#215">surreply for the patent motion</a>.
These include the surreplies themselves
(<a href="docket/217-2.pdf">copyright surreply</a>,
<a href="docket/215-2.pdf">patent surreply</a>), if you'd like to read them.

<a id="2008-04-11"/>
<h4>April 11, 2008 Hearing</h4>

We had a hour-long hearing in the Northern District of 
California on April 11th, 2008.
It was nice to see so many supporters there!
<p>
The day before, the court had issued a
<a href="docket/219.pdf">Notice of Tentative Ruling and Questions</a>
which indicated that the preliminary decision was to grant some parts
of the motions and deny others.  Much of the hearing was spent on the 
patent aspects of the case, but copyright also received some attention.
We'll post the transcript on the 
<a href="docket/index.shtml">docket page</a> and link to it from here as soon as it's available.

<p>
At the hearing, the Judge did not indicate what his decision will be.
We'll let you know as soon as we see it.


<a id="2008-04-16"/>
<h4>Events in the Copyright Appeal</h4>

There are some recent events in our copyright appeal to the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit in Washington DC.

<p>
On April 4th, 2008, Creative Commons Corp, The Linux Foundation, 
The Open Source Initiative, Software Freedom Law Center, 
Yet Another Society and Wikimedia Foundation 
filed a 
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/30.pdf">request to be allowed to participate in oral argument</a>
at the hearing
on May 7, 2008 in Washington DC.
Katzer promptly filed an 
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/32.pdf">opposition</a>. 
We filed a 
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/34.pdf">reply</a> which argued that
the amici have useful things to say, and requested that the
court allow them to present their views.
The amici also filed a 
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/36.pdf">reply</a> 
describing how they would be presenting
information the Court would find useful.
Unfortunately, the Court
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/37.pdf">denied the request</a>.

<p>
Separately, also on April 4th, Katzer filed a
"<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/33.pdf">Notice of Supplemental Authority</a>".
This is a way to bring a recently-decided case to the
attention of the court. Katzer cited
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/33-1.pdf">Netbula v. Storage Technology</a>,
which is about two companies that negotiated a contract so Storage Tech
could use copyrighted material that belonged to Netbula.  
When that deal went bad, Netbula accused
Storage Tech of copyright infringement, but the Judge in the case
found for Storage Tech.  
We've filed a 
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/35.pdf">reply</a>, arguing that this case is very different from ours.
In our case, we didn't negotiate a contract, and Katzer never did anything
to accept one; no contract exists or has ever existed between us, so 
Katzer is clearly an infringer.  Katzer seems to be citing this case
to attempt to befuddle the Court about the facts, not to update them
on the law.

<a id="2008-05-07"/>
<h4>May 7, 2008 Copyright Appeal Hearing</h4>

On May 7, 2008, we argued our copyright appeal at the Federal Circuit
in Washington DC.  
Each side had been given 15 minutes to argue their case.
Chief Judge Michel, Judge Prost, and a visiting judge, Judge Hochberg, were on the panel.
<p>
We were first up.
The three Judges asked about
whether anything Katzer did could have formed a contract,
what we expected from him under our license,
and what effect their ruling would have on further proceedings in the district court.
They seemed particularly interested in the Open Source development 
model, and whether Katzer's arguments meant that there was no way to hold
him to account for his infringement of the copyrights.
<p>
When it was Katzer's attorney's turn,
they asked him why Katzer didn't just accept
an injunction against using the JMRI files,
since he claimed to no longer use them and that
he had no future use for them.  
He had to admit that the District Court Judge had ruled that the infringement could recur.
They next asked why Katzer didn't just comply with one of the 
many options within the license for using the material.  
In replying to this, Katzer's attorney claimed that
Katzer had downloaded the decoder definitions as part 
of his interest in furthering industry standards, and that he thought
he could use them as he wished. 
Complying with the license "never crossed his mind".
They also quizzed him about whether Katzer knew about the terms, 
and how an author would go about 
protecting his rights if Katzer's arguments are accepted.
One Judge wondered whether Katzer was arguing for "Too bad, so sad", and 
asked whether this would make it impossible
to protect Open Source development under copyright.
<p>
It was a very interesting session, with a lot of thoughtful questions.
It was clear that the Judges had already carefully considered the issues.
There were enough questions that both sides were given 
several minutes past the fifteen minutes allotted.
The sound recording, approximately 40 minutes, is 
<a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2008-1001.mp3">available here</a>.
<p>
The next step will be the ruling from the Federal Circuit. 
There's no way to know precisely when that will be, but
we'll post it here as soon as we get it.

<a id="2008-08-13"/>
<h4>August 13, 2008 Copyright Appeal Decision</h4>

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
has issued its
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-1/08-1001.pdf">decision</a>
in our copyright appeal, and it's a ringing victory
for JMRI and open-source in general.

<p>
In summary, the Court decided:
<ul>
<li>The Artistic License does put valid conditions on the use 
of licensed software.
<li>Those conditions limit the copyright license, and 
actions outside them are infringement. 
<li>An injunction to stop that infringement is a suitable remedy.
</ul>

<p>
Specifically, the Court wrote:

<blockquote>
It is outside the scope of the Artistic License to modify and distribute 
the copyrighted materials without copyright notices and a tracking of 
modifications from the original computer files. 
If a downloader does not assent to these conditions stated in the COPYING
file, he is instructed to "make other arrangements with the Copyright Holder." 
Katzer/Kamind did not make any such "other arrangements."
The clear language of the Artistic License creates conditions to protect the 
economic rights at issue in the granting of a public license. 
These conditions govern the rights to modify and distribute the 
computer programs and files included in the downloadable software package. 
The attribution and modification transparency requirements directly 
serve to drive traffic to the open source incubation page and to inform 
downstream users of the project, which is a significant 
economic goal of the copyright holder that the law will enforce. 
Through this controlled spread of information, the copyright holder 
gains creative collaborators to the open source project; by requiring that 
changes made by downstream users be visible to the copyright holder 
and others, the copyright holder learns about the uses for his software 
and gains others' knowledge that can 
be used to advance future software releases.
</blockquote>

<p>
The Appeals Court ruled that the lower court's decision is
"vacated and remanded". This returns the case to the District Court
for Northern California, which must decide on a remaining question
before issuing the injunction.

<p>
Although there will be some further proceedings, this is a huge
step forward for us.  The appellate judges have ruled that when Kater
took JMRI files, modified them, and distributed them
as if there were his own, he was violating copyright law and we can 
hold him accountable.  

<p>
It's also an important result for open-source software in general,
because (to quote 
<a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/08/huge_and_important_news_free_l.html">Larry Lessig's blog</a>):
<blockquote>
In non-technical terms, the Court has held that free licenses such as the CC licenses set conditions (rather than covenants) 
on the use of copyrighted work. 
When you violate the condition, the license disappears, meaning you're simply a copyright infringer. 
This is the theory of the GPL and all CC licenses. 
Put precisely, whether or not they are also contracts, they are copyright licenses which expire if 
you fail to abide by the terms of the license.

<p>
Important clarity and certainty by a critically important US Court.
</blockquote>

<p>
There's been a lot of public reaction to this ruling. 
Our <a href="news.html#CAFCruling1">"Articles by Others" page</a>
carries links to some of the commentary.

<h4>August 29, 2008 Status and Scheduling Conference</h4>

We had a status and scheduling conference before Judge White on August 29th, 2008. 
He decided that both sides were to resubmit their motions to simplify the record. 
We'll then have a hearing on all matters on
December 19th, after which he'd rule on all the motions.
<p>
Included in this is our request for a preliminary injunction 
under copyright laws (infringement and DMCA)
to stop Katzer from misusing JMRI files, 
and Katzer's motions to remove 
various parts of our Second Amended Complaint against him.
<p>
All of the documents will be made available on the
<a href="docket/index.shtml">docket page</a>
after they are filed.

<a id="2008-10-10"/>
<h4>October 10, 2008 Preliminary Injunction and Other Motions</h4>

At the <a href="#2008-08-29">August status conference</a>
the Court decided that both sides would resubmit
their written arguments to the Court.  
We have therefore filed two sets of documents with the Court.

<p>
The 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#236">first set</a>,
filed Friday October 3, 2008 is our 
<a href="docket/236.pdf">motion</a>
(and <a href="docket/index.shtml#236">related declarations</a>)
for a preliminary injunction
under both copyright law and the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA).

<p>
The 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#Refiled2ndSet">second set</a>,
filed October 10, 2008, 
are our oppositions to two motions by Katzer.
Back in December 2007, he filed his
"<a href="docket/192.pdf">Third Motion to Dismiss</a>",
asking the Court to dismiss our DMCA and breach of contract claims.
He also asked the Court to strike our request for statutory damages 
for Katzer's copyright infringement.
Our <a href="docket/240.pdf">response</a>
argues that these should remain.

<p>
In February 2008,
Katzer also filed a
"<a href="docket/203.pdf">Fourth Motion to Dismiss</a>"
seeking to have the 
patent claims removed because he disclaimed the '329
patent.  We argue in our 
<a href="docket/243.pdf">response</a>
(and <a href="docket/index.shtml#243">associated exhibits</a>)
that Katzer is attempting to evade responsibility
for his own bad acts, and that the law
says that we can still hold him responsible.

<p>
Katzer's responses to these are due on November 7, 2008.
We then get to file a reply regarding the preliminary injunction
by November 21, 2008. 
Those will all be added to the
<a href="docket/index.shtml">docket page</a> as soon as they are available.
At that point, all the paper briefing is done, and the Judge can 
decide the motions at any time.  
If he has any questions, those will be discussed
at a hearing, currently scheduled for December 19, 2008.

<a id="2008-10-15"/>
<h4>October 15, 2008 Katzer Request to Seal Declaration</h4>

On October 15, 2008, Katzer filed a 
<a href="docket/247.pdf">motion</a>
requesting that he be allowed to file a declaration "under seal". 
This is usually used for trade secrets and similar information
that shouldn't be made public. 
Putting the information under seal allows the Court and the parties to reference
it while still protecting the information from public disclosure.
In this case, however, Katzer has also asked that Jacobsen
not be allowed to see the information. 
<p>
We filed an 
<a href="docket/248.pdf">opposition</a> to this, pointing out that
Katzer's request didn't comply with the relevant
<a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/LocalRul.nsf/fec20e529a5572f0882569b6006607e0/7f39eafb2106e6db882569b4005a23f1?OpenDocument#TOC2_119">rules of civil procedure</a>, and puts us 
at an extreme disadvantage in rebutting Katzer's statements.

<p>
Katzer then filed another 
<a href="docket/249.pdf">declaration</a>, and several days 
later provided the declaration that he proposed to be sealed.  
We <a href="docket/251.pdf">replied</a>, pointing out several ways that Katzer's
request was still in violation of procedural rules and with basic fairness.
<p>
The Court agreed, and 
<a href="docket/252.pdf">ruled</a>
that Katzer could not submit his declaration under seal, 
but could ask again. Katzer didn't do so.

<a id="2008-11-07"/>
<h4>November 7, 2008 Katzer filings</h4>

On November 7th, 2008, Katzer filed documents in the three existing motions.
<p>

He filed a 
<a href="docket/257.pdf">reply</a> to our opposition to his motion to 
dismiss our patent claims as moot.  
He also filed a 
<a href="docket/258.pdf">reply</a> to our opposition to his other motion, to dismiss
and to strike parts of our complaint against him. At first glance, this
contain the same arguments as before, trying to distract the Court 
from the real issue that Katzer is likely to continue to assert his 
improperly obtained patents.
<p>
Interestingly, Russell also filed a
"<a href="docket/253.pdf">response</a>", along with a
<a href="docket/256.pdf">declaration</a> from Katzer and a 
<a href="docket/254.pdf">declaration</a> from Russell himself. 
We're not entirely certain that this is even a reponse
<u>to</u>, because Russell is no longer a party to the case at this own request.

<p>
We're still studying these, and will determine our next steps soon.

<a id="2008-11-07-pi"/>
<p>
As expected, Katzer also filed an 
<a href="docket/260.pdf">opposition</a>
to our motion for preliminary injunction, along with a
<a href="docket/261.pdf">declaration</a> from Katzer and a number of 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#261">exhibits</a>.
A first look indicates that Katzer is claiming that he <u>does</u> 
have permission to use the JMRI content because he holds the copyright on a
QSI manual, because the JMRI decoder definitions are merely "manufacturer information", 
and because they "build on an effort" started by Katzer "to construct a
master, uniform template of manufacturer's specification data". 
We disagree about all of this, and our reply will strongly rebut Katzer's evidence.
Katzer is clearly still asserting that he has a right to use our
content in violation of our license, and that he doesn't think
he's done anything wrong.  We also disagree about that.  Our reply to 
this is due November 21st, and will be on the 
<a href="docket/index.shtml">docket page</a> shortly after it's filed.



<a id="2008-11-21"/>
<h4>November 21, 2008 Our Copyright Reply</h4>

On November 21, 2008, we filed our
<a href="265.pdf">reply</a> to Katzer's opposition to our motion for
preliminary injunction (see <a href="#2008-11-07-pi">above</a>), along with a
<a href="docket/266.pdf">declaration</a> and a number of 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#266">exhibits</a>. We point out his mistatements of
facts and law, and use his own exhibits to demonstrate that his
story of why he thought he can use the JMRI decoder definitions isn't right.

<a id="2008-11-21-ms"/>
<p>
We also filed a 
<a href="docket/267.pdf">motion to strike</a>
parts of Katzer's and Russell's declarations.  Although they
should be allowed to tell their story, they aren't allowed to just
assert things without justifying them.  
The motion requests that the Judge disallow certain of their statements.  
Katzer and Russell talk about their beliefs that Jacobsen infringed and that the 
'329 patent was valid, but they didn't state the basis for this belief, 
which is required by the rules. 
Under the rules, Jacobsen is entitled to have those statements stricken.
We expect that Katzer will
respond to this pretty soon, and we'll post that when it becomes available.

<a id="2008-11-26"/>
<h4>November 26, 2008 Katzer Opposition Regarding Declarations</h4>

On November 26, 2008, Katzer filed a short
<a href="docket/268.pdf">opposition<a/> to our 
<a href="#2008-11-21"/>motion to strike</a> part of his declarations.
This was pretty much as expected.

<a id="2008-12-08"/>
<h4>December 8, 2008 Our surreply to Russell and Katzer</h4>

Normally, one side files a motion, the other side files an opposition,
and then the first side files a reply to the opposition.  The reply is
not supposed to carry new argument. When one side doesn't follow the
rules and raises new issues in a reply, or when new facts arise, a party
can ask for permission to file a "surreply" to comment on the new
argument or the new facts.

<p>
Because Katzer raised new issues after opposition was filed, and because
we now have additional information, we filed surreplies to both Katzer
motions on December 8, 2008.

<p>
The <a href="docket/272-2.pdf">copyright surreply</a>
refutes some of Katzer's arguments by showing
that he has misquoted case law or used case law that doesn't apply.
Katzer had argued that no statutory damages or attorneys fees were
available to Jacobsen because the first version of JMRI wasn't
registered prior to Katzer's infringement, but we showed that it doesn't
matter that the version wasn't registered. As long as some versions are
registered, and Katzer infringed those later versions after registration
or within three months of publication, then statutory damages and
attorneys' fees are available.

<p>
We filed the <a href="docket/274.pdf">patent surreply</a> 
because Katzer, and his intellectual
property attorney Kevin Russell, who had permission to file a response
but <a href="docket/index.shtml#253">filed it 4 weeks late</a>, 
filed responses in which they, once again,
tried to mislead the Court. We argued that the Court has jurisdiction to
hear the '329 patent because of anti-SLAPP and because Jacobsen is
prevailing party. Katzer and Russell said that they disclaimed the '329
patent because of "practical considerations" and "economic reasons", and
argued that our jurisdiction arguments were a motion for
reconsideration. We responded to these arguments to correct the record,
and discussed some new information that we had learned.

<h4>December 19, 2008 Hearing in Federal District Court</h4>

We had a hearing before the Judge on December 19th, 2008. Three
motions were addressed:

<ul>
<li>Katzer's <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/203.pdf">Motion to Dismiss</a> 
the patent actions for mootness

<li>Katzer's <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/192.pdf">Motion to Dismiss</a>
the DMCA and contract causes of action, and strike certain damages

<li>Bob Jacobsen's <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/236.pdf">Motion for Preliminary Injunction</a> to prevent
further copyright violations
</ul>

Two days before, the Court provided a 
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/279.pdf">Notice of Tentative Ruling and Questions</a>, 
which provided some background for what was going to
happen.

<p>
The Judge quizzed both sides about the questions he'd previously
provided, plus some additional questions. There was about 90 minutes
of discussion. He then took the case under submission, which means
he'll give his decision in a written ruling at a later date.

<h4>January 5, 2009 Court Rules on Motions</h4>

On January 5, 2009, the Court 
<a href="docket/284.pdf">ruled on all the pending motions</a>.
It was a mixed decision: The Court denied our request for a
preliminary copyright injunction, and granted some of Katzer's
motions but denied others. We're studying the implications of this ruling
and will provide more information when we can.
