    <h2>JMRI Defense: Keeping an Open-Source Project Alive</h2>
 
 <!-- the content goes here -->
 
JMRI is an open-source project for developers
to write software for model railroads.
It has achieved wide-spread acceptance, with more than a hundred
people writing parts, and users on every continent
except Antarctica (and we're working on that one!)
<P>
As an open-source project, JMRI software is distributed free of charge.
Our 
<A HREF="/Copyright.html#license">licensing terms</a>
require that nobody charge for the software itself, and that those
who do redistribute it 
must abide by certain restrictions: Give credit to
JMRI, don't take credit for themselves, etc.  It's not hard for 
anyone to understand and live up to those - except
one person.

<P>
For the last three years JMRI has been under attack
by Matt Katzer and his attorney Kevin Russell.
They have been using various coercive tactics, some of
which we believe are 
illegal, in an attempt
to put a stop to JMRI's work
or to extract money from JMRI.

<P>
Katzer, through his attorney Russell,
obtained a patent on 
model railroad technology that other people
had developed years before.
Using a
"continuation" application, they applied for a patent that
covered JMRI <i>after</i> JMRI had openly published its code.
Because Katzer and Russell didn't provide the prior art to the
Patent Office, the patent was promptly issued.

<P>
After the patent issued, 
Katzer and Russell first demanded $19, and later $29 in royalties
per downloaded copy of JMRI.
We believed that the patent was invalid because of prior art, 
and if they had provided the prior art in their possession 
to the patent examiner, 
that it would not have been granted in the first place.  
Russell sent Bob Jacobsen, one of the JMRI developers,
bills for more than $200,000 on 
a roughly monthly basis from August 2005 to January 2006.

<P>
When that harassment 
wasn't enough to stop the project, 
Katzer and Russell 
contacted Bob's employer 
in an attempt to intimidate him.  

<P>
In March 2006, we couldn't allow this to go on, and filed a 
<A HREF="docket/1.pdf">"Declaratory Judgment"</A> 
action
in Federal Court to get a legal determination
on our rights.

<P>
While we sought to hold Katzer and Russell responsible for certain of their
actions, such as contacting Bob's employer re the patents,
the Court sided with
Katzer and Russell and ruled that they
<A HREF="updates.html#2006-08-13">cannot be held responsible</a>
for them.
Those are no longer present in the complaint.

<P>
On the other hand, we've found 
<a href="copycomparison.html">compelling evidence</a> 
that Katzer took JMRI decoder definition files 
and included them in his
products, thereby thereby claiming them as his own, 
in violation of the JMRI license. 
We've therefore added copyright claims to the case by filing an
<A HREF="docket/96.pdf">amended complaint</a>
and asked for a preliminary injunction to stop
Katzer's misuse of our work.
In a motion to dismiss, Katzer
<A HREF="updates.html#2006-10-03">has argued</a>
that we can't use our copyrights to hold him responsible 
for his violations of the JMRI open-source license.
We <A HREF="updates.html#2006-11-03">replied</a> 
to show
that open-source licenses are valid and enforceable.
The District Court 
<A HREF="updates.html#2007-08-17">ruled</a>
that Katzer was right, and that we were not likely
to succeed on the merits of our copyright claim.
We disagreed emphatically with this, for 
<A HREF="updates.html#2007-08-17">multiple reasons</a>, 
and 
<a href="updates.html#2007-09-13">appealled</a>
the ruling.  Our first
<a href="docket/cafc-pi-1/AppellantsBrief.pdf">brief</a>, 
presents our side of the issue.
A strong consortium of free and open source
advocates, including 
Creative Commons Corp,
The Linux Foundation,
The Open Source Initiative,
The Software Freedom Law Center,
Yet Another Society (Perl Foundation), and
The Wikimedia Foundation, 
filed a 
<a href="http://localhost/k/updates.html#2007-12-28">"friend of the Court" brief</a>
supporting out position.
On August 13, 2008, the Appeals Court
<a href="">ruled entirely in our favor</a>, vacated
the District Court's decision, and remanded the case for
further proceedings.
There is still much to do regarding Katzer's copyright infringement, 
but we believe we will eventually win.

<P>
Katzer also improperly registered one of our
trademarks, DecoderPro,
as the domain name "decoderpro.com".
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
has 
<A HREF="http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2007/d2007-0763.html">ordered it returned to us</a>,
and wrote an entire section of the order on
"<a href="updates.html#2007-08-06">Katzer's bad faith</a>".
We think it's important to have the Court order Katzer not to 
repeat this type of misbehavior against JMRI or anybody else,
but the Court originally told us to remove the corresponding cybersquatting section.
After a 
<a href="updates.html#2007-12-11">series of motions</a>,
the Court has allowed us to include it in our 
<a href="docket/index.shtml#191">Second Amended Complaint</a>, which 
is currently moving forward.

<P>
These pages provide more detail on
what's happened so far
and
how we're defending against Katzer's actions.  
The navigation bar at the left will take
you to specific types of information. 

<P>
If this is your first encounter with us and our struggle to defend
our Open Source project, 
you might want to 
learn more by either reading our longer
<A HREF="updates.html">history to date</a>, or
see the 
<A HREF="news.html">"Articles by Others"</a> 
page to see what people not connected to JMRI are saying about this.

<P>
If you'd like to read all the legal filings, 
we've got them all available on a 
<A HREF="docket/index.shtml">separate page</a>.

<P>
If you're outraged by this situation, there are several things
you can do to help:
<UL>
<LI>
<a href="/donations.shtml">
 <img src="http://images.sourceforge.net/images/project-support.jpg" width="88" height="32" border="0" ALIGN="RIGHT" alt="Donate to JMRI" />
</a> 
<A HREF="donations.shtml">Contribute</a>
to help pay for legal expenses. JMRI gets no commercial revenue, and
patent litigation has costs for court fees, stenographers, etc.  
<LI><A HREF="priorart.html">Help with prior art</a>.
We know about lots of examples of "prior art" which can be used
to invalidate these patents.  We'd appreciate help finding more.
More importantly, we'd like help writing all of these up; it's a big
task to turn technical documentation into legal writing that can convince
a non-technical judge or jury. There's 
<A HREF="priorart.html">another page</a>
with info on how to help with this.

<P>
If you'd like to get email when we update these pages, please subscribe to the 
<A HREF="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-legal-announce">jmri-legal-announce</a>
mailing list at SourceForge.net.  
This will carry short announcements occasionally as news happens.
There won't be a lot of traffic.  
It's not a list for discussion and strategizing; for various reasons, 
we can't do that on a public list.
