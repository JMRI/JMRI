    <p>The <strong>Roster Groups</strong> function  allows you to take your entire roster and categorize it. At home you might want to break it down by  diesel vs. steam, or by railroad. At a  club it would be handy to have categories by member name in addition to any  other category you might think of. A  roster entry can be associated with more than one group. Again in a club environment, a roster entry  could be associated with the Steam, Union Pacific and John Member groups all at  the same time. There is always one group  present and it is called Global. All the  roster entries are in the Global Group. <br>

  <h4>Association of roster entries to a Roster Group</h4>
  <p> Once the groups are named, then you  &ldquo;associate&rdquo; the roster entries with their group.  This can be done two ways.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>    You can use the <strong>Associate  Roster Entry to Group </strong>to select a group and a roster entry. This method is best used when only a few associations  need to be made, like when a new loco has been added to the roster. Then you can concentrate on the groups it  belongs to.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>      The other method is to use  the <strong>Table Association</strong> selection. At  the top of the table you select the group you wish the roster entries to be  associated with, then the roster entries that you want to associate with that group.</p>
    </li>
  </ol></blockquote>

    </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once the  associations have been made, then you can select the Active Roster Group.  Once this is done then the Print and Print Summary actions will show only the  roster entries associated with that group. As an example you could select  the Group <strong>Santa Fe</strong> and only the roster entries in this Roster Group will  be printed. The printout does not currently show the active group in  the header. The active group will also influence any drop down  box which has a list of entries in it, such as Throttle, edit entry, copy,  etc. Also, when adding a new roster  entry it will automatically be associated with the currently active group, so  it is good practice when finishing working with a group to return the active  group to Global. </p>
  <h4><strong><em><br>
    Restoring Roster to include all Engines</em></strong></h4>
  <p><br>
    To return your roster to  show all engines, <strong>Set Active Roster Group</strong> to Global. Then you may be certain that you are  working with all engines in your  roster.</p>
