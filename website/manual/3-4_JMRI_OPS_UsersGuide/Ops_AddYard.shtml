<p align="left">Add<a href="Ops_Locations.shtml"> Location as Yards</a> and the <strong>Add Location </strong>window for Yards is opened from Add Location window. </p>
<p align="left"><br>
  To add a location as a Yard: in the <strong>Add Location</strong> window, type the<strong> Name</strong>
  <input name="textfield" id="textfield" type="text">
of the Yard location, note most of the window is greyed out until the
location is added. The location name must be unique; the program will
not allow two locations with identical names. However, if you want more
than one location to have the same name for your manifests and switch
lists, add a hyphen and a number to the locations name. For example,
"Boston-1" and "Boston-2" will print as "Boston". The program will
remove the hyphen and number when printing manifests and switch lists.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Operations at this location</strong>
  <input name="radio" id="radio" value="radio" checked="checked" type="radio">
  <strong>Yards</strong>, then press the
  <input name="button" id="button" value="Add Location" type="submit">

<p>A <strong>classification yard </strong>(US and Canada) or <strong>marshalling yard</strong> (UK and Canada)(including <strong>hump yards</strong>)
is a railroad yard found at some freight stations, used to separate
railroad cars on to one of several tracks. First the cars are taken to
a track, sometimes called a <strong>lead</strong> or a <strong>drill</strong>. From there the cars are sent through a series of switches called a <strong>ladder</strong> onto the classification tracks. Larger yards tend to put the lead on an artificially built hill called a <strong>hump</strong> to use the force of gravity to propel the cars through the ladder.</p>
<p>Freight trains that consist of isolated cars must be made into
trains and divided according to their destinations. Thus the cars must
be shunted several times along their route in contrast to a unit train,
which carries, for example, automobiles from the plant to a port or
coal from a mine to the power plant. This shunting is done partly at
the starting and final destinations and partly (for
long-distance-hauling) in classification yards.</p>
<p align="left">A yard will contain several tracks that must be defined. </p>
<p>Now after selecting all of the options for the yard, click on 
  <input name="button2" id="button2" value="Add Yard Track" type="button">
