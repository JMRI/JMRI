    If you already have a <span style="font-weight: bold;">DecoderPro&reg;
roster</span>
created when programming decoders, you may import them into the
Operations program. All locomotives that are not already in your
Operations roster will be imported and a message will be displayed
informing you of how many locomotives were imported. This way you can
use this tool any time you add locomotives to your DecoderPro&reg;
locomotive roster. The DecoderPro&reg; locomotive roster doesn't have the
locomotives length, so a default length is entered for you. You should
correct the locomotive length if you want the program to correctly
calculate your train lengths.
<p>Now we should have imported yoiur programming locomotive roster
into the
Operations Locomotives roster you will need to edit the entries to add the
attributes that are required for operations but were not needed in the Locomotive Roster file when you programmed the decorders.</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_EngineRoster.png" alt="Engine Roster" height="301" width="922"></p>
<p>These engines were imported from JMRI Roster, so we will need
to edit them to set the correct length, Consist, Location as required.<br>
<a href="Ops_EditEngines.shtml"><strong>Edit button</strong></a> in the Edit column will open the Edit Locomotives 
window and allow you to edit locomotive attributes..</p><p><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="Ops_SetEngines.shtml">Set button</a> in the Set column for each locomotive in the roster will allow you to set the location.</p><hr>
