<p><b>Operations Mode (Main Track) Programmer</b> - 
    or  <strong>Programming on the main(POM)</strong>. Opens the <strong>Operations Mode (Main Track)</strong> windowThis  lets you program a specific decoder on the layout, even while it is 
operating. However, because it addresses a specific  decoder address, some  decoders will not allow you to change the  decoder's address using this method!</p>
<p><img src="images/Programmer_Ops.png" width="424" height="167" alt="Ops programmer"></p>
<p>Some  command stations will only &quot;broadcast&quot; programming commands,  which can mean every locomotive on 
       the layout gets the same programming! The same is true if  you try to program a loco with address zero (or forget to enter an address when  you start). If in doubt, check  your documentation. </p>
<blockquote>  
 <strong>Reading  from your Decoder on the main:</strong><br>
    <br>
With a  few exceptions it is not possible to read from a CV on the Main.  If reading fails it usually reports as a 306 error (Timeout Talking to Command  Station.)<br>
<br>
<strong>Writing  to your decoder on the main:</strong> <br>
<br>
Program  on the Main writes are often called a &quot;blind write&quot; because there is  no response from the decoder that the write was successful. POM is very useful for tuning loco  performance while it is operating and the ack is the change in performance.<br>
The decoder  is first addressed by the Command Station, then the CV is addressed and then  the data that is to be written into that CV of that decoder is sent. An  exception is if address zero is used,(or you forget to enter an address when  you start). Then <strong>ALL</strong> decoders  on the main will write that data into the appropriate CV which usually is an &ldquo;unintended  consequence&rdquo;.</blockquote>
<p>Some command stations will only  &quot;broadcast&quot; programming commands, which can mean every locomotive on  the layout gets the same programming! If in doubt, check your documentation. </p>
<p>In this window you  select the locomotive in which you wish to change CV values, and what  programmer you want to use. Once they are selected you click <strong>Open Programmer</strong> button just as you would do in the <strong>Service  Mode programmer</strong>.</p>
