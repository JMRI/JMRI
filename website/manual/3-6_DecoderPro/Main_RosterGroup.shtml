<p>The <strong>Roster Groups</strong>
function allows you to take your entire roster and categorize it.
At home you might want to break it down by diesel vs. steam, or by
railroad. At a club it would be handy to have categories by
member name in addition to any other category you might think of.
A roster entry can be associated with more than one group. Again
in a club environment, a roster entry could be associated with the
Steam, Union Pacific and John Member groups all at the same time. There
is always one group present and it is called Global. All the
roster entries are in the Global Group.</p>

    </tbody></table>

<h4>Delete Roster Group</h4>

        <td align="left" valign="top" width="45%"><img src="images/Main_RosterGroup03.png" height="149" width="315"></td>

          <p>
            <input name="button4" id="button5" value="Cancel" type="submit">
            if you do not want to delete a roster Group</p>
          <p>

      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

<h4>Association of roster entries to a Roster Group</h4>
<p> Once the Roster Groups are named, you  &#8220;associate&#8221; the roster entries with their group. This can be done two ways:</p>
  <ol>
	<li>You can use the <strong>Associate  Roster Entry to Group </strong>to
	select a group and a roster entry. This method is best used when only a
	few associations need to be made, like when a new loco has been added
	to the roster. Then you can concentrate on the groups it belongs
	to.</li>
	<li>The other method is to use  the <strong>Table Association</strong>
	selection. At the top of the table you select the group you wish
	the roster entries to be associated with, then the roster entries that
	you want to associate with that group.</li>
  </ol>

<h4>Table Association</h4>
<p>Opens the <strong>Roster Group Table</strong> which allows you to assign Roster entries to a Roster Group.</p>
<p><img src="images/Main_RosterGroup04.png" alt="Roster Group Table" height="332" width="787"></p>
    <p>Select Roster Group:
      <select name="select3" id="select3"><option>Santa Fe</option></select>
    the roster group that you want to add entries to.</p>
    <p>The table shows all the Locomotives in your roster.</p>
    <p>In the right column, <strong>Add to...</strong> select the entries that you wish to add to
the Roster Group, click individually to select a single item, hold the
shift key down to select a range of items, hold the CNTRL key down to
randomly select items. Close the Table and the entries will be added to
the group.</p>

<h4>Add Roster Entry to Group</h4>
<p>Opens the <strong>Associate Roster Entry</strong> dialog with Group which allow you to select individual items.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="90%">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="51%"><img src="images/Main_RosterGroup05.png" height="264" width="357"></td>
    <td align="left" valign="top" width="49%"><p>Select the Roster Group 
      <select name="select4" id="select4"><option>AMTRAK</option></select></p>
      <p>In the next selection select the Locomotive to add to the group
        <select name="select5" id="select5"><option>Atlas SD26</option></select></p>
      <p>
        <input name="button5" id="button7" value="Cancel" type="submit">
if you do not want to associate a Loco to a roster Group</p>
      <p>
        <input name="button5" id="button8" value="OK" type="submit">
      Associates the selected Locomotive to the selected roster group.</p></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Once the associations have been made, then you
can select the Active Roster Group. Once this is done then the
Print and Print Summary actions will show only the roster entries
associated with that group. As an example you could select the
Group <strong>Santa Fe</strong> and only the roster entries in this
Roster Group will be printed. The printout does not currently
show the active group in the header. The active group will
also influence any drop down box which has a list of entries in it,
such as Throttle, edit entry, copy, etc. Also, when adding a new
roster entry it will automatically be associated with the currently
active group, so it is good practice when finishing working with a
group to return the active group to Global.</p>

<h4>Restoring Roster to include all Locos</h4>
<p>To return your roster to  show all Locos, <strong>Set Active Roster Group</strong> to Global. Then you may be certain that you are working with all Locomotives in your <a href="Main_Roster.shtml">Roster</a>.</p>

<h4>Remove Roster Entry from Group</h4>
<p>Opens the <strong>Remove Loco from Group</strong> dialog.</p>
    <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="90%">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td align="left" valign="top" width="53%"><img src="images/Main_RosterGroup06.png" height="115" width="358"></td>
        <td align="left" valign="top" width="47%"><p><strong>Select the Group</strong>
          <select name="select6" id="select6"><option>Santa Fe</option></select></p>
          <p>Select Loco
            <select name="select7" id="select7"><option>Atlas GP-30 3276</option></select></p>
          <p>
            <input name="button9" id="button9" value="Remove" type="submit">
            Removes the selected Loco from the selected Roster Group</p>
          <p>
            <input name="button10" id="button10" value="Exit" type="submit">
            Exits the dialog without changing the Roster Group</p></td>
      </tr>
