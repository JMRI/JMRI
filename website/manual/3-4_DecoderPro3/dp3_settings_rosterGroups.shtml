    <p>The <strong>Roster Groups</strong>
function allows you to take your entire roster and categorize it.
At home you might want to break it down by diesel vs. steam, or by
railroad. At a club it would be handy to have categories by
member name in addition to any other category you might think of.
A roster entry can be associated with more than one group. Again
in a club environment, a roster entry could be associated with the
Steam, Union Pacific and John Smith groups all at the same time. There
is always one group present and it is called Global. All the
roster entries are in the Global Group. </p>
    <h3>Hide/Show Roster Groups</h3>
    <p>The
Hide/Show Roster Groups control is used to toggle the Roster Groups
Display Panel on/off in the area highlighted in pink. This must first
be activated by clicking on the Settings tab and then clicking on
Hide/Show Roster Groups. If the Roster Groups panel does not
display when you click on the setting, try to grab the frame on the
left side of the area and drag it open (make sure the Hide/Show is in
the correct state.) </p>
The panel width may be sized by dragging the frame as indicated by the
red arrows. The small arrowheads will allow you to close the panel or
open the panel<br>

<h3> <a name="table"></a>Roster Group Table Association</h3>
<p> Once the groups are named, then you  &#8220;associate&#8221; the roster entries with their group.  This can be done by  using  the <strong>Table Association</strong>
selection. At the top of the table you select the group you wish
the roster entries to be associated with, then the roster entries that
you want to associate with that group.</p>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="images/dp3_setting_rosterGroup_table.png" alt="table" height="591" width="784"></p>
    <p>Select Roster Group:
      <select name="select3" id="select3"><option>Santa Fe</option></select>
    the roster group that you want to add entries to.</p>
    <p>The table shows all the engines in your roster.</p>
    <p>In
the right column, Include... select the entries that you wish to add to
the Roster Group, click individually to select a single item, hold the
shift key down to select a range of items, hold the CNTRL key down to
randomly select items. Close the Table and the entries will be added to
the group.</p>
  </blockquote>
</ul>
<p>Once the associations have been made, then you can select the
Active Roster Group. Once this is done then the Print and Print
Summary actions will show only the roster entries associated with that
group. As an example you could select the Group <strong>Santa Fe</strong>
and only the roster entries in this Roster Group will be printed.
The printout does not currently show the active group in the
header. The active group will also influence any drop down
box which has a list of entries in it, such as Throttle, edit entry,
copy, etc. Also, when adding a new roster entry it will
automatically be associated with the currently active group, so it is
good practice when finishing working with a group to return the active
group to Global. </p>
<h4><strong><em><br>
  Restoring Roster to include all Engines</em></strong></h4>
<p>    To return your roster to  show all engines, <strong>Select  Roster Group</strong> to All Entries, or Global. Then you may be certain that you are  working with all engines in your  roster.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disassociation of Roster Entry to Group</em></strong><br>
</p>
<p>To diassociate a roster entry to a Roster Group, open Roster Group
Table and uncheck roster selection and save new Group by closing the
Roster Group Table.</p>
