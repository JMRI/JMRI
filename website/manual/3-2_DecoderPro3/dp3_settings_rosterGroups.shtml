    <p>The <strong>Roster Groups</strong> function  allows you to take your entire roster and categorize it. At home you might want to break it down by  diesel vs. steam, or by railroad. At a  club it would be handy to have categories by member name in addition to any  other category you might think of. A  roster entry can be associated with more than one group. Again in a club environment, a roster entry  could be associated with the Steam, Union Pacific and John Smith groups all at  the same time. There is always one group  present and it is called Global. All the  roster entries are in the Global Group. </p>
    <h3>Hide/Show Roster Groups</h3>
    <p>The Hide/Show Roster Groups control is used to toggle the  Roster Groups Display Panel on/off in the area highlighted in pink. This must  first be activated by clicking on the Settings tab and then clicking on  Hide/Show Roster Groups. If the Roster  Groups panel does not display when you click on the setting, try to grab the  frame on the left side of the area and  drag it open (make sure the  Hide/Show is in the correct state.) </p>
The panel width may be sized by dragging the frame as indicated  by the red arrows. The small arrowheads will allow you to close the panel or  open the panel<br>

<h3> <a name="table"></a>Roster Group Table Association</h3>
<p> Once the groups are named, then you  &ldquo;associate&rdquo; the roster entries with their group.  This can be done by  using  the <strong>Table Association</strong> selection. At  the top of the table you select the group you wish the roster entries to be  associated with, then the roster entries that you want to associate with that group.</p>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="images/dp3_setting_rosterGroup_table.png" width="784" height="591" alt="table"></p>
    <p>Select Roster Group:
      <select name="select3" id="select3">
        <option>Santa Fe</option>
      </select>
    the roster group that you want to add entries to.</p>
    <p>The table shows all the engines in your roster.</p>
    <p>In the right column, Include... select the entries that you wish to add to the Roster Group, click individually to select a single item, hold the shift key down to select a range of items, hold the CNTRL key down to randomly select items. Close the Table and the entries will be added to the group.</p>
  </blockquote>
</ul>
<p>Once the  associations have been made, then you can select the Active Roster Group.  Once this is done then the Print and Print Summary actions will show only the  roster entries associated with that group. As an example you could select  the Group <strong>Santa Fe</strong> and only the roster entries in this Roster Group will  be printed. The printout does not currently show the active group in  the header. The active group will also influence any drop down  box which has a list of entries in it, such as Throttle, edit entry, copy,  etc. Also, when adding a new roster  entry it will automatically be associated with the currently active group, so  it is good practice when finishing working with a group to return the active  group to Global. </p>
<h4><strong><em><br>
  Restoring Roster to include all Engines</em></strong></h4>
<p>    To return your roster to  show all engines, <strong>Select  Roster Group</strong> to All Entries, or Global. Then you may be certain that you are  working with all engines in your  roster.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disassociation of Roster Entry to Group</em></strong><br>
</p>
<p>To disassociate a roster entry to a Roster Group, open Roster Group Table and uncheck roster selection and save
new Group by closing the Roster Group Table.</p>
