        Enter the name of your railroad. This  name will show up on your manifests You may use a different name for every train in your roster. See <a href="Ops_Trains.shtml">Train Options</a> for details<strong>.<br>

        <input name="checkbox2" type="checkbox" id="checkbox2" checked>      
        <strong>East/West</strong><br>
        If your railroad depicts trains traveling north and south select the  "North/South" box, if your trains travel east and west select the  "East/West" box. You must select at least one direction, and can if  desired select both.      </p>
        <p><strong>Scale</strong><br>
          Select the radio button for the scale of your railroad. This will be used  in calculating scale feet when you enter actual inches.
            <strong>S</strong>elect the scale you are modeling. This is useful when you enter  the length of cars and tracks. You can enter the number of actual inches  and the program will convert to scale feet. Append a double quote to the  length when entering actual inches. The program will also automatically  assign the proper NMRA weight for a car based on scale and length.<br>

          <strong>Maximum Train Length(ft)</strong>
          <input type="text" name="textfield2" id="textfield2"> 
          <br>
          This field provides the maximum default train length between cities.  Later you can override this length if you wish a shorter train between  any two locations. A 1000 foot train can carry approximately 20 cars,  and is of course dependent on the car lengths assigned to the train.<br>

          Maximum Locos per Train</strong>
          <input type="text" name="textfield3" id="textfield3">
          <br>
          Now set the maximum number of locomotives that you want the program to  assign to a train. If you don't want the program assigning engines, set  this value to 0.<br>

          <br>
          The program when generating switch lists for the various locations on  your railroad, will estimate the arrival times for your trains based on  the train's departure time and the switch and travel times. Enter the  average number of minutes it takes to drop or pickup a car on your  railroad. Then enter the average amount of time in minutes it takes to  travel from one location to the another. Later when you create a <strong><a href="Ops_Routes.shtml">route</a></strong><br>
          you will be able to increase or decrease the train's travel time betwee any two locations.<br>
