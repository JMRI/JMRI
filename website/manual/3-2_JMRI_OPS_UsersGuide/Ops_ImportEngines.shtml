<h4>Import locomotives from roster</h4>
<p>If you already have a <a href="Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">DecoderPro&reg; roster</a>
created when programming decoders, you may import them into the
Operations program. All locomotives that are not already in your
Operations roster will be imported and a message will be displayed
informing you of how many locomotives were imported. This way you can
use this tool any time you add locomotives to your DecoderPro&reg;
locomotive roster. The DecoderPro&reg; locomotive roster doesn't have the
locomotives length, so a default length is entered for you. You should
correct the locomotive length if you want the program to correctly
calculate your train lengths.</p>
<p>Now we should have imported your programming engine roster into the
Operations Engine roster you will need to edit the entries to add the
attributes that are required for operations but were not needed in the
Engine Roster file when you programmed the decoders.</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_EngineRoster.png" alt="Engine Roster" height="301" width="922"></p>
<p>These engines were imported from JMRI Roster, so we will need to
edit them to set the correct length, Consist, Location as required.<br>
  Press
  <input name="button8" id="button8" value="Edit" type="submit">
  to the right of the engine that you wish to edit and the <strong>Edit Engine</strong> window is opened</p>

      <p><strong>Road Number</strong> was imported correctly.</p>
      <p><strong>Model</strong> was imported correctly</p>
      <p><strong>Type </strong>was not in Roster so set to

      <p><strong>Length</strong> was set to default
        <select name="select11" id="select11"><option>50</option></select>

        which is the correct length of body not including couplers.</p>
      <p><strong>Horsepower</strong> was not imported, so set to
        <input name="textfield5" id="textfield5" value="1600" size="15">
        as this model was basically two 2500 HP units on a single frame.</p>
      <p><strong>Location</strong> is not imported from the Roster, So I located the locomotive at
        <select name="select13" id="select13"><option>North Yard</option></select>

<h4><a name="FromFile"></a>Import locomotives from a File</h4>
The import from file function requires an ACSII text file, with one
line for each locomotive. The import order is locomotive number,
locomotive road name, locomotive model, and locomotive length. The
following shows two examples of the correct format:
<p>236 UP RS4 40 <br>
5578 SP SW1200 42</p>
<p>Each line can start with a space and multiple spaces between fields
is okay. Optionally you can include additional information in the
following order, owner name, date built, and location. The location can
have two fields, the location name followed by the location's siding or
yard name separated by a hyphen. The following shows two examples of
the correct format:</p>
<br>
236 UP RS4 40 AT 1930 Home Town USA - locomotive Terminal <br>
5578 SP SW1200 42 DB 1934 York - York locomotive Yard
<p>If you prefer to use comma delimiters instead of spaces, place the
word "comma" at the start of your import file and use commas instead of
spaces. The following are two examples of importing locomotives with
comma deliminters.</p>
<p>comma <br>
  236,UP,RS 4,40,AT,1930,Home Town USA,-,locomotive Terminal <br>
  5578,SP,SW 1200,42,DB,1934,Town of York,-,York locomotive Yard</p>
<p>You need to be very careful with spaces when importing a comma
delimitated file. The program will include leading and trailing spaces
if they exist between the commas.</p>
<p> Note that the program will only add locomotives that don't exist in
the program's locomotive roster. It the locomotive already exists, it
will be skipped by the program.</p>
<p>After importing your locomotives, you must save them if you want to
keep them as part of your roster then edit them as you done for imports
from the programming roster above.. Select any locomotive in the <strong>locomotive</strong> window by pressing 
  <input name="button" id="button" value="Edit" type="submit">
and then press 
<input name="button2" id="button2" value="Save" type="submit">
that can be found at the bottom  right of the <strong>Edit locomotive</strong> window</p>
