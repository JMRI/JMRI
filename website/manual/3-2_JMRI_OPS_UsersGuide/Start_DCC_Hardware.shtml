<p>You will need, a means to connect between your computer and the track on which the  locomotive rests, that will take serial instructions and generate DCC packets  on the rails. At a minimum, a command station/booster( your DCC system will probably suffice),
an additional hardware interface to send commands from your computer to the command station (this could be as simple as a serial cable), and a programming track set up according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p> For some systems, you will also need an additional hardware interface to
  send the commands from your computer to the command station, and from there
  on to the decoder in the locomotive. For a Digitrax system, for example,
  you will need either the <b>MS100 interface</b>, <strong>PR3 programmer</strong> or a <b>LocoBuffer</b>. The <b>PR1</b> device
  from Digitrax is a stand-alone programmer and is <span class="ACCENT">not</span> usable with this software.
</p>
<p>For those who do not have any DCC hardware yet and are  considering purchasing a DCC locomotive and want to use DecoderPro to program  it consider the SPROG II USB. It has all  the electronics in one package with enough output to run a locomotive. It comes complete with the USB cable, power  supply, instructions and JMRI on disk.  All you need in addition, is the test track.</p>
<p>You will also need, of course, some locomotives with the decoders  installed  which you can
  program.
