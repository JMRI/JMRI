<p align="left">A spur is used to service an industry. To add a spur, press 
  <input type="button" name="button17" id="button17" value="Add Spur"> 
. Spurs are very similar to <strong><a href="Ops_AddYard.shtml">Yards</a> . </strong>You can if you with schedule the order that cars will be delivered to a spur, or demand cars with certain loads using <strong><a href="Ops_schedule.shtml">Schedules</a>.</strong></p>
<p align="left">When a car is placed at a spur the car's load status is modified. The program provides two load names for all cars. The default <strong>Empty</strong> or <strong>E</strong>  and the default <strong>load</strong> or <strong>L</strong>. If a car has one of these loads when it arrives at a spur, the load will change to the other, i.e. <strong>E</strong> becomes <strong>L</strong> and <strong>L</strong> becomes <strong>E</strong>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Ops_AddSiding.png" width="703" height="620" alt="Add Siding"></p>
<p><br> 
  To add a location as a spur, in the <strong>Add Location</strong> window, type the<strong> Name</strong>
  <input type="text" name="textfield" id="textfield"> 
of the spur location, note most of the window is greyed out until the location is added. The location name must be unique; the program  will not allow two locations with identical names. However, if you want  more than one location to have the same name for your manifests and  switch lists, add a hyphen and a number to the locations name. For  example, "Boston-1" and "Boston-2" will print as "Boston". The program  will remove the hyphen and number when printing manifests and switch  lists.</p>
<p>Now select <strong>Operations at this location</strong>
<input name="radio" type="radio" id="radio" value="radio" checked> 
  <strong>Spurs</strong>, then press the
  <input type="submit" name="button" id="button" value="Add Location"> 
at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p>A siding can be an industry or any place where a car  is loaded or unloaded. For a train to service a location, there must be  at least one track for that location. </p>
<p>This opens the <strong>Add Location</strong> window with all the options enabled.</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_AddLocation02.png" width="760" height="615" alt="location"></p>
<p>You may select <strong>This location is serviced by trains traveling</strong>, select at least or any number of the directions depending on access to your siding. We have selected 
  <input name="checkbox" type="checkbox" id="checkbox" checked>
East and
<input name="checkbox2" type="checkbox" id="checkbox2" checked> 
West
</p>
<p>You can decide which train direction the location can service. For  example, if only south bound trains can access the location select  "South" and deselect the other directions. This can be useful if you  want to support only trailing point switching for a given location. If a  location can support multiple directions then select the ones that are  appropriate. </p>
<p>Local Switcher: If you want only a local switcher to service a siding, deselect all of  the direction boxes for that siding. The program will only allow a train  that has one location in its route (local switcher) to service the  siding. This would be useful if you wanted your trains to pick up and  drop cars to a yard, and then have a local switcher move them to the  town's sidings.    </p>
<p>Next <strong>Select the rolling stock serviced by this location</strong>, note the 
  <input type="submit" name="button2" id="button2" value="Clear All">
and 
<input type="submit" name="button3" id="button3" value="Select All"> 
may be used to select. We have used the Clear All button and then selected 
<input name="checkbox3" type="checkbox" id="checkbox3" checked> 
<strong>Boxcar</strong> and
<input name="checkbox4" type="checkbox" id="checkbox4" checked> 
<strong>Gondola</strong> for this location. </p>
<p>You can control the rolling stock a location can service. Push
  <input type="submit" name="button7" id="button7" value="Clear All">
   to deselect all types, or
   <input type="submit" name="button8" id="button8" value="Select All">
to select all types,  then select or deselect the rolling stock you wish the location to  accept.</p>
<p>Since the <strong>Operations at this location </strong>is a
<input name="radio2" type="radio" id="radio2" value="radio2" checked> 
  <strong>Spurs</strong> the
  <input type="button" name="button4" id="button4" value="Add Spurs Track"> 
  is now enabled near the bottom of the window.
</p>
<p>We also have the option to 
  <input type="submit" name="button5" id="button5" value="Delete Location">
or 
<input type="submit" name="button6" id="button6" value="Save Location">
</p>
<p>Press 
  <input type="button" name="button9" id="button9" value="Add Spur Track"> 
then the <strong>Add Spur Track</strong> window is displayed, so that you can detail the spur</p>
