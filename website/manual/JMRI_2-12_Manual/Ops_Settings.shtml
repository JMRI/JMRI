        <input type="text" name="textfield" id="textfield">      
        <br>
        Enter the name of your railroad. This  name will show up on your manifests You may use a different name for every train in your roster. See <a href="Ops_Trains.shtml">Train Options</a> for details<strong>.<br>

        <input name="checkbox2" type="checkbox" id="checkbox2" checked>      
        <strong>East/West</strong><br>
        If your railroad depicts trains traveling north and south select the  "North/South" box, if your trains travel east and west select the  "East/West" box. You must select at least one direction, and can if  desired select both.      </p>
        <p><strong>Scale</strong><br>
          Select the radio button for the scale of your railroad. This will be used  in calculating scale feet when you enter actual inches.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Maximum Train Length(ft)</strong>
          <input type="text" name="textfield2" id="textfield2"> 
          <br>
          This field provides the maximum default train length between cities.  Later you can override this length if you wish a shorter train between  any two locations. A 1000 foot train can carry approximately 20 cars,  and is of course dependent on the car lengths assigned to the train.<br>
          <strong><br>
          Maximum Locos per Train</strong>
          <input type="text" name="textfield3" id="textfield3">
          <br>
          Now set the maximum number of locomotives that you want the program to  assign to a train. If you don't want the program assigning engines, set  this value to 0.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Switch Time (minutes)</strong>
          <input type="text" name="textfield4" id="textfield4">

          <br>
          The program when generating switch lists for the various locations on  your railroad, will estimate the arrival times for your trains based on  the train's departure time and the switch and travel times. Enter the  average number of minutes it takes to drop or pickup a car on your  railroad. Then enter the average amount of time in minutes it takes to  travel from one location to the another. Later when you create a <strong><a href="Ops_Routes.shtml">route</a></strong><br>
          you will be able to increase or decrease the train's travel time betwee any two locations.<br>
      </p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p><strong>Scale</strong> Next select the scale you are modeling. This is useful when you enter  the length of cars and tracks. You can enter the number of actual inches  and the program will convert to scale feet. Append a double quote to the  length when entering actual inches. The program will also automatically  assign the proper NMRA weight for a car based on scale and length.<br>

        <strong>Car Types</strong>
        <input name="radio" type="radio" id="radio" value="radio" checked>

        <input type="radio" name="radio2" id="radio2" value="radio2">
        <strong>AAR Codes</strong><br>
        The program has two sets of car types for you to use. <strong>Descriptive </strong>provides type names like <strong>Boxcar </strong>and <strong>Tankcar</strong>, and <strong>AAR</strong> provides type  names like <strong>XM</strong> and <strong>T</strong> for boxcars and tank cars respectively. Select  the one that you prefer.</p>
        <p><strong>Optional Year Modeled</strong>
          <input type="text" name="textfield7" id="textfield7">
          <br>
          You can optionally enter the year you want printed on your train manifess.

        <strong>Options</strong><br>
        <input name="checkbox3" type="checkbox" id="checkbox3" checked>
        <strong>Add Operations Menu to Main Menu</strong><br>
        When selected, and saved, the operations menu will be added  to the main menu bar the next time you start JMRI..  To remove it go through  the same procedure&hellip; in the Settings window uncheck the box, &ldquo;Save&rdquo; the change  and restart DecoderPro&reg;. </p>

          When you're finished with the settings window, press the save button to  store the setting in a file called <strong>Operations.xml.</strong> You can find this  file in your JMRI directory in a folder called <strong>operations</strong>. The program  will also create a backup file each time you press the

          <br>

          will store a copy of the operation files in a  new  directory in operations called <strong>backups</strong>, and then stores the operation  files in a directory that is based on the day you created the backup. For example, if today was November 21, 2008, the program will  create a backup directory named <strong>2008_11_21</strong>.<br>
          <br>
          <input type="submit" name="button4" id="button4" value="Restore">
      will prompt you to select which set of backup files you  wish to use to recover your operation files. You must quit and restart  DecoderPro&reg; to complete the restoration of the operation files.</p></td>

        Aggressive<br>
      </strong>There are two build train options, normal and aggressive. Normal is recommended when you are beginning, as Normal builds guarantee that when a car is delivered(set out) by a train that there will be track space available for the car.</p>
      <p>Aggressive builds makes the car's track space available as soon as a car is scheduled for a pickup. </p>
      <p>Note that once you've built a train, the build option can not be changed until all trains are terminated or reset.</p></td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Local Car Movement<br>
        </strong>This set of options controls the local car movements. Normally, it is better not to allow a car to move from one spur directly to another spur in the same location. This type of move is very unrealistic.If you need these types of moves, select the appropriate checkbox.<strong><br>

        <strong>Enable Type, Road and </strong>Load Restrictions into Staging<br>
        This opton restricts trains to staging tracks that only accept the train's rolling stock type, road and load names. This is useful when you want trains delivered to staging tracks based on the train's rolling stock restrictions. However, if you want certan car types, car loads, or road name to be transported by a train, but not delivered to staging, deselect this feature</td>

      <strong>Prompt for Departure Track from Staging<br>
      </strong>If you would like the program to ask you which track a train should depart from staging during the train build, select this option. Normally, during the train build the program would select the least recently used track when determining the track to depart from. Note that the program will only prompt you if there are two or more trains availabe in staging that meet the train's requirements.</td>

        <strong>Enable Car Routing<br>
        </strong>When car routing is enabled, the program will use multiple trains to deliver a car to its final destination.  It is recommended that you leave the option enabled. With car routing enabled, you can use a <strong><a href="Ops_schedule.shtml">Schedule</a></strong> to deliver a car to a specific location.  The car routing algorithm will search for the most efficient rout for the car to travel. The algorithm will try to find a route using a maximum of five trains to complete the car move. Note that the program never gives up trying to route a car. If a car has been assigned a &quot;Final Destination&quot; the program will try and route the car after every move.</p></td>
