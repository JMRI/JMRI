<h4>Formatting the decoder definition</h4>
<p>The easiest way to create a new decoder definition is to edit  one that already exists that has parameters similar to  your new decoder.  Hundreds of decoder definitions are available in JMRI, so you should be able to find one that is similar as a starting point. Don't feel bad about standing on someone  else's shoulders, that's the spirit of JMRI and open source software in  general. Although you can call this new  file anything you like, it will work best if you use the same convention as the  provided files. That is &quot;<strong>manufacturer  name</strong>&quot;_&quot;<strong>decoder family</strong>&quot;.xml, for example: <strong>Digitrax_1x2.xml</strong>  and <strong>Atlas_DualMode.xml</strong>. </p>
<p>Now that you have located a Decoder Definition file as a starting point  open the file with an XML editor 
(editors recommended by jmri are discussed on a  
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/XmlDtdUsage.shtml">separate page)</a>  or your favorite text editor.
<strong>DO NOT</strong> try an advanced word processor like  Word.
Use a basic text file editor like  Notepad, or an XML editor, XML Marker is a good one and it's free.</p>
<p>The beginning XML lines deal with the Header:</p>
<p><strong> Author</strong></p>

<p><strong>Decoder Family and  Model</strong></p>

<p><strong>Programming modes the decoder will accept:</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/Dcode03.png" alt="Programming Modes" width="426" height="62" border="2"></p>
<p>The next part of the file consists of a set of 'variable' elements defining  specific variables, nested inside a 'variables' (note the extra &quot;s&quot;)  element. Here's where the real  definition is determined. </p>
<p>Each variable represents one thing to configure. They can represent a  single CV, e.g. address, or a few bits that can be configured to control a  particular function. If some of these aren't appropriate to your decoder, you  can just remove them. Make sure you remove the entire element from the  <span class="ACCENT">&lt;variable&gt;</span> to the matching <span class="ACCENT">&lt;/variable&gt;</span>. You can also rearrange them  if you'd prefer a different sequence.</p>

  Once you get your variables all in order, it's time to test the definition.</p>
