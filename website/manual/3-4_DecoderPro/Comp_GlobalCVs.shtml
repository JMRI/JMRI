For the hard-core programmer, this pane is a listing of the raw CV
data by CV number, with data in <span class="ACCENT">decimal format</span>.
You may change data by typing new numbers into the <b>Values</b> window.
<b>State</b> shows the validity of the data, whether it was taken <b>From file </b>(the decoder information saved in the <b>Roster</b>), <b>Edited</b>,
<b>Read</b> directly from the decoder, <b>Stored</b> to the decoder or if the status is <b>Unknown</b>. Note the <b>scroll bar</b> on
the right side of the listings. You may scroll up or down to access all
of the CV listings.</p>
<h4>Decoder Locking
</h4>
<p> You tried to read a CV value and  get &ldquo;Error 308, No Acknowledgement from Decoder&rdquo;, well the decoder may be  locked. CV 15 and 16 deal with locking,  if your manufacturer implements this feature (and manufacturers have slight  differences as to how they implement it).  If the decoder is locked, then you will not be able to read data from it  or write to it. To unlock the decoder,  you must enter a value into CV15 (the only CV that can be written when the  decoder is locked), that is equal to the value that is currently in CV16. Now I hear you thinking &ldquo;but I can't read  CV16 to know what to put into CV15&rdquo;.  Well, you'll have to try all possible values, which isn't that hard since it can only have  8 possible values 0 thru 7. After each  write, try to read CV16. It's the  fastest read since it can only have 8 possible values. If JMRI responds with the no-ack error, then  try the next value. If it returns the  value in CV16, you've unlocked the decoder and you're in. If you have unsuccessfully tried all the 8  possibilities, then check your layout connection and the loco's wheels for poor  connections and try again. Now you say, &ldquo;I've  looked thru the list several times and CV 15 doesn't appear&rdquo;. That's on purpose, to minimize inadvertent  locking by a Write All Sheets. You will  have to use the<u> </u><a href="Simple_Programmer.shtml">Single CV Programmer </a>to write CV15. It can be found in the Tools menu on the Main  Page, under Programmers.</p>
<p>If you have more than one decoder in your locomotive, you probably have a decoder locking scheme implemented to be able to access each one individually for programming. There is a <a href="Multi_Decoder_Control.shtml">Multi-decoder control</a> tool in JMRI. It is located on the main window under Tools menu, programmers option. It is accompanied with a comprehensive help describing its use.</p>
<p>
You may <b>Read</b> or <b>Write</b> individual CVs using the buttons
in their row. On this page, a <b>Read sheet</b> or <b>Write sheet</b> operation
is the same as a <b>Read all</b> or <b>Write all</b>. <span class="ACCENT">Again, a reminder: you can only read CVs if your command station has that capability.</span>

<p>
  One thing to keep in mind about the <b>CV</b> listing on this pane - anything you can do here you can do from one of the other panes in DecoderPro, without having to know the <b>CV</b> number or how to compile the values to get the desired effect. This pane is meant for advanced users of DCC used to crunching the numbers themselves. Those new to DCC can safely ignore this panel without losing any capability at all.
