<p>The<strong>Basic Speed Control pane</strong> looks very complicated, but it can be one of
the most significant in improving the performance of your locomotive fleet.
<h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Main.png" width="799" height="402" alt="Speed pane"></h1>

<p>Let's look first at the top of the pane: You now have the option of using Basic Speed Control (this pane) or Speed Table to control your locomotive's speed.  Which ever one you select last and write to your decoder will be the method used for speed control.  To select this pane:
<p>Depending upon the decoder manufacturer, any of these settings could be on this pane.
<p>Capability to select  the <strong>Use Vstart, Vmid, Vhigh</strong> settings..
<p>Three important CVs are programmed in this pane Vstart, Vmid and Vhigh. They work together to make a very basic three point speed table. On some decoders these settings may be labeled differently and all three may not be available. DecoderPro will show the correct options for your selected decoder.
<p>
<b>Vstart</b>(<strong>Start Voltage</strong>) is the voltage at the first speed step. If your locomotive
didn't start moving until there were three volts on the track with analog
power, this lets you set up the decoder to give it 2.99 volts right away,
so it will start moving when you advance the throttle.
<p>
<b>Vhigh(Top Voltage, Max Voltage, Maximum Voltage)</b> is the maximum amount of power the locomotive will
get from the decoder. If your locomotive looks like Chuck Yeager's X-1
at full throttle, then you can trim the top speed down to a more reasonable scale 
level.
<p>
<b>Vmid</b>(<strong>Mid Voltage, Midpoint Voltage) </strong>lets you configure the slope between <b>Vstart</b>
and <b>Vhigh</b> a bit, so that if your locomotive reaches full speed
at 5 volts, you can stretch out the lower end of the curve to get more
fine control in a useful speed range.
<p>If you are having problems with  unpredictable speeds with your locomotives, check these settings. Sometimes, one
or more of these  settings have been changed accidentally (usually due to an error in programming CVs with a throttle), leading to very odd speed performance. In particular, if the <strong>Vmid</strong> is  lower than <strong>Vstart</strong> or higher than <strong>Vhigh</strong>, results can be highly  unpredictable. DecoderPro will not let you make this mistake.
<p><b>Forward Trim</b> and <b>Reverse
    Trim</b> allow you to compensate for differences in the forward speed and reverse speed of the locomotive. Most model locomotives do not run at exactly the
same speed forward and backward due to the motor mechanics and the gear train to the wheels. 
<p>The settings for these controls  are not as intuitive as you might think. A setting of 0 in these CVs turns them
off. However, a setting of 128 in either of them will have no visible effect!  To make the forward and reverse trim
effective, raise the value above 128 to  increase speed, and lower it below 128 to decrease speed in this pane. The Forward and Reverse Trim does not  work the same for all decoders, with variations between manufacturers.</p>

  <h3>Some suggestions on using the basic motor controls and programming on the main.</h3>
  <p> Unless you want to get into some precision speed matching, you probably won't need to use the <b>Speed Tables</b> you'll see on the <a href="Comp_Speed_Talble.shtml" target="_parent"><strong>Speed Table pane</strong></a>- you'll be able to accomplish much of what you want using just <b>Kick start</b> (<a href="Comp_Motor.shtml">previous  pane</a>), and <b>Start Volts</b>, <b>Mid Volts</b>, and <b>Max Volts</b> if  they are available in this pane...  but how to do this?
  <p> Start with the <b>Kick start</b> value, and <a href="Basic_Programming.shtml#OpsMode">Programming on the main</a> rather than the programming track. Set the locomotive to be programmed on throttle step 1. If it moves <span class="ACCENT">at all</span>, don't change the <b>Kick start</b> value. If it doesn't move, slowly step up the throttle until it does. Then, turn the throttle down. If the locomotive stops at the same setting it started, you won't need to set the <b>Kick start</b> value. However, if it continues to run at a slower speed than it would start, then increase the <b>Kick start</b> value until it will start and run at its slowest possible speed.
  <p> Now, if the locomotive isn't running at throttle step 1, increase the <b>Start Volts</b> value (and  write it) without changing the throttle until the locomotive <span class="ACCENT">barely</span> crawls... you can usually get this down to a speed of a tie a minute or so if you like! Remember, you are doing this in "<b>ops mode</b>",  so you can make these changes while the locomotive is actually running. Don't forget to write the value changes to the decoder - they won't take effect unless you do.
  <p> Now, set the top speed of the locomotive. Run the throttle up to full, and lower the <b>Max Volts</b> value (and  write it) until the locomotive runs at the maximum speed you want it to reach, but don't forget that adding a train will slow it down!
  <p> Finally, set the <b>Mid Volts</b> value about half-way between <b>Start Volts</b> and <b>Max Volts</b>. Setting it above or below the median of the <b>Start Volts</b> and <b>Max Volts</b> values will give you a crude, three point speed table.
  <p>There are no hard and fast rules for the exact numbers to use. Even identical locomotives with identical decoders will need different numbers, due to variances in motors and drive trains. Experiment with the settings - DecoderPro makes it easy!
  <p>Note: Not all decoders will have Start, Mid and Max Volts, but will have some version of this which will be displayed by DecoderPro for the specific decoder.
