<hr>
<p>Opens a Windows <strong>Open</strong> dialog box to allow you to select the file of your choice and a file that meets the criteria defined herein.  Note that the program will only add  cars that don't exist in the program's car roster. It the car already  exists, the import will be skipped by the program. You must also create  the locations and their tracks before importing the cars into the  operations program.</p>
<p>To improve the speed of the car import, you can close the <strong>Cars</strong> window. It takes significantly more processor cycles to update the cars  panel than to actually import the cars. </p>
<p>After importing your cars, you must save them if you want to keep  them as part of your roster. Select any car by pressing the edit button  and then press the 
  <input type="submit" name="button" id="button" value="Save">
that can be found at the bottom right  of the <strong>Edit Car</strong> window. </p>
<p>If you already have a list of cars in a database, you can import the  cars into the program. The import function requires an ACSII text file,  with one line for each car. The import order is car number, car road  name, car type, car length, car weight, car color. The following shows  two examples of the correct format: </p>
<p>336 GCR Flat 40 3.8 Black <br>
655578 UP Boxcar 40 3.8 Yellow</p>
<p>Each line can start with a space and multiple spaces between  fields is okay. Optionally you can include additional information in the  following order, owner name, date built, and location. The location can  have two fields, the location name followed by the location's siding or  yard name separated by a hyphen. The following shows two examples of the  correct format:</p>
<br>
336 GCR Flat 40 3.8 Black AT 1930 Home Town USA - George's Oil Terminal <br>
655578 UP Boxcar 40 3.8 Yellow DB 1934 York - York Freight
<p>If you prefer to use comma delimiters instead of spaces, place  the word "comma" at the start of your import file and use commas instead  of spaces. The following are two examples of importing cars with comma  deliminters.</p>
<p>comma <br>
  336,GCR,Flat Car,40,3.8,Black,AT,1930,Home Town USA,-,George's Oil  Terminal <br>
  655578,UP,Tank Car,40,3.8,Yellow,DB,1934,York,-,York Freight</p>
<p>You need to be very careful with spaces when importing a comma  delimitated file. The program will include leading and trailing spaces  if they exist between the commas.</p>
