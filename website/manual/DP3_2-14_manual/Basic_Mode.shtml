<p>Some brief comments on Programming Modes </p>
<p><strong>Address Mode</strong> is an outdated programming method that is  included here for the sake of <br>
full compliance with the NMRA DCC standard.</p>
<p><strong>Register Mode</strong> is an expanded form of 
Address Mode, and is still used by some older and/or  lower end decoders, particularly some from MRC and Wangrow. It is inherently limited in its  ability to access all CVs in a decoder. </p>
<p><strong>Paged Mode </strong>is an expansion of Register mode that gives  full access to all decoder CVs. </p>
<p><strong>Direct Mode</strong> is another method, not yet  supported by all decoders, that allows full access. There  are two ways of implementing Direct Mode. The radio button(s) for the Direct Mode method(s) your command station supports  will be activated. </p>
<p>  If you experience difficulty programming a decoder in  Paged Mode, try Direct Mode, then <br>
  Register Mode, and finally Address Mode. The EasyDCC AD4  Accessory Decoder can only be <br>
programmed in Direct Mode.</p>
