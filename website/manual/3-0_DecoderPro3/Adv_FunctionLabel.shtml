<hr>
<p>This pane is opened from the <strong>Labels &amp; Media</strong> button the DecoderPro3 main window or from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu.</p>
<p><img src="images/Adv_03_FunctionLabels.png" width="800" height="693" alt="Function Label pane"></p>
<p>This  pane is more than a scratch pad to keep track of what happens when function  buttons are pushed. It also interacts  with the <a href="Main_Throttle.shtml">JMRI throttle</a>.
<p>The <strong>Function Label</strong>s Tab makes settings for the Software Throttles within JMRI.  Primarily the on-screen throttles, but some of the settings are mirrored on smart-phones (iPhone/Android) using the WiThrottle interface.</p>
<p>When you  use the roster pull-down on the JMRI throttle to select a loco from your  roster, the function buttons will be marked with the descriptions you have  entered for those functions in this pane. </p>
<p>In this example, the Function keys on the Throttle will be labeled for the FP-45 with Tsunami OEM Sound decoder with sounds and lighting functions.</p>
<p><img src="images/Adv_03_FunctionOnThrottle.png" width="531" height="523" alt="throttle functiosn">
<p>Using the checkboxes,	space holders and the radio button to the right of each function may be set to:
<table width="80%" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td width="13%"><strong>lock</strong></td>
    <td width="87%"><p>Makes the function button &quot;latching&quot; or &quot;non-latching&quot;. When the box is checked the function is &quot;locked&quot; or &quot;latched&quot;.</p>
    <p><strong>Latched Function </strong>when pressed  will stay on(down position) until pressed again i.e. Function button labeled &quot;Bell&quot; would ring until pressed again.</p>
    <p><strong>Unlatched Function </strong>when pressed toggles on and then off. i.e. Function Button labled &quot;short horn&quot;, when pressed provides one blast of horn.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>off</strong></td>
    <td>Place holder for icon that is displayed on Function Button when it is in off state.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>on</strong></td>
    <td>Place holder for icon that is displayed on Function Button when it is in on state.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>shunt</strong></td>
    <td>Sets &quot;virtual&quot; funtion key for software throttle. The &quot;lock&quot; option also needs to be set simultaneously with the &quot;shunt&quot; virtual function key activation. When this Function key is pressed the throttle speed slider on the software throttle changes to &quot;center off&quot; style for shunting, rather than the &quot;full-range with separate direction key&quot;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>You may drag and drop icons into the off or on space holder here or in the Throttle Function pane properties.
<p>You  may also edit the function button text in the <strong><a href="dp3_Main_Throttle.shtml">JMRI Throttle</a></strong> and save those changes to the selected Roster entry. To use these changed entries in the future, make  sure you click on the
  <input type="submit" name="button" id="button" value="Save to Roster"> 
  to save these values into the Roster entry that is in use.
