<p>Many PanelPro users have each come up with their own PanelPro application, ranging from simple to complex: </p>

<h3>Modular Signals in the UK</h3>

The Essex Belt Lines group is using JMRI to add signalling, including CTC,
to their large modular layouts.
There was a

in the Fall 2016 issue of the

<h3>Cashaway Valley Railroad</h3>

Jim Thompson is using PanelPro to make a dispatcher's panel for his Cashaway Valley Railroad</a>.
Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oke5ea869FY">YouTube Video</a>.

<h3>Cornwall RR</h3>
Well over a decade ago, Nick Kulp already created a program to drive his
<a href="Panels-Cornwall/Cornwall.shtml">Cornwall RR</a>

<h3>Quaker Valley</h3>

Bob Bucklew built a realistic CTC panel for his
Quaker Valley Railroad.
He's created a very nice series of web pages on
<a href="http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/QV_CTCnew.html">how it's done</a>.

<h3>Bloomfield &amp; Oakland RR</h3>

Alan Huberty created a multi-screen control panel for his Bloomfield &amp; Oakland Railroad.

<h3>Shasta Route</h3>

<p>The goal of Otis McGee's
<a href="http://www.spshastaroute.org/">SP Shasta Route</a>
is prototypical fidelity to 1952 operations.
At the time, the railroad was run from a CTC machine at the dispatcher's office in
Dunsmuir, CA (see photo to right).
To recreate that, Otis has installed a rebuilt United Switch and Signal CTC machine
on his railroad (see below).
<a href="SPShasta.shtml">PanelPro controls the machine and provides CTC control</a> for the layout
via a large seven-node C/MRI installation.</p>

<h3>Durenver &amp; Silverton RR</h3>
	<p>Egbert Broerse's <a href="http://www.ebroerse.nl/railroading.html#dcc">Durenver &amp; Silverton Railroad</a>
    panel was made using Panel Editor and is displayed on a compact LCD monitor by <a href=
    "http://jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/PanelPro/index.shtml">JMRI PanelPro 2.4.1</a> on OSX 10.4.6,
    the last version supported by the MacMini hardware.The graphics on the panel match a generic (US-built)
    Entrance-Exit (NX) CTC machine, in use from 1950 until the mid nineties. However, most turnouts are
    operated with an Individual Function Switch (IFS); see the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_control">Signaling Wiki</a>.</p>

The NX CTC machine in Eindhoven, The Netherlands (photo &copy; <a
            href="http://www.nicospilt.com/index_seinhuizen.htm">Nico Spilt</a>)
<p>Egbert started by drawing a compact track schematic in 4 pt white lines on a black background.
Location names and block boundaries were added to help in the orientation of the dispatcher.
Icons from the Small LED schematics group were added to show track occupancy and Medium LED
icons display and control the current state of lighting etc. Turnouts in hidden trackage are
monitored using Infrared detectors, shown on the panel, supported bij audio signals produced by JMRI.
Later, signals were added on the layout as well as to the panel (below, center). All logic is controlled as Signal
Mast Logic following a customized <a href=
"http://jmri.org/xml/signals/RG-1965/index.shtml">Rio Grande 1965 Rule Book</a> signal definition.
Physical control panels on the layout fascia sport the same graphic style, be it black on yellow

<h3>Czechoslovak State Railways &ndash; Elektrosignal Praga</h3>

<p>Electromechanical interlocking equipment
    <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektromechanisches_Stellwerk">wikipedia</a>
    is widely used in Europe and North America.
    The Siemens &amp; Halske 1912 model was first put into operation in 1894 in Prerau
    at The Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway
    in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now P&#345;erov in the Czech Republic).
    In later years, this device was manufactured by more than one company.

<h3>Czechoslovak State Railways &ndash; A&#381;D-71</h3>

<p>A&#381;D-71 is relay interlocking system produced by Automatizace &#382;elezni&#269;n&#237; 
    dopravy Praha &ndash; A&#381;D. It was developed in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. 
    The A&#381;D-71 system was deployed from 1970 to 1996 as the main relay 
    interlocking system in the  network Czechoslovak State Railways &ndash; &#268;SD.

<h3>Czechoslovak State Railways &ndash; JOP</h3>

<p>JOP &ndash; Jednotn&#233; Obslu&#158;n&#233; Pracovi&#353;t&#283; &ndash; Unified Control Place 
    &ndash; is a standardized user interface for interlocking systems used in Czechoslovakia. 
    For first time it was used in station D&#345;&#237;sy in 1991. Currently, 
    the JOP user interface is standardized and used with interlocking systems 
    from various manufacturers such as A&#381;D Praha, AK signal Brno 
    or STARMON Choce&#328;.
</p>

<p>JMRI provides a JOP style look for Czechoslovak State Railways &ndash; &#268;SD and 
   his successors. Tutorial for Control Panel Editor and Warrants with JOP is here

<h3>Crandic Dispatcher</h3>

The Cedar River and Iowa Central Railway (Crandic) has
a great
<a href="http://www.danook.com/crandic/ ">"Dispatching on the Crandic"</a>
video, along with several others, available
for download. The Crandic's control program and dispatcher panel
called
<a href="http://cats4ctc.org"><!-- was http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/ --> CATS</a>
was built by Rodney Black on
top of the JMRI libraries. He's kindly made it available as
open-source software to anybody who wants to use it.

<h3>Fall River Division</h3>
CATS is also used on John Parker's
<a href="http://www.bnsfrr.net/">BNSF Fall River Division</a>
for their
<a href="http://www.bnsfrr.net/operations.html">dispatcher's panel</a>.

<h3>Model Railroad Manager</h3>

The
<a href="http://www.modelrailroadmanager.com">Model Railroad Manager</a>
software provides inventory, operations, maintenance and layout control
programs for model railroads.  The layout-related parts are
<a href="http://www.modelrailroadmanager.com/MRRM_Advanced_Edition/Software_Architecture.html">based on the JMRI libraries</a>.
