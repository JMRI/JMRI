	    <h1>JMRI: PanelPro on the SP Shasta Route</h1>

<p>This page describes how PanelPro is used to control 
	<a href="http://www.spshastaroute.org/">Otis McGee's SP Shasta Route</a> layout.</p>
<h3>The Layout</h3>
<p>The SP Shasta Route layout is a model of the Southern Pacific's
Shasta Division, Black Butte Subdivision in 1952. There's 
an extensive <a href="http://spshastaroute.org/">web site</a> describing it.
</p>

</a>

<p>Otis's main goal is operations with prototypical fidelity. 
In 1952, the prototype was a mix of CTC signaling on the 
lower (western) half of this division, and timetable-and-train-order on the 
upper (eastern) half. The layout is meant to reproduce this as closely as possible.</p>

<p>Eventually, Otis wanted to reproduce the dispatcher's experience with
an operating CTC machine.  In 1952, a large CTC machine was
installed at the Dunsmuir station, part of the modelled portion of the railroad
(see prototype photo to the right).
Otis was not interested in computer-based control panels, even as a temporary measure.</p>

<h3>Initial Stage: ABS Signaling</h3>
<p>The first project was to introduce ABS signaling. This would
let us install and operate signals on the layout, and use them for
	collision avoidance during the initial operating sessions.</p>

<a href="http://spshastaroute.org/e/4.jpg">

</a>

	<p>After some research, Otis decided to use C/MRI for layout control,
and NCE DCC to operate the trains.  C/MRI was well suited because
the layout is large, but there are a large number of control points
(inputs and outputs) 
needed at specific points like the CTC machine, staging and operational
yards, etc.  
The C/MRI SUSIC and SMINI units were well suited in size to these I/O requirements.</p>
<p>
All turnouts on the layout are operated by Tortoise slow-motion switch motors,
operated through C/MRI Switch Motor Controller (SMC) boards and
slide switches on the facia (this method was originally
perfected on 
<a href="http://www.lwmweb.com/sw&sf/">Rick Fortin's Sierra Western & Santa Fe Railroad</a>.)
Locally operated turnouts have the slide switch directly
connected to the SMC board, operating the turnout without
	going through the computer.</p>

<a href="http://spshastaroute.org/e/12.jpg">

</a>

	<p>Mainline turnouts are controlled through PanelPro, because it needs
to know their position for operating the signals, and because once
the CTC machine is installed, the turnouts will be controlled from
both the fascia and the CTC machine.  To do this, the toggle switch
is connected to a C/MRI input, and the SMC is connected to a C/MRI
output.  A JMRI
<a href="/help/en/html/tools/Routes.shtml">Route</a>
		is then used to operate the turnout when the slide switch changes.</p>
<p>
This works very well when the program is running, but does an 
unfortunate thing when the C/MRI system is first turned on.
When power is first applied to the C/MRI system, before the computer
has had a chance to initialize it, the outputs go to random
states (the SP Shasta C/MRI system mostly has them inactive, but
there are a couple that go active).  This causes the switch machines
to move to random locations, with no regard to the position set by
the fascia slide switches.  This can throw turnouts under
parked trains, etc.  
To help this, we start PanelPro before powering up the 
C/MRI system, so that the program will rapidly set the outputs
once the C/MRI turns on.  Combined with the slow speed of the 
	Tortoise machines, the turnouts only move a little way.</p>
<p>
We're considering a more elegant situation, where power to the
SMC boards is interrupted by a relay until the computer has
been able to communicate enough with the C/MRI system to switch
a specific output. Since the SMC machines won't have 
power, they won't be able to move the Tortoises until they are 
	under positive control.</p>

<p>PanelPro legacy 
"<a href="/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/blockboss/BlockBossFrame.shtml">Simple Signaling Logic</a>"
is used to operate each signal.  Note that this is entirely
"behind the scenes"; there's no control panel on the computer, 
and the dispatcher has no way to set the signals.  Instead, they
just respond to how turnouts are set and where trains are present,
	essentially just warning train engineers of unsafe conditions ahead.</p>

<p>Also during this stage, JMRI scripting was used to control a 
large turntable and roundhouse complex at the Dunsmuir yard.
Since every locomotive on the layout is highly detailed and has sound, 
Otis wanted
to turn off power to roundhouse tracks that are not currently
aligned with the turntable.
This greatly reduces the sound volume in the engine terminal, and makes 
it much harder to accidentally drive a locomotive into the turntable pit.
A pair of scripts were used to watch the turnout operation, and
turn on and off appropriate channels in C/MRI relay cards to control
track power in the area.  This is an interesting combination of DCC and C/MRI power control!</p>

<h3>Second Stage: The CTC Machine</h3>

<p>While the signaling phase was going on, Otis 
commissioned Rod Loder to build a 
<a href="http://spshastaroute.org/ctc.html">CTC machine</a>.  
Rod does excellent work, using
prototypical techniques and original components to
the greatest extent possible. The photo's below show 
Rod delivering it, the original switches and indicators on the back of
the panel, the beginning of the roughly one thousand connections needed
to the C/MRI system, and the final panel with the 
	first few indicators lit.</p>

<p>
PanelPro is providing USS signal logic to drive the panel, and this
CTC panel is providing an excellent test-bed for that logic.  They're
	evolving together.</p>

<h3>Third Stage: Automated Staging Assistance</h3>
<a href="http://spshastaroute.org/e/15.jpg">
<img src="http://spshastaroute.org/e/thumb_15_jpg.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" ALIGN="RIGHT"></a>

Although we've not started on this yet, 
in the long run we'd like to have PanelPro
provide assistance for the staging operations.
The railroad has two loop staging yards, 
a single-ended yard, and a large double-track
helix connecting the ends of the layout that also serves as
staging. PanelPro is already operating the 
throats for these yards from physical control panels:  When a button 
is pushed to select a particular track, the program aligns the
throat turnouts and orients the power for entrance or exit in the loops.
It also reads the track occupancy status and lights indicators on
the panels to show which tracks are occupied.  All of this is
done with a total of about 48 JMRI
<a href="/help/en/html/tools/Routes.shtml">Routes</a>.

<p>
The next step, which we probably won't work on until
after the CTC machine is completely operational,
is to add controls so the computer can help with staging operations.
The idea is that a train crew will bring their train to the 
appropriate end point, tell the local operator that they've
finished their run, and then the operator will 
have the computer run the train into staging while the crew goes off to their
next assignment.  This removes the unprototypical part of staging
from the crew's experience, without adding too much 
unprototypical workload to the operator.</p>
