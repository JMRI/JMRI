<h1>Using JMRI and XTrackCAD Together</h1>

<img src="../../../images/xtracadreader.png" width="147" height="53" alt="XTrackCad and JMRI" align="right">
XtrkCadReader is a java tool that can take a layout file created with the
<a href="http://xtrkcad-fork.sourceforge.net/Wikka/HomePage">XTrackCAD layout design and simulation program</a>
and convert it to a Layout Editor .xml panel file JMRI can use.

<p>
It can be downloaded from the
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/XTrkCadReader/releases">Releases page</a> on GitHub.
<br>
A <a href="XtrkCadReader.pdf">Manual (PDF)</a> describing how to run XtrkCadReader from the terminal,
including the options and limitations, is included in the download together with several example files.
<span class="since">Since XtrkCadReader 2.2.2</span>

<p>
When you design a layout with XTrackCAD, the information about track, turnouts,
and their connections is stored in a ".xtc" file.
When you run XtrkCadReader with an XTC file as input, it creates
an "XML" file for JMRI that contains the corresponding information.<br>
You can then read that XML file into JMRI PanelPro to create a
<a href="../../../help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor</a> panel
that represents your trackwork.

<p>
XtrkCadReader was created by Giorgio Terdina from 2008. It was updated since by JMRI team members.<br>
Release 2.2.2 works with both JMRI 4.12 and XTrackCAD 5.1.1.<br>
Release 2.2.3 will also read XTrackCAD 5.2 files.<br>
Release 2.2.4 added the capability to import Bezier tracks.<span class="since">Since XtrkCadReader 2.2.4</span></p>
