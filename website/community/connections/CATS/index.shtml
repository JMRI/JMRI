The Crandic Automated Traffic System (CATS) is a JMRI-based application by 
Rodney Black for controlling and operating a model railroad. 
There's more information on the 
<a href="http://cats4ctc.org"><!-- was http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/ --> CATS web site</a>.

<h3>Technical Info</h3>

JMRI is a library, and CATS is a large, separately maintained application
that uses the library.  As such, CATS provides an important 
reference case for JMRI developers as they extend and adapt their code.
CATS should continue to work for it's users, with a minimum of extranous
effort for the CATS developers!

<p>A
<a href="/help/en/html/doc/Technical/CATS.shtml">separate page</a>
describes how JMRI and CATS are connected, and 
how the JMRI developers check that their changes 
don't inadvertantly cause problems for CATS.
