    <h1>JMRI: Applications That Connect with JMRI...</h1>

    <p>
       Hobbyists have created applications that work with JMRI to provide extra capabilities.
       Many of them are listed here with links to their external web sites and further information on how to use them with JMRI.
       [Information is believed to be correct as of time of last update.  Please report any changes or additions so JMRI community members
       may make updates.]
    </p>

       <dd>Written by Tim Mann,
        Model Railroad Switch List and Manifest Formatter (MR SLAM Formatter)
        reads in a JMRI created manifest or switch list CSV file,
        formats the data according to the user's settings,
        and then writes the manifest or switch list to a PDF file.
        The PDF may be printed directly from the program
        or opened for viewing with Adobe's free program Acrobat Reader.
        MR SLAM Formatter offers numerous options to customize your manifests and switch lists.
        MR SLAM Formatter runs under both Windows 10 and Mac OS X 10.15
        and is available as a free download from
