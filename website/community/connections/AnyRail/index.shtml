    <p>The <a href="http://www.anyrail.com" target="_blank">AnyRail layout planning software</a>
    can now export a layout design as a JMRI panel file that can be loaded by PanelPro.
    See the <a href="https://www.anyrail.com/help_en/index.html" target="_blank">AnyRail documentation</a>.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p> The AnyRail software should be the latest version.  Version 6.29 added support for exporting
    AnyRail designs that use flex track.</p>
    <p>JMRI 4.18 or later (4.20 recommended) with at least Java 8.  See <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/setup">
    JMRI Setup</a> for new installs.</p>
    <p>For people new to JMRI, or new to PanelPro and Layout Editor,
    do   the <a href= "https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/PanelPro/GettingStarted.shtml">
    Getting Started with PanelPro</a> tutorial.</p>

    <h2>Create the AnyRail design</h2>
    <p>Create the layout design using the AnyRail tools</p>
    <p>Use the Label feature to assign names to turnouts because those labels will be used as User Names in JMRI which 
    will be easier to understand than the automatically generated names. 
    Also, if Blocks will be used in PanelPro, use the Label feature to assign names to sections because those labels will 
    be used as Block User Names in JMRI.</p>

    <h2>Export the AnyRail design as a JMRI PanelPro file</h2>
      <h3>JMRI</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Start PanelPro.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>Help &rArr; Locations</strong> from the PanelPro menu.</li>
        <li>The <strong>User Files Location</strong> entry will be used during the AnyRail export. Make a note of it.</li>
        <li>If desired, click on the <strong>Open User Files Location</strong> button.
        This will open the operating system file manager at that location.</li>
        <li>Quit PanelPro.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>AnyRail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>If necessary, start AnyRail and open the layout design file.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>File &rArr; Export as</strong>; select <strong>JMRI Layout file</strong>.</li>
        <li>In the <strong>Save as</strong> dialog, navigate to the <strong>user files location</strong>
        noted earlier. The exported file name will default to the AnyRail file name with
        <strong>.xml</strong> replacing <strong>.any</strong>, but the name can be changed to something more
	descriptive if desired.</li>
        <li>Click on <strong>Save</strong>.  Two files will be created:
          <ul>
            <li>The PanelPro file which contains a <strong>Layout Editor</strong> panel
            and the related tables.</li>
            <li>A jpg image of the AnyRail layout design (including the background and scenery).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Using the exported PanelPro file</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Start PanelPro. Unless specifically desired, it is best to not load any other Panels in PanelPro when
	loading an AnyRail export file.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>Help &rArr; System Console...</strong> from the PanelPro menu.
        This may be important for the first load of the exported PanelPro file to see any errors when loading.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>Panels &rArr; Load Panels...</strong> from the PanelPro menu.</li>
        <li>In the <strong>Load Panel File</strong> dialog, select the exported panel
        name and click on <strong>Load</strong>.</li>
        <li>Review the system console for warnings or errors during the load step.  If errors
        or warnings have occurred and they don't have any meaning (to you), use the <strong>Copy to clipboard</strong>
        button and paste the clipboard contents into a message to the JMRI User Group.</li>
        <li>The following content is now available in PanelPro:
          <ul>
            <li>The Layout Editor panel:  It is displayed in Edit mode to facilitate
            post import modifications.  See
            <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">
            Layout Editor Help</a> for details on using Layout Editor.</li>
            <li>The exported jpg image file is loaded with the xml file and acts as a background
            for the track plan.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Turnout</strong> table:  <strong>Tools &rArr; Tables &rArr; Turnouts</strong> will
            have the list of turnouts.  If labels had been assigned to the turnouts in AnyRail they
            will be used for the <strong>user name</strong>.  If not, a cryptic user name will be
            assigned.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Block</strong> table:  <strong>Tools &rArr; Tables &rArr; Blocks</strong> will
            have the list of blocks.  The AnyRail <strong>Sections</strong> are exported as JMRI <strong>Blocks</strong>.
            If labels have been assigned to the AnyRail Sections they
            will be used for the <strong>user name</strong>.  If not, a cryptic user name will be
            assigned.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If changes have been made to the imported file, store the changes using <strong>File &rArr;
        Store Panels...</strong> in Layout Editor or <strong>Panels &rArr; Store Panels...</strong>
        using the main PanelPro menu. Whether to replace the existing file or use a new file name
        depends on personal file management philosophy.  If <strong>Overwrite</strong> is selected, the old file
        will be moved to the <strong>backupPanels</strong> directory with the date and time added to the file name.</li>
      </ol>



    <h2>Additional notes for using AnyRail's export files</h2>

      <h3>Missing jpg image file</h3>
        <p>If the exported PanelPro file and its related jpg file are manually moved to a different
        location (or if exported to a different location than the <strong>User Files Location</strong>), the jpg image
	will not be found during the first PanelPro load.
        A <strong>Icon Not Found</strong> dialog will be displayed.  There are two optons:
        <ul>
          <li>Either type the correct location of the jpg file in the location field and click on
          <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>
          <li>Or click on <strong>Delete</strong> or <strong>Ignore Errors</strong> to skip loading
          the jpg image.  When the PanelPro file is stored, the reference to the jpg will be removed.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Other errors or unexpected results</h3>
        <p>Use the system console, <strong>Help &rArr; System Console...</strong>, to open a window
        that has details on JMRI and can contain warnings and errors.
