<p>Java must be loaded on your system as well. The program can be gotten
free of charge via download from:</p>
     
<p>"Standard Edition": Try starting at this page:
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html</a></p>
     
<p>Once the program is loaded on your system, you can install the JMRIDEMO
 program and run it.</p>

<h3>Step 1.</h3>
<p>Now, let's get started on the real subject of this clinic, creating a
panel.</p>
     
<p>Some of the first things you might have done before you attempt to build
 a control panel might be, drawing a linear drawing of your layout to represent
 a point-to-point system. Your layout might be a simple loop of track with
 one passing siding but a prototype panel represents miles and miles of a
railroad. Your panel should represent your railroad in this manner. That
is not to say that you cannot draw a loop of track with a passing siding
as the background but that would cut down on your space available for levers,
signals, and status lights in the lower section. Use that sketch and create
a background image that will be used to place all of the icons on the dispatchers
panel.</p>
     
<p>For my panel I used a drawing program call Paint Shop Pro. I created a
 simple Black "track" area on the upper portion of the graphic, and an Olive
 green area to place the control levers and indicator lights. The black area
 will have a 3 pixel wide line that will represent the tracks under the dispatchers
 control, including any switches, signals, and occupancy detectors. You would
 draw the simple schematic representing this track and the other items will
 be added on top of your background. There are a ton of icons included in
the resources\icons folder and you can use your painting program to create
any custom icons you might want. I created some PRR position lights for my
use with Bob Jacobsens help.</p>
     
<p>Now open PanelPro from your start menu. After the program finishes
 loading you will see this menu screen:</p>
     
<p><img src="Image1.gif" width="390" height="200"></p>

<h3>Step 2.</h3>
<p>Set up you preferences for how the program will
 talk to your layout connection. For the purposes of this clinic, I will
use  a Digitrax Loconet connection on Com2 via a Locobuffer II donated by
Dick  Bronson (<a href="http://www.rr-cirkits.com/">www.rr-cirkits.com</a>) at 56,000
baud. Select one of the menu choices that works for your layout. If you do
not have a layout yet or are using this to help your design, you can select
the Loconet Hexfile as your layout connection. It will permit you to see
all of the pieces function as if you were connected to a layout.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image2.gif" width="385" height="193">
  </p>
     
<p><img src="Image3.gif" width="396" height="548">
  </p>

<h3>Step 3.</h3>
<p>SAVE your settings. The program will shut down at that time and
 you will have to reopen it.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image4.gif" width="332" height="282">
  </p>

<h3>Step 4.</h3>
<p>Select the new panel option from the panel menu.</p>

<p><img src="Image5.gif" width="388" height="196">
  </p>
     

<p>	A panel editor will open up. You will use this for almost all of your
 operations in building the panel. Note that the "panel frame to the left
is blank. This is where the next step comes in.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image6.gif" width="568" height="457">
  </p>

<h3>Step 5.</h3>
<p>Select a background for your panel.</p>
     
<p>Select the "Pick background image..." button and a menu will appear. This
 is where you choose that graphic background that you spent weeks creating.
 Now you have to remember where in the heck you saved it to on your hard
drive.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image7.gif" width="576" height="345">
  </p>
     
<p>It can be as complex as you want. It is your railroad. The graphic above
 is from my Cornwall Railroad. As you can see Ive added location names,
block  gaps, and switch numbers on the graphic. I have tried to make the
panel as  self-explanatory as possible since I have several different dispatchers
that  visit my railroad for op sessions. It looks kind of plain right now
but when  it has all of the signals, Detector indicators, switches, levers,
and panel  lights, it will fill out. I imagine when Digitrax has its transponding
completed,  it will be possible to actually track (no pun intended) a train
by its transponder.  This is what it looks like for m dispatcher during
an op session.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image26.gif" width="571" height="343">
  </p>
     
<p><img src="Image27.gif" width="569" height="240">
  </p>
     
<p>This panel is the one Ill be using for the clinic. It is very simple
but it will be able to show how each piece of this puzzle will be used to
build a panel. </p>

<h3>Step 6.</h3>
<p>Create the tables for sensors, switches, and signals.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image9.gif" width="394" height="360">
  </p>
     
<p>Use the tools from this menu to build all of the tables that you will
use to identify all of the components that will "talk" to the layout control
network, i.e. Loconet.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image10.gif" width="276" height="265">
  </p>
     
<p>PanelPro has a structured naming convention that identifies the different
 components. For example, a sensor that talks to loconet would start with
the letter "L". A Loconet Sensor would then be LS and the number that you
have given it by connecting it to the Loconet device like the SE8c. The SE8c
44 pin connector has 8 detector connections. They are identified by DS1 through
 DS8. If you want the detector to be detector number 1, you would wire the
 detectors output to the DS1 connection. The BDL16 uses the same convention
 so if you are using the BDL16, the manual will identify where you would
connect these connections.</p>

<p><img src="Image11.gif" width="571" height="396">
  </p>
     
<p>The green LED on the top section is identified as LS3, Loconet-Sensor
3 and its user name is Mainline. After you create a sensor in the sensor
table you must then choose an icon from the available icons that come with
the program to represent that sensor. Keep in mind that a sensor will have
more than one state. You select this from the panel editor.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image12.gif" width="576" height="432">
  Please note the highlighted selection called "panel items
 can be repositioned" has its check box selected. If you fail to do this,
 your icons will appear at the coordinates in the </p>
     
<p>x-y coordinates at the top of the panel and you will
 not be able to place them where you want them.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image13.gif" width="252" height="440">
  </p>
     
<p>To edit the icons find one that suits your needs from the selections like
 the ones above and select it. Then click on the icon you want it to represent
 and it will replace the default in the boxes at the top. You will see what
 it looks like. Make a selection for all of the icons in this menu and they
 will remain your selections as long as you have the program running. When
 you shut the program down, AFTER YOU HAVE SAVED YOUR PANEL !! the next time
 you open it, the icons will have reverted back to the program defaults shown
 here. There are signals for searchlights, sensors, track pieces and more.
 If what is here doesnt meet your needs, create some with that paint program
 you used to make you background image. From this point on, the process is
 simply a matter of repetition. After the sensors are added, test them on
the panel. If they change, you can see the change in the related table. Once
you have seen them change on the screen, you can test them by connecting
the computer to you layouts interface and running a train. When the train
crosses over the detector section, the indicator should change on the screen.
There is nothing in the world like the first test of this program and having
it work.</p>
     
<p><font color="#ff0000">Note: If you have
 been using a loconet hexfile up to this point, dont forget to edit your
preferences to what you are actually using as your interface. If you forget
to do this, the panel will not see the layout and you might spend hours trying
    to trouble-shoot wiring problems that dont exist (Don't Ask !!)</font></p>
     
<p>After you have populated you panel with the sensors,
 it is time to add the switches to the panel. This is a multi-part process.
 You have already created the turnout table and created your turnouts, now
 you will choose the icons to add to the panel. </p>
     
<p>On a side note, with Digitrax loconet, creating the
sensor and switch tables can be done "magically" by simply running a train
on the layout with PanelPro running and the proper hardware connections made.
As the train progresses over the layout, the feedback into the loconet is
read by PanelPro and since the components are wired to specific terminals
on you Loconet devices, they will send out Loconet messages from those devices.
If a device is not in one of the tables, PanelPro will automatically create
it in the appropriate table. At that point the objects are ready to be used
by PanelPro.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image15.gif" width="316" height="162"></p>
     
<p>Although PanelPro will create the table entries, you must add the user
 names yourself.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image16.gif" width="204" height="172">
  </p>
     
<p>As shown here, LT1 is in place and can be identified by "hovering" the
 mouse over the location after you have placed the switch. The next image
shows all of the icons associated with Switch 1 or the West Crossover. On
the top is the track diagram icon. The icon lays over the three pixel line
you drew for your track schematic. </p>
     
<p>When you chose the icon it looked like this.</p>
   
<p>This is the TurnoutThrownR <img
 src="Image18.gif" width="20" height="20">
  icon in the cornwall icons
folder.<br>
There are also TurnoutClosedR,
 <img src="Image19.gif" width="20"
 height="20">
  <br>
and TurnoutNeitherR  <img
 src="Image17.gif" width="20" height="20">
 icons that represent all of the icons for a right switch.
  </p>
   
<p>There are also icons for Left switches in that folder.
 When the finished panel loads, it doesnt know the status of the switch
and  it will show the Neither until the switch is thrown or feedback is read
from  the controlling device.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image20.gif" width="87" height="304"></p>
     
<p>Next is the switch Lever. These icons are found in the 
CTCPlates folder and are identified as:<br>
  <br>
  PlateSwitchN, <br>
 <img src="plateSwitchN.gif" alt="" width="60" height="60">
<br>
  PlateSwitchR,<br>
  <img src="plateSwitchR.gif" alt="" width="60" height="60">
<br>
  or PlateSwitch.<br>
  <img src="plateSwitch.gif" alt="" width="60" height="60">
<br>
  </p>
   
<p>You must edit the icons and replace the track sections 
with these before you can add them to the panel. When they are selected, they
will act in sync with the track pieces and they will "change" to reflect the
track status.</p>
 
<p>On my panels, I also added position indication LEDs from
the small schematics folder. <img
 src="red.gif" alt="" width="10"
 height="10">
 <img
 src="green.gif" alt="" width="10"
 height="10">
 <img
 src="yellow.gif" alt="" width="10"
 height="10">
 <img src="gray.gif" alt="" width="10"
 height="10">
</p>
 
<p> These are selected exactly like the track sections and
the levers. The way to make them change color is to edit the icons and select
a color for the position that is "active" and the gray one that is not. Add
it to the panel and re-edit the icons to select the other state as a different
color and the reverse state as gray. The LEDs will appear to "light" and
go dark as the switch is thrown. Repeat this process until you populate your
panel as completely as you want.
</p>
   
<p>I do one more thing with my panel. I have several hand-thrown 
switches on my layout for industrial sidings and branch lines that the dispatcher
 cannot control from his panel. I do, however have position sensors on those
 switches so that the dispatcher can see if the last crew has realigned the
 turnout back to its normal position after they have finished their work
there.
 </p>
 
<p><img src="plateSwitch.gif" alt="" width="60"
 height="60">
<img
 src="green.gif" alt="" width="10"
 height="10">
 <img
 src="red.gif" alt="" width="10"
 height="10">
 <img
 src="gray.gif" alt="" width="10"
 height="10">
  <br>
 Under those switches on the panel, I still put a switch 
plate there but instead of using the switch table, I use the sensor table. 
The plate will not have a lever but it will have the LEDs. They will change 
as the hand-throw is changed. It gives the dispatcher a visible indicator 
of the switch position.</p>
     
<p><img src="Image21.gif" width="246" height="336">
  <img src="Image22.gif" width="260" height="289">
  <img src="Image23.gif" width="217" height="216">
  </p>
     
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is the signals. Just like the evening news,
 I have saved the best part for last. This is probably the most interesting
 and challenging part of this process. You must first create you signal table
 by selecting that option from the tools menu. Then you select "Add", then
 select the SE8c aspect from the drop-down menu. You must then enter your
name for the signal in the "user name" box, then enter the turnout number
assigned to the signal head according to the SE8c address and signal assigned
to the appropriate aspect. To do this you must have the SE8c manual and READ
it. I know this goes against every instinct that you know but this is essential.
 After you have added all of the signals to the signal table, you are now
ready to do some real work.</p>

<p>
  <img src="Image25.gif" width="258" height="356">
  </p>
       
<p><img src="Image22.gif" width="260" height="289">
  <img src="Image24.gif" width="438" height="292">
  </p>
   
<p>You will now try to figure out how to make your signals
 work like the prototype you are modeling. The Simple Signal Logic tool is
 only a guide as to how you want the aspects to appear. Keep in mind, the
first word in this tool is SIMPLE. It is not designed to provide correct
aspects for a complex interlocking plant. It will protect sensors and signals
associated with it but if you are modeling 30<sup>th</sup> Street Station,
or the NYCs entrance to Chicago, you will have to learn to do some JAVA
scripting. Unfortunately, this is not what this clinic is all about. The
menus above will show the selections you have to make. In the Simple Signal
Logic tool panel, the first thing you need to enter is the line is the "Signal
Name". This is the system name that is assigned by the program automatically
after you created the signal in the Add New Signal tool. You can look the
system name up in the Signal Table that was created while you were naming
your signals. </p>
     
<p><img src="Image16.gif" width="204" height="172"></p>
     
<p>From this point, you will be doing the background work for your signals.
 After this process, you can actually take your real signals, place them
on  your layout, wire them up to your SE8c and connect it to your loconet
and  your signals will work as you programmed them. Adding them to your dispatchers
 panel is not necessary for them to work. But the reason you are all sitting
 here is because you want to have your dispatcher get the most complete picture
 of you railroad so he can efficiently keep your traffic moving and avoid
disaster.</p>
     
<p>The sample shown here, SE8c manual page 5, shows all of the choices the
 SE8c provides. A1 Main, A2 Diverging signaling at the points, B Main protection
 at the Mainline frog, and C Diverging protection at the siding or diverging
 route frog. Placing your signals is exactly the same process that you used
 when you placed your switches, levers, or sensor icons. Edit the signal
icon  in the panel editor, choosing the appropriate style and direction for
the  signal, then using the "Add Signal" in your panel-editing tool, placing
it  on the background of your panel.</p>

<p><img src="Image28.gif" width="545" height="172"></p>
     
<p>After you place all of your signals on the background it will be time
for you to see the fruits of your labor. Open the signal table, select any
signal in the table and click on the "State" button. Find the signal you
just changed on your panel and see what happened. It will now match the state
shown in the table. If your preferences are set up to work through the Locobuffer
and your layout loconet is powered up, you can walk out to the layout, find
your signal, and it should also show what the table shows. The rest is simply
repetition. Add a signal, test a signal, have a drink of celebration, add
another signal, test the signal, have another drink. Continue this process
until one of these options happen.</p>
     
<ol>
   <li>You complete your panel</li>
   <li>You run out of drinks.</li>
   <li>You collapse from exhaustion or over-indulgence of the "devil's brew".</li>
</ol>
      
<p>Congratulations !! You are now a qualified panel builder. Your services
 will be sought far and wide and you should be able to start earning the
BIG  money, just like me.</p>
     
<p>Always remember, SAVE your panel often during this process, you can always
 make changes later if you mess up but you cannot recover lost data you forgot
 to save. If you have any problems with this process remember, I am a hardware
 tech, not a programmer. The problems are always caused by the software.</p>
     
<p>I hope this clinic provided you with the proper amount of information,
 humor, and confusion to permit you to start building your panels. Thank
you  for your attention.</p>
