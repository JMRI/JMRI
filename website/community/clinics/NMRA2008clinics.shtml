At the 
<a href="http://www.nmra.org">NMRA</a>
<a href="http://www.nmra.org/2008/">Anaheim National Convention</a>, 
July 13th thru July 19th, 2008, 
there were six JMRI clinics and our traditional annual user meeting was held.
Two of the six clinics were repeated.

<p>
The slides and JMRI files from David Duchamp's Layout Editor clinic and
Dick Bronson's PanelPro clinic are availble on
<a href="clinics/NMRA2008/index.html">another page</a>.

<p>
Several of the clinics were filmed by 
<a href="http://model-railroad-hobbyist.com/">Model Railroad Hobbyist</a>
magazine, and are 
<a href="http://model-railroad-hobbyist.com/mrht_decoderpro">available from their web site</a>.
