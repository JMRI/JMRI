<h1>Permissive Block Working</h1>

<p>In the previous section of the tutorial, we placed the signal masts on the 
  Layout and created the rules between them. </p>
<p>With all the rules in place, the signals worked correctly, following the position 
  of turnouts and the occupancy of blocks. There was, however, one exception, 
  the Calling-On light which is part of the Down Approach signal. </p>
<p>The Calling-On light should be illuminated to permit shunting past the signal 
  into the Bay, even if the Bay is occupied. This is done by changing the status 
  of the Bay Block in the Blocks Table to be &quot;permissive&quot;. The check-box 
  for &quot;permissive&quot; is at the right of the very wide Blocks Table, so 
  scrolling will probably be necessary. </p>
<p>Once the Block is set to &quot;permissive&quot;, the Calling-On light will 
  behave correctly. </p>
<p>The video below shows the creation of the permissive state in the Bay Block.</p>
