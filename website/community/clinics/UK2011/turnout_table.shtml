<h1>Signal Mast Logic - Adding Turnouts and Sensors to JMRI</h1>

<p>The first stage of constructing our layout within JMRI is to make entries in
  the Turnout Table and the Sensor Table. These define the turnouts and the occupancy 
  sensors on the layout.</p>
<p><img src="images/turnouttable.jpg" width="948" height="411"></p>
<p>The above shows the turnout table with two entries. </p>
<p>Turnouts can be added with the &quot;Add...&quot; button. Our finished turnout 
  table for the layout will have three entries, one for each of our turnouts. 
</p>
<p>Note that we give them a meaningful &quot;User-Name&quot;, it is much simpler 
  to work with meaningful names, and also subsequent hardware changes are quicker 
  and easier if &quot;User-Names&quot; are used within JMRI. </p>
<p>From the table, it is possible to control the turnouts by clicking on the button 
  in the &quot;Cmd&quot; column - this is useful for testing that the table is 
  correctly constructed !</p>

<p>A similar set of entries are required for sensors in the Sensor Table. </p>
<p><img src="images/sensortable.jpg" width="627" height="266"></p>
<p>In the extract above, we have four LocoNet sensors (prefixed LS) and four internal 
  sensors (prefixed IS). The LocoNet Sensors will show &quot;active&quot; when 
  the hardware sensor detects stock on the track. Where we don't have physical 
  hardware, but anticipate needing a sensor, an Internal Sensor (prefixed IS) 
  is added. </p>
<p>As with the Turnout Table, it is important to give things meaningful entries 
  in the field &quot;User-Name&quot;. </p>
<p>The video below will step through the addition of items to the Turnout and 
  Sensor tables:</p>

<p>The download below contains the JMRI file for the work so far, it can be saved 
  locally and opened with &quot;Open Panels..&quot; on the &quot;Panels&quot; 
  menu of JMRI. </p>
