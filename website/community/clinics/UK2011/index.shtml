<h1>Signal Mast Logic - Introduction</h1>

<p><i>At the Lancashire and Yorkshire DCC exhibition in October 2011, Nigel Cliffe and 
  Kevin Dickerson presented a tutorial on using JMRI for signal control. This 
  tutorial is based on that material. </i></p>
<p>JMRI can operate signals, altering the signal due to the state of the track 
  ahead of the signal in question; what route has been set, whether other trains 
  are occupying track, etc.. JMRI has the ability to calculate signalling rules 
  based on a track diagram. The signal rules can be selected to be those of a 
  particular prototype. <br>
</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will focus on British Colour Light Signalling, following 
  the BR 2003 rulebook. Towards the end of the tutorial we will show how British 
  Semaphore Signals can be used. ( The construction of rules for mechanical interlocked 
  signal boxes is not part of the tutorial.). </p>
<p>The tutorial was written for a LocoNet based system. There are a number of 
  panel files which can be downloaded as part of the tutorial which shows the 
  JMRI files at various stages of construction. If you wish to use these and do 
  not have a Digitrax/LocoNet system, then we recommend you set your JMRI preferences 
  to &quot;Digitrax - LocoNet Simulation&quot; which will allow the files to work 
  correctly without connection to external layout hardware. </p>
<p>The tutorial is broken into a number of pages. </p>
