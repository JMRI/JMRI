<h1>Using Semaphore Signals rather than Colour Lights</h1>

<p>So far, this tutorial has used colour light signals. However, semaphore signals
  can be used in place of colour lights. </p>
<p>Bear in mind that this approach to signal control is based on signalling techniques 
  which are not the same as a lever frame in a signal box. There is a presumption 
  that the signals will go to &quot;proceed&quot; if the line is clear ahead, 
  rather than the signalman in his box only pulling the levers for the signals 
  when he is ready for a train to proceed. </p>
<p>There is also a feature yet to be developed; at present the instructions to 
  change state are sent to all signal heads simultaneously. Thus, if you have 
  a mast with two semaphore arms (say a home plus distant), it is likely that 
  both arms will move together. A feature enhancement request to change this within 
  JMRI has been made, but no date yet given for implementation. </p>
<h3>Creating semaphore masts</h3>
<p>A Semaphore Mast is created in the same way as a colour light mast. The arms 
  are each defined as &quot;signal heads&quot; and the combination of arms (heads) 
  are made onto a Mast. The definition of the Mast is in the signalling rules 
  of the prototype, in our demonstration layout this is BR signalling. </p>
<p>Once the Mast has been created, it is positioned at a block boundary in the 
  same way as the colour light signals, and the rules from one signal to the next 
  created in the same manner as before. </p>
<p><i>The Video covering this part of the tutorial is in preparation. </i></p>
