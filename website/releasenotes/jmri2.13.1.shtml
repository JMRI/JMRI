      Release Notes for JMRI 2.13.1 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: Sept 20, 2011</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.13.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.14 or 3.0 production release.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<b>DecoderPro 3</b>
<p>"DecoderPro 3" is a new presentation of locomotives/decoders in the roster,
making it easier to organise and access decoder programming features.  It has a
new menu structure, locomotives are listed in a table which can be sorted on any
column. "DecoderPro 3" has two programmer types; Basic and Comprehensive, plus
setup of features such as throttle function keys and roster media (pictures of
locomotives).   We have tried with the design of "DecoderPro 3" to focus on the
needs of those who use JMRI primarily for adjusting CV settings in their
locomotives.</p>

<p>This release of "DecoderPro 3" is a test.  There are a few more features we'd
like to add, but before doing that we need feedback from users; does it work for
you, what do you want to see changed, etc..  We'll look at all the information
which comes back and incorporate it in future developments.</p>

<p>We have tested "DecoderPro 3" and are not expecting major file-damaging faults.
But with any test-release of software there is always a small risk that
something has been overlooked.  So, please check that you have a backup of your
Roster files just incase something unexpected happens.  If you install with the
Windows installer, a backup copy of your old files (including the roster) is
created by default.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

The way in which UserNames are edited has now changed in the tables, 
renames are now performed via a mouse pop-up menu and can not be directly edited.

<p>
The method we use for building release files has been extensively changed. Please let us know of any problems
with installation or unpacking.

<p>
JMRI 2.12 is the last release which is completely supported by Java 1.5.
Starting with this release, there will be minor interface features, such as 
drag-and-drop of some items, that require your computer to have Java 1.6 installed.
Computers with only Java 1.5 will still be able to use JMRI, including PanelPro and DecoderPro,
through the end of this 2.13.* release cycle.  Releases in the next cycle
will require Java 1.6.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

(None yet)

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

After the release, a problem opening certain QSI decoder definitions was found.  Most
decoder definitions do work, but QSI V6 (and perhaps a few other QSI decoders) do not.
This will be fixed in the next test release.

<ul>
	<li>You can now show the timetable name on your manifests and switch lists.  See under Settings-&gt;Tools

	when creating manifests.</li> 
	<li>Manifest and switch list font size can now be increased to 14 points.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where a car would be set out to a track that wasn't to be serviced as determined by the train's direction.
	This only occurred when a train visited a location more than once.  Thank you Steve Davis for bring this bug to our attention.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem when generating a car load from staging and the spur would not service the default load empty.  Thank
	you Frank Wyatt for bringing this bug to our attention.</li> 	
	<li>You can now use a text editor to preview and edit your train manifest and switch lists. Requires Java 1.6 and jar file from
	my <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~daboudreau/JMRI_JAVA1.6/jmri.jar">site</a>. See Print Options under Settings-&gt;Tools.</li>
	<li>Improved how the program selects the departure track from staging, now if the train requires a caboose or car with FRED,
	all tracks in staging are checked.</li>
	
</ul>
