<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the almost-last in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.6 production release around the end of the year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.5.5:</h3>

   <p>Steve Todd fixed a problem with starting the LocoNetOverTcp server when running the JMRI
    faceless app.
   
   <p>Suzie Tall created a new signal head type "Triple Output RGB". It is based on the existing
    triple output class and takes the same input as the quad output. The three outputs drive the
    red, green and blue inputs of a RGB searchlight head to give Red, Green, Yellow and Lunar
    indications both steady and flashing as well as dark.
   
   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>New feature for folks using schedules to route cars. On a per train basis, you can ask
     the program to pull cars with a final destination where the train being built doesn't provide
     the most efficient route for the car. Useful if you want to the train being built to move cars
     "closer" to their final destination, even if other trains could do it more efficiently. This
     option does two things, it will add cars to the train being built that wouldn't normally travel
     on the train, thus freeing up track space. And second creates more work for your operators as this
     option can and will increase the number of trains needed to move the car to its final
     destination. See under Tools->Train Build Options from the Train Edit window, select "Service
     all cars with a final destination" if you want your train to carry more cars.</li>
     <li>Updated the "Show cars types serviced" tool for a train.  The window now shows any track
     destination restrictions for a selected car.</li>
   </ul>

    <p>Dave Heap improved the tooltips for lots and lots of decoder definitions to make them more consistent
    
    <p> M. Greene added Digitrax decoder types
    
    <P>A bug in SRCP support was fixed.  It preventing storing panel files with
    certain kinds of SRCP information present.
