<!-- 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.4 production release at mid-year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

The decoder definition files have been extensively reworked for this release
to reduce their size and allow  them to be translated to other languages.
Please keep an eye out for any inadvertent changes to the definitions 
that might have been introduced.

<p>
A lot of work is being done to allow JMRI to be translated to other
languages.  This could break how text in various parts of JMRI is presented.
If anything looks odd, please let us know.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since production release 3.2:</h3>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You can now control loads for trains and tracks by the type of car. Previously only the
     load name was available. Now you can control by load names, and by car type and load name.</li>
    <li>You can now decide if you want indenting when looking at build reports with a text
     editor.</li>
    <li>New feature, the program will now generate custom car loads for car's departing staging
     and also terminating into staging. See Edit Staging track, and select "Generate custom loads
     for any staging track". You can control which loads will be generated by adjusting the terminal
     track and which loads the train departing staging can carry.</li>
    <li>You can now edit a car's move count, wait, built, owner, RFID, and value fields
     directly in the Cars window.</li>
    <li>Improved the car wait feature. Now the car's wait will only decrement when the train
     can actually service the car, not just passing through.</li>
    <li>You can now adjust the tab length if you're using the tabular format for your manifests
     and switch lists. See in the Manifest Print Options under Tools.</li>
    <li>Fixed a line formatting problem with manifest and switch lists that have carriage
     returns embedded in the comments.</li>
     <li>The conductor window will now show locomotives assigned to the train.</li>
     <li>Made some improvements in the print locations tool with regards to schedules.</li>
    <li>More build report formatting and readability improvements.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Kevin Dickerson made the following changes :</p>
    <ul>
    <li>CAN Ethernet - Added the ability to select the correct protocol</li>
    <li>Merg CBUS Ethernet - Added in a new adapter to handle this configuration</li>
    <li>LocoNetOverTCP - Fix an issue with the connection details that prevented it from being loaded.</li>
    <li>Ecos - Fixed a minor issue with the way that the speed step reply was processed that cuased an error</li>
    <li>SignalMasts (New Feature) - Added in the ability to repeat the state of one SignalMast onto another and vice-versa</li>
    <li>Layout Editor - Added in the ability to rotate Slips</li>
    <li>Include internal block boundaries on the continuing path of a crossover as a valid location for setting a signalmast/sensor</li>
    <li>SignalHeads - Fixed an issue which prevent the Add button from working correctly</li>
    <li>SignalMast Logic - Update the user defined blocks so that they are updated when user names are changed and move</li>
    <li>Decoder Selection - Added a Show/Hide facility on matched decoders after the decoder has been read</li>
    <li>DP3 - The new Loco window, now allows you to create a basic roster entry without having to open a separate window</li>
    </ul>

<p>
Dan Boudreau added support for NCE USB / PowerCab version 7. NCE now supports the use of AUIs
for sensors when using a NCE USB and PowerCab. You need to have the latest USB interface which
is version 7.x.x and your PowerCab must be version 1.65 or newer.

<p>
Enzo Fortuna made more updates to the Italian translation.
This includes numerous changes to the coding for existing (English) strings,
so please comment if you notice something missing.

<p>
The JUnit unit tests were reorganized at the top level.

<p>
Fixed a problem with MS100 mode. Note that MS100 is only available on
certain older Windows machines; this fix doesn't change that, just
restores some function lost in JMRI 3.2. In the long run, you need
to replace your MS100 with something from this century.

<p>
The Xerces-J parser used to read and write XML files was updated to version 2.11.0

<p>
More changes for internationalization, particularly for the operations code by
Dan Boudreau.  Enzo Fortuna has made large updates to the the Italian language support,
including Digitrax and Lenz decoder definitions.

<p>
More reducing decoder definitions to common form via XInclude of "part files".

<p>
Dave Heap changed the preferences associated with roster location and "User File Location".
He also added support for ESU's new M&auml;rklin-style speed tables in LokSound 4.0 decoders.

<p>
Dave Heap improved some of the file-location-related terminology.

<p>
Paco Ca&ntilde;ada provided decoder definitions for PpP decoders.

<p>
Changes for Virtual Sound Decoder (by Mark Underwood)
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a LOT of bugs from 3.2.0. Some big ones are called out
  specifically below.</li>
  <li>Added support for designating a location as being inside a
  tunnel (still experimental)</li>
  <li>Added the ability to assign a Physical Location to a Block if
  that Block is associated with a Reporter.  This gives added
  resolution in locating the train, under certain circumstances.</li>
  <li>Engine start sound now only played when throttle is at
  idle.</li>
  <li>Added filesystem browsers to the default path and file entries
  in the Preferences</li>
  <li>VSD file can now explicitly indicate which defined Diesel notch
  is the Idle notch.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Walt Thompson fixed links in several help pages.

<p>
Fixed problem when exporting roster files.

<p>
Fred Dalzell added a definition for the MRC Steam Sync Mini decoder MRC_soundbrilliance1869.xml

<P>
Gert Muller fixed a problem when storing panels from the web client.
