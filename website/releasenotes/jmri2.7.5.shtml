      Release Notes for JMRI 2.7.5 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: September 7, 2009</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.7.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>  -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fifth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.8 production release in December 2009. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>Better handling of local files for panels, icons, etc, to make it easier to
    move your work from one computer to another.
<li>Improved SoundTraxx decoder definitions, but see the warnings.
<li>Many improvements to the usability of the Panel Editor, including the ability to
    grab and move groups of icons, and better control over placement and rotation.
<li>Great new <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/Audio.shtml">Audio support</a>.
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

The new audio support in JMRI 2.7.5 requires some new libraries.
Those libraries are included in the JMRI downloads.  They, in turn, require that the
startup scripts include the new libraries, so these have also been modified.
The 2.7.4 and earlier scripts will not work with 2.7.5 and later.  In particular, if you've
created your own copies of startup scripts, you'll have to update those:

<p>
If your roster contains locomotives with Soundtraxx Steam Tsunami decoders,
you should migrate those roster entries to the new decoder definition names.
We've created a tool to make that easier.
For information on how to use that tool, please see the 
<a href="decoder2.7.5.shtml">separate note</a>.



<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

JMRI 2.7.4 changes the way filenames for icons, etc, are stored in XML files by JMRI.
The advantage is that this new method will make it much easier to move 
panel files from one computer to another, even of a different type.  So long as you
keep all your files in the JMRI preferences directory on both machines, the files
should just move over without trouble.  The warning is that files written in this 
format will not be properly read by JMRI versions before 2.7.4.
This includes files
from earlier versions that are read by JMRI 2.7.4 or later and then written out again, 
as the program will update them to the new format upon storing them.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.7.4</h3>

<p>
Pete Cressman fixed a problem storing and loading the new Memory Spinner Icon, 
improved some labeling in the icon selector, 
and added more controls to the memory icon popup menu.

<p>
When storing references to files, e.g. custom icons in panel files
if the file is stored in your home directory, JMRI will store a relative "home:" 
reference, in addition to the already-present detection for files in the
JMRI program and preferences directory. This makes it easier to move panel files
from computer to computer; just make sure you have the icons, etc, in the same relative
place on the two machines.

<p>
Ken Cameron added sensor support for X10 Powerline devices.  Once you have manually created
a sensor using the Sensor Table, changed heard on the Powerline will adjust the corresponding
sensor's state.

<p>
Pete Cressman made some improvement to Panel Editor icon handling.

<p>
Pete Cressman added group icon capture and move in the Panel Editor.
When a panel in put in "repositioned"  mode, 
a click and drag that begins in an open area will draw a red rectangle.  
All the non-fixed icons captured within this "fence" can be moved as a group by 
dragging any one of the captured icons.   
"Non-fixed" means the icons that do not have their "fixed" or "locked" 
items checked in their popup menus.
A group of icons captured by the "red fence" can be aligned by their upper left corners 
horizontally or vertically by selecting the "Align Vertically", or "Align Horizontally" items 
in one of the captured icon's popup menu.  
These items appear only when the icon is captured.  
This alignment will only occur to the unfixed and unlocked icons.

<p>
Paul Bender fixed a problem with XPressNet throttle setup that was particularly problematic for Hornby users.

<p>
Ken Cameron improved his RobotThrottle script.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added status information to the operations route table.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson improved the way we check for duplicate roster IDs to catch some additional
cases.

<p>
Paul Bender corrected a bug in XPressNet LI100 programmer which made it difficult to read 
multiple values from a decoder (single reads were ok).

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added a capability to connect locomotive information in the ECoS command station to JMRI.

<p>
Ken Cameron added a horn button to the RobotThrottle.

<P>
Paul Bender added some additional error messages to the DCC programmer.

<p>
Sakae Akanuma added a Japanese translation.

<p>
Dan Boudreau improved the NCE Show Cab feature.

<p>
Pete Cressman fixed a bug in the memory compare in Logix

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a bug with rotating square icons.

<p>
Ken Cameron updated his RobotThrottle2 and DebounceSensor scripts.

<p>
Pete Cressman improved rotations of icons to the panel editor, and 
added scaling and repositioning.
A new "Rotate (degrees)" item was added to the popup menu.  
The former "Rotation" item is now labeled "Rotate (Orthogonal)".  
"Rotate (degrees)" will rotate an icon an arbitrary number of degrees.  
Each "Rotation" item resets the other.  
The "Scale (percentage)" popup item enlarges or shrinks the icon by the percentage input.  
To scale and rotate, use "Rotate (degrees)".
A "Shift-Drag" feature allows repositioning of the icons in a layer beneath an icon, while holding the top icon in place.

<p>
Ken Cameron fixed the problem that would cause startup errors if you configure a clock (analog, digital or Nixie) to open at startup.

<p>
Matt Harris fixed the way the preferences store the GUI selection to avoid occasional problems.

<p>
Matt Harris added great new <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/Audio.shtml">Audio support</a>,
including a <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/AudioExample.py">demo script</a> that shows off many of the features.

<p>
Peter Ulvestad added a definition for the DN163K1D decoder and updated 'maxMotorCurrents' on the DN163K1A,B,C.

<p>
Jack Shall reworked the Soundtraxx Bachmann OEM decoder definition.

<p>
Mike Mosher updated the ESU XL V3.5 decoder definition to 
fix acc/dec on motor tab and incorporate latest changes from LS V3.5 file.

<p>
Mike Mosher updated the QSI Gas Turbine decoder definition to add "Code Horn for Gas Turbine Startup".

changed the Lenz tab name to Bachmann, updated
dimensions and default values as per decoder manual and added factory reset menu items.

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a minor bug when building trains from staging tracks without engines.  
Builds would sometimes fail if the staging tracks didn't have engines.  
Fix now allows trains to be build from staging without requiring engines.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added a new "failedThrottleRequest" function to the core Throttle support, 
so that if System-specific throttles are unable to create a throttle, 
then the address is removed from the throttleListeners Hashmap, and hence prevents the DCC address being locked out.

<p>
Andrew Crosland added support for CBUS CV programmers.

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a minor operations bug to allow terminating a train into staging without an engine.

<p>
Paul Bender fixed an error when parsing an "unsupported command" XPressNet response message.

<p>
Paul Bender changed the XPressNet code: instead of sending emergency stop to a MultiMaus 
(which doesn't support the emergency stop command?) send speed 0.

<p>
Peter Ulvestad updated the Bachmann EZ DCC, and EZ DCC 1 function
decoder definitions to change the model name, added decoder dimensions, 
update defaults and cleaned up the formatting.

<p>
