      Release Notes for JMRI 3.11.3 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: February 15, 2015</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.11.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2015.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at release time.

<!-- 
If any of those effect you, please either wait for 
<a href="jmri3.11.2.shtml">JMRI 3.11.2</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or pick up a 
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>The Save button in the Preferences window now only prompts for restarts if required.
There may be instances when pressing save incorrectly fails to prompt to restart JMRI or
prompts to restart JMRI when it should not.</p>

<p>This JMRI version removes some files that were present in earlier versions.
Failure to remove these can result in some portions of
JMRI (notably the web server) failing to function correctly.
If you are updating an existing JMRI installation to this version 
<a href="../install/Linux.html#update">Linux</a>, 
you must remove any older version of JMRI or unpack this
version of JMRI in an alternate location. 
The recommended update procedures for JMRI on
<a href="../install/WindowsNew.shtml#update">Microsoft Windows (run the installer)</a> 
and 
<a href="../install/MacOSX.html#update">Mac OS X (open disk image and drag to final location, e.g. Applications folder)</a> 
remove/replace the older version of JMRI, ensuring that these obsolete files are not 
present.
</p>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>This release, and all later releases in this cycle, require Java 1.8 or higher.
To use this or any later JMRI releases, you'll have to 
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or higher.
</p>

<p>This release uses JDOM 2.0.5, which requires some code changes if you are directly
calling the parts of JMRI that interchange XML objects.</P>

<p>There are now separate settings for the default Service Mode Programmer and 
for the default Ops Mode Programmer.  If you're using two or more system connections,
this lets you use one connection for ops mode (on track) programming and another connection
for your programming track. If you're using two separate connections, you
should go to the Defaults pane on the Preferences window and check that those 
defaults were set properly.</p>

<p> If you are making a direct connection to a Intellibox unit via
    serial or USB, you will have to reselect your preferences.
    See the 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Uhlenbrock.shtml">Uhlenbrock support page</a> 
    for instructions.</p>

<p> If you are using an NCE USB adapter, you will have to reselect your preferences
     the first time you use a JMRI 3.11 version (if you set them using JMRI 3.10 or earlier).
    See the 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/nce/NCE.shtml">page on configuring JMRI for NCE</a> 
    for instructions.</p>

<p>Because of internal code changes, this version of JMRI is not compatible with
<a href="http://cats4ctc.org"><!-- was http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/ --> CATS 2.34</a> or earlier.  Keep using 
<a href="jmri3.10.shtml">JMRI 3.10</a> with CATS until there's a CATS update that
says it will work with JMRI 3.11.</p>

<p>The XmlIO web service has been removed. All users who were relying on the
XmlIO API are recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle
users are recommended to begin using webThrottle instead, or invest in devices
that can support webThrottle, the iOS WiThrottle, or the Android Engine
Driver.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.11.2:</h3>

<p>Ken Cameron fixed a problem (present since 3.11.1) that prevented the NCE Consist tool window from opening.

<p>Fixed a stall occasionally encountered when running a locomotive to measure a speed table via a LocoNet connection.

<p>Fixed a problem where, if the decoder definition causes DecoderPro or DecoderPro3 to select a non-default
    programming mode, that wasn't properly being displayed.

<p>Randall Wood fixed a problem that would cause an exception when starting without an existing configuration.

        to emphasise that &quot;label&quot; and &quot;tooltip&quot; attributes <strong><em>should not</em></strong>
        be added to a &quot;fnmapping&quot; element (they are ignored).</p>

    <h5>Fleischmann</h5>
        <p>Xavier Chazelle contributed a decoder definition for 
            the N scale Fleischmann "Leig einheit" F830681 double unit of van equipped with a 
            Fleischmann-specific dual decoder for opening or closing doors

    <h5>Zimo</h5>      
        <p>Nigel Cliffe and Mark Waters did a lot of work on the Zimo decoders.    
        
<h4>Operations</h4>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>New feature for schedules. You can now select a random value for any schedule item. For
     example if you select 15 as the random value, you have a 15% chance that this item will be
     selected. Great feature for RIP tracks where you would like to randomly send a car to
     maintenance.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem where manifests and switch lists wouldn't preview or print if there
     wasn't a logo specified. Problem was introduced in versions 3.11.1 and 3.11.2</li>
    <li>Improved the "Two Column by Track" manifest and switch list format to automatically not
     show the car's track name. Allows the conductor and yardmaster windows to now show the track
     name when using the "Two Column by Track" format.</li>
    <li>New feature when departing staging, you can now control the maximum number of cars that
     can depart out of staging. By adjusting the number of cars requested in the train's route
     departure staging location, you can have the program select a staging track that has a number
     of cars equal to or less than requested. Note that if you set the requested number of cars out
     of staging to zero, the program will look for a staging track that doesn't have any cars. This
     new feature could cause existing trains builds to fail. To fix this type of build failure, just
     enter in the train's route departure staging location a number of requested cars greater than
     the numbers of cars that can fit on the departure staging track. For example, if your staging
     track can fit 12 cars maximum, a request of 12 cars or more should fix the build failure if
     there was one.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Blocks</h4>
    <p>Fixed a problem where the Block Table would throw errors at various times
        when JMRI was in a locale where decimal numbers are written 0,00 (as opposed to 0.00).
        
<h4>Preferences</h4>

	<p>The parameters for ramping speed changes used by Warrants and the Speed Map are now accessible
	through Preferences.</p>
	
	<p>Clicking the Save button now prompts to restart only if the preferences have changed
	and if the change requires a restart. (Randall Wood)</p>
	
	<p>Closing the Preferences window now prompts to save or discard preferences if the
	preferences have been changed. (Randall Wood)</p>

<h4>Web Server</h4>

	<p>Fix an issue preventing the Web Throttle from handling certain turnouts. (Randall Wood)</p>
	
	<p>Fix an issue preventing the Web Throttle from loading rosters. (Randall Wood)</p>
	
	<p>Fix an issue preventing the Web Throttle from setting routes. (Ken Cameron)</p>
	
	<p>Remove documentation and examples that use the XmlIO protocol.</p>

	<p>The Web Server has been upgraded from Jetty 8.1.11 to 9.2.7. This is expected to
	improve performance, especially on constrained devices such as the Raspberry Pi.
	(Randall Wood)</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

	<p>LinkingLabels will now restore a minimized frame on Windows (already worked this way in Linux)	(mstevetodd)</p>
	
	<p>Add ability to specify the default location for new configuration profiles. (Randall Wood)</p>
