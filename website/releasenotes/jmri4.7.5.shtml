      Release Notes for JMRI 4.7.5 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: June 8, 2017</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.7.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the fifth in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2017.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
This test release is the last in the series to contain big, new features and changes;
the next few tests releases (up until the production release) will contain just incremental fixes and improvements.
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Required Migration Step<span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a></span></h3>
JMRI was updated in JMRI 4.7.4 to use a new serial library. Depending on your exact
circumstances, you may need to do some migrations:
<ul>
<li>If you are using JMRI on Linux or Mac OS X and are updating from an older JMRI version,
<em>you must open the JMRI preferences and make sure that the selections are 
correct for your serial device(s).</em> Be sure to save the changes.
<p>
In general, previous versions used serial device names like 
"/dev/cu.usbserial-ABC123FG". This version will generally omit the prefix, and
use serial device names like "cu.usbserial-ABC123FG".
(If given the choice if a name starting with "tty" and one starting with "cu", 
pick the "cu" one). See the before and after images to the right.
<li>
If you are using Linux and have previously used the "JMRI_SERIAL_PORTS"
option to make sure your serial device is visible to JMRI, you'll have 
to change that to use the "purejavacomm.portnamepattern" option instead.
See the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/install/FAQLinux.shtml#usb">JMRI Linux install page</a> for more information.
<li>
If you have your own JMRI scripts to access a serial device, you'll have to update
their library references:
    <ul>
    <li>Any 
        <code>import gnu.io</code> statements will have to be replaced by 
        <code>import purejavacomm</code> statements.
    <li>More generally, any reference to 
        <code>gnu.io</code>, e.g. a reference to a class like 
        <code>gnu.io.SerialPort</code>, statements will have to be replaced by 
        a reference to the corresponding 
        <code>purejavacomm</code> class.
    </ul>
</ul>

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<ul>
    <li>None at release time
    </li>
</ul>

<!--
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.7.6.shtml">JMRI 4.7.6</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>This version of JMRI (and all later) writes a slightly streamlined
        version of panel file contents.  
        Older files should still be readable by this version of JMRI, 
        but files written by this version may not be readable by versions
        before JMRI 4.2 depending on their contents.</li>
    <li>The LocoNetOverTCP server has changes that may break scripts that reference it. Scripts refering to
        the class jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.Server need to refer instead to
        jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.LnTcpServer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.6.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.6 release note</a> for warnings predating the 4.6 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.3</a></span> This release will not start cleanly if installed over earlier versions of JMRI (the Windows installer ensures
    this is not an issue). Remove the JAR files <em>jackson-annotations-2.0.6.jar</em>, <em>jackson-core-2.0.6.jar</em>,
    and <em>jackson-databind-2.0.6.jar</em> from the <em>lib</em> directory within the previous installation directory to resolve
    this.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span> JMRI no longer supports the portable paths <code>resource:</code> or <code>file:</code> that
        were deprecated in JMRI 2.13. When loading a panel, an error message will be displayed
        if the panel contains a path that starts with <code>resource:</code> and the panel will
        not load until changed using an external editor. Paths starting with <code>file:</code>
        cannot be automatically flagged because JMRI allows file: URLs.
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span>
        The LocoNet Server (the LocoNetRMI service; not the LocoNetOverTcp service)
        in this version of JMRI doesn't properly interoperate with 
        <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a> through <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a>.
        It does work fine with <a href="jmri4.6.shtml">JMRI version 4.6</a> or before.
        If you encounter a problem with version compatibility, you'll see an error
        message that includes "<code>local class incompatible</code>".
        The workaround is to update both client and server JMRI machines to the same
        JMRI version. 
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span> JMRI applications will not load a panel file that fails XML validation; an error will be
        shown that should explains the error, allowing it to be fixed using an editor. (The
	    explanations remain a work in progress.)

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.6.shtml">JMRI 4.5.6</a></span>  
        As part of fixing the 
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/2081">TMCC throttle issue</a>,
        the handling of TMCC preferences was changed.  If you have a TMCC
        connection configured, please go to the 
        "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Connection">Defaults</a>"
        pane in the Preferences window and make sure that the 
        TMCC connection is selected for the appropriate device types.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span> This and future releases of JMRI may not function on OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. OS X
    operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
    user's group.
    To remove Java SE 6 from OS X, follow these steps (these steps assume
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>, if not,
      adjust the following paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command <code>/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh</code> It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
          It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
        </li>
      <li><em>El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span> Support for directly executing AppleScript within JMRI has been removed
    due to changes in macOS and Java outside our control. If you require the
    ability to use AppleScript, you may be able to add this capability on your
    own by visiting <a href="https://jmri.github.io/applescript">JMRI
      AppleScript Support</a>, but please be aware that this may not work
    on upcoming releases of macOS or Java.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.1.shtml">JMRI 4.5.1</a></span> 
    Internal turnouts and sensors need to have complete, individual system names.
    The names "IT" and "IS" (without any suffix) are no longer permitted:
    "IT12" is fine, but just "IT" is not. Most panel files that contain these should
    automatically migrate them to new names when saved, but in some cases you might need to manually update them.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.3.3.shtml">JMRI 4.3.3</a></span>
    You can now set the order of your startup items: If you're opening panel files, running scripts, etc as
    the program starts up, there's a preferences pane that lets you easily set the order in which those happen.
    If you've set the order manually (e.g. by editing configuration files) in the past, please check this
    preference to make sure it's set the way you want.</p>

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.1.2.shtml">JMRI 4.1.2</a></span>
    Jython has been upgraded to version 2.7.0 with the following potentially breaking changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The decodeJmriFilename() function is no longer available by default. Use the  FileUtil.getExternalFilename() method instead.</li>
      <li>The simple propertyListener object is no longer available by default. Create your own, following the examples provided in the jython folder in the JMRI distribution.</li>
      <li>jmri_defaults.py included in the JMRI distribution is no longer executed by default, but will be executed before any other Jython scipts if included in your User Files location.</li>
      <li>The default behavior of python.cachedir.skip is now true. If using a custom python.properties file, include "python.cachedir.skip=false" in that file.</li>
      <li>Certain Python scripts are too large to be evaluated in Jython. If a script fails with the <code>java.io.IOException: Mark invalid</code> error, set "jython.exec=true" in a custom python.properties file or rewrite the script to be less than 100,000 characters per file. Note that when using "jython.exec=true" it may be desirable to run the included script jmri_bindings.py as a startup action to emulate the evaluation environment used when jython.exec=false.</li>
    </ul>

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.1.1.shtml">JMRI 4.1.1</a></span>
    Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  Definitions
    included with this release have been converted to the new form.
    If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
    validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
    Please ask on the JMRI Users group
    for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.</p>

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">test release 4.7.4</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aclosed&q=milestone%3A4.7.5+">list of included commits</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The Single CV Programmer now supports Ops Mode Accessory Programming
                (Program Accessory Decoder on the Main).
                <br>This should work with most DCC systems<sup>*</sup>,
                but only with Accessory Decoders that support this programming mode.
                (Dave Heap)
                <br><br><sup>*</sup>Please advise if your system does not work,
                preferably by creating a
                <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/" target="_blank">new issue on GitHub</a>.
                We may be able to help.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
		
        <h4>C/MRI</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Some additional work on the multi-connection support.  JMRI should be 
                able to support mixed sets of cable connected (e.g. serial) C/MRI and 
                network connected C/MRI by defining multiple connections.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Digitrax</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The LocoNet Download Firmware tool has been updated to report an error when reading a 
                firmware download file which is for a device which requires special LocoNet message timings
                which are not supported by this tool.  Using the wrong protocol would corrupt the device's
                firmware and require factory repair of the unit.  This change prevents this tool from 
                corrupting the firmware of devices including the DCS210, DCS210, DB210, DB210-Opto, and DB220.
                The Digitrax program <em>DigiIPLII.exe</em> may be used to perform firmware updates for these devices.</li>

                <li>The LocoNet Download Firmware tool has been updated to provide slower timings which 
                improve the success-rate of firmware updates, including the UR92.  The tool was also improved
                to prevent other GUI operations from inadvertently interrupting a progressing firmware update.</li>
		
                <li>LocoBuffer, LocoBuffer-II, and LocoBuffer-USB connections may be configured as "Standalone LocoNet" 
		            connections.</li>

		        <li>LocoStats Monitor was corrected to display only "interface status" LocoNet messages.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SPROG</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The SPROG command station code has been updated to fix an issue whereby users had observed
		            very slow packet update rates on the rails causing locos to become unresponsive.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Signal Heads</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml ">JMRI 4.7.3</a>, we added support for SE8c Signal Heads
                    listening to the layout and (attempting to) follow messages that are
                    happening there, so that if something other than JMRI changed 
                    the SE8c-shown color, the JMRI icon(s) would follow.  That 
                    didn't work right, so we fixed it in 4.7.4, and fixed it again.
                    But we now understand that it can never really work right, 
                    there's not enough information in the SE8c hardware messages.
                    To prevent this from causing problems, we've removed that message-following, so the
                    SE8c SignalHead in JMRI itself is now back to as it was in JMRI 4.7.2
                    and before.  But in case somebody is willing to work through
                    the imperfections to do something like this our their own layout, 
                    we've added a new 
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/FollowSE8c.py">jython/FollowSE8c.py sample script</a>,
                    along with a 
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/test/FollowSE8cTest.py">test case</a>
                    that shows you how it works.</li>
            </ul>

   <h3>Internationalization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sonnys Hansen provided updates to the Danish translation</li>
            <li>Egbert Broerse updated the Dutch translation</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This version writes a slightly more verbose version of 
                panel files to (attempt to) have them readable all the
                way back to JMRI 4.2.  (JMRI 4.7.4 wrote files that
                could only be read by JMRI 4.7.4 and later)</li>
