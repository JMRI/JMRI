      Release Notes for JMRI 4.15.2 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date:January 11, 2019</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.15.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release during early Summer 2019.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.11.9 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running OK before
        updating to this test release.  Once you have JMRI 4.12 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been a number of 
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    you <u>must</u> 
    update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to this release.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.11.3.shtml">JMRI 4.11.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.14.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.14 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.15 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li><br>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li><br>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li><br>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li><br>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li><br>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.2.shtml">JMRI 4.11.2</a></span>
    The system connection preferences (i.e. hardware preferences) are now
    enforcing the <a href="jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">correct form</a>
    for system prefixes:  One upper case letter, 
    optionally followed by a number (one or more digits, e.g. "L12").
    Existing prefixes in existing configurations are unchanged, but
    new ones will have to have the correct form. If your layout uses 
    a non-compliant prefix, i.e. "DX", "DCCPP", "DP", "MR", "MC", "PI", or "TM"
    please contact us for help in getting it migrated to a proper form.
    JMRI 4.16 will <u>require</u> that this have been fixed.
