<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the second in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.12 or 3.0 production release in December 2010. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>Many improvements to the operations features
<li>iPhone, Android, web browser and Wii throttles improved in important ways
<li>Change to table windows to make them easier to use
<li>Significant internal updates
</ul>
along with other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.
