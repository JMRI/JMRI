      Release Notes for JMRI 4.11.5 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: April 15, 2017</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.11.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- <p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p> -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2018.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Required Migration Step<span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a></span></h3>
JMRI was updated in JMRI 4.7.4 to use a new serial library. Depending on your exact
circumstances, you may need to do some migrations:
<ul>
    <li>If you are using JMRI on Linux or Mac OS X and are updating from an older JMRI version,
        <em>you must open the JMRI preferences and make sure that the selections are 
        correct for your serial device(s).</em> Be sure to save the changes.
        <p>
        In general, previous versions used serial device names like 
        "/dev/cu.usbserial-ABC123FG". This version will generally omit the prefix, and
        use serial device names like "cu.usbserial-ABC123FG".
        (If given the choice if a name starting with "tty" and one starting with "cu", 
        pick the "cu" one). See the before and after images to the right.
    <li>
        If you are using Linux and have previously used the "JMRI_SERIAL_PORTS"
        option to make sure your serial device is visible to JMRI, you'll have 
        to change that to use the "purejavacomm.portnamepattern" option instead.
        See the 
        <a href="http://jmri.org/install/FAQLinux.shtml#usb">JMRI Linux install page</a> for more information.
    <li>
        If you have your own JMRI scripts to access a serial device, you'll have to update
        their library references:
            <ul>
            <li>Any 
                <code>import gnu.io</code> statements will have to be replaced by 
                <code>import purejavacomm</code> statements.
            <li>More generally, any reference to 
                <code>gnu.io</code>, e.g. a reference to a class like 
                <code>gnu.io.SerialPort</code>, statements will have to be replaced by 
                a reference to the corresponding 
                <code>purejavacomm</code> class.
            </ul>
</ul>


<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.11.3.shtml">JMRI 4.11.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Due to a new bug in this release, deleting a Sensor, Turnout, Light, etc, will
        cause problems when you subsequently store the configuration.  
        This has been fixed for JMRI 4.11.6.
        <p>If you delete items from the Tables, you should avoid this release.
        (Lots of people don't have a need to delete items, and this bug won't
        cause them any problems)</li>
    <li>Due to a new bug in this release, opening a locomotive in DecoderPro "Edit mode" (not connected to the layout)
        might not work.  
        This has been fixed for JMRI 4.11.6.
        <p>The workaround is to open it in as if using the
        programming track, even if there's not one connected.
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.10.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.10 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.11 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    The <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml#LE">additions to Layout Editor in JMRI 4.11.4</a> mean that
    files containing Layout Editor panels written by JMRI 4.11.4 or later will fail a 
    validation check in JMRI 4.11.3 or earlier. 
    If you back-date your JMRI version and need to to get past this, please
    <a href="#validate">bypass validation</a>.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    If you are running a local web site with a copy of the JMRI content, as
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml#local">described here</a>,
    please repeat 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml#locallink">the "setSymLinks.sh" step</a>
    near the bottom of those instructions
    after installing JMRI 4.11.4 (or later).  This will make some new formatting available
    on your local site.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li><br>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li><br>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li><br>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li><br>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li><br>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.2.shtml">JMRI 4.11.2</a></span>
    The system connection preferences (i.e. hardware preferences) are now
    enforcing the <a href="jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">correct form</a>
    for system prefixes:  One upper case letter, 
    optionally followed by a number (one or more digits, e.g. "L12").
    Existing prefixes in existing configurations are unchanged, but
    new ones will have to have the correct form.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.9.4.shtml">JMRI 4.9.4</a></span>
    Due to changes in the capitalization of some method and property names, some scripts may fail until
    adjusted to use the new capitalization. The <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc">Javadocs</a> for any
    JMRI class will list the correct capitalization.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.9.4.shtml">JMRI 4.9.4</a></span>
    For Windows users only: <a href="jmri4.9.3.shtml">JMRI 4.9.3</a> (and all later) has a new 
    version of the "LaunchJMRI.exe" program.  It's used to set options as
    JMRI is starting up, and is a completely normal part of JMRI.  Because it's
    new and different, however, your anti-virus program may reject it. 
    You might get a message about "file removed" or "file quarantined" or similar
    and then JMRI might not start.
    The solution is to make sure that your anti-virus program doesn't interfere
    with JMRI's installation and running. There are so many of those, unfortunately,
    that we can't really provide useful instructions beyond that.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.9.2.shtml">JMRI 4.9.2</a></span>
    JMRI saves the Uhlenbrock connection's "baud" rate as an Internationalized string, 
    and, upon loading a configuration profile, requires an Internationalized "baud" 
    rate in the .XML file.  JMRI will fail to properly configure the serial port if the
    "baud" rate from the configuration profile does not match one of the baud rate 
    strings for the current Internationalization "locale".  If you experience problems 
    where JMRI start-up of a Uhlenbrock-based connection does not configure the serial 
    port, it may be necessary to edit the connection's preferences, select the 
    appropriate "baud" rate, save the connection.  This updates the configuration profile 
    XML file to use one of the "baud" rate strings expected by the Uhlenbrock-specific 
    code in JMRI.  It is necessary to re-start JMRI for this change to take effect.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.6.shtml">JMRI 4.7.6</a></span>
    If you're having trouble getting your DCC programmer to work, try
    checking that the "Defaults" under "Preferences" are set to your
    hardware system.
    The reason: This version of JMRI (and all later) provides more options for
    "default systems": If you have multiple sets of hardware attached, which
    should be used for throttles, for programming, etc.  JMRI tries to 
    guess the right settings for these when you upgrade to this version, but 
    apparently it sometimes gets that wrong (we haven't been able to track
    that down yet). Setting them manually fixes any wrong guesses.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.3</a></span> 
    This release will not start cleanly if installed over certain earlier versions of JMRI (the Windows installer ensures
    this is not an issue). Remove the JAR files <em>jackson-annotations-2.0.6.jar</em>, <em>jackson-core-2.0.6.jar</em>,
    and <em>jackson-databind-2.0.6.jar</em> from the <em>lib</em> directory within the previous installation directory to resolve
    this.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span>
    JMRI no longer supports the portable paths <code>resource:</code> or <code>file:</code> that
    were deprecated in JMRI 2.13. When loading a panel, an error message will be displayed
    if the panel contains a path that starts with <code>resource:</code> and the panel will
    not load until changed using an external editor. Paths starting with <code>file:</code>
    cannot be automatically flagged because JMRI allows file: URLs; these will have to 
    be changed manually.
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span><a id="validate" name="validate"/>
    When loading a panel file, JMRI applications now check the file's syntax and contents.
    This process is called "XML validation"
    If validation fails, an error message is shown
    that should explain the error, allowing it to be fixed using an editor. (The
    explanations remain a work in progress.) If you have a problem loading a
    panel file, please
    <ol>
        <li>Configure your JMRI startup to first run the 
            <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/TurnOffXmlValidation.py">jython/TurnOffXmlValidation.py</a>
            script which will suppress the error. This script needs to be run
            before your panel is loaded.
        <li>Write out a new version of the panel file (after saving a backup!)
        <li>Use that new version from now on.
        <li>And drop use of the jython/TurnOffXmlValidation.py script.
    </ol>

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span>
    This and future releases of JMRI may not function on OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. OS X
    operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
    user's group.
    To remove Java SE 6 from OS X, follow these steps (these steps assume
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>, if not,
      adjust the following paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command <code>/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh</code> It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
          It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
        </li>
      <li><em>El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span>
    Support for directly executing AppleScript within JMRI has been removed
    due to changes in macOS and Java outside our control. If you require the
    ability to use AppleScript, you may be able to add this capability on your
    own by visiting <a href="https://jmri.github.io/applescript">JMRI
      AppleScript Support</a>, but please be aware that this may not work
    on upcoming releases of macOS or Java.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.1.shtml">JMRI 4.5.1</a></span> 
    Internal turnouts and sensors need to have complete, individual system names.
    The names "IT" and "IS" (without any suffix) are no longer permitted:
    "IT12" is fine, but just "IT" is not. Most panel files that contain these should
    automatically migrate them to new names when saved, but in some cases you might need to manually update them.
