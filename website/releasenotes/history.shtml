      What are the differences between the various JMRI applications?
      </h2>

	<p><em>"What's past is prolog..."</em></p>

	<p>Originally, JMRI was a library project, and JmriDemo was just a 
	little driver program that would let you test the library.</p>

	<p>Since my layout at that time was LocoNet based, I wrote some tools 
	for LocoNet.  A couple people asked for copies of them, but were 
	confused by JmriDemo's references to tools for NCE, etc.  The 
	preferences system in the code back then wasn't very smart, so there 
	was no easy way to have just tools that work with the current system 
	appear. So I created the LocoTools application to bundle the 
	LocoNet-specific tools together.</p>

	<p>Then the idea for DecoderPro came along from Mark Gurries and Dave 
	Falkenburg.  It started as menu items in JmriDemo, but soon people 
	wanted a _program_ by that name, so one was created. Over time, the 
	menus in DecoderPro have changed a lot.  The original idea was that 
	_only_ decoder-related items would be there, to reduce confusion. But 
	people would request that other things be put there:  First control 
	over power, then turnouts (to flip the turnout to put the loco onto 
	the programming track), then throttles, etc.  About eight months ago, 
	that was stripped back down, but people wanted the stuff added back, 
	so it was.</p>

	<p>At last summer's NMRA convention, a couple people suggested that the 
	panel tools needed a program of their own, so PanelPro was created. 
	(And that gave a place to put the cool PanelPro logo!)</p>

	<p>With the addition of the preferences for adding your own buttons at 
	startup (and your own menu items if you dig a little deeper), the 
	differences between the various programs have really become quite 
	minor.</p>

	<p>Throughout, this has been an attempt to balance power and simplicity 
	for both new and experienced users.  I don't at all claim the current 
	situation is the right balance; suggestions are always welcomed, and 
	often acted upon.</p>
