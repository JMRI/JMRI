      Release Notes for JMRI 1.5.2 test release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: August 8, 2004</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.5.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier version.  As you'll see from the list of changes below, a lot of foundation code has been changed.  In particular, the C/MRI, EasyDCC and Lenz connections have had major rewrites, so your feedback will be greatly appreciated.

<p>This test release is part of a series that will eventually lead up to a production release called version 1.6; no date has been set for when that will happen.

<p>There was no public 1.5.1 test version; it was used for internal testing.


<h3>New warnings for this test version:</h3>

<p>The method for configuring the C/MRI protocol has changed.  If you use the C/MRI protocol, you will have to reconfigure your preferences the first time you run this version.

<h3>Download links:</h3>

<p>Please use these links for downloading, including the "?download" at the end. That adds to SourceForge's advertising statistics, which makes them happy to host our stuff.

<h3>Changes since production version 1.4:</h3>

<p>Many Javadoc warnings fixed.

<p>Kelley Loyd contributed EasyDCC Throttles

<p>David Duchamp added diagnostics to the C/MRI tools

<p>Jython scripting examples have been updated &amp; extended

<p>Major rewrite of the Lenz connection, which should be carefully tested.

<p>David Duchamp has added multi-node support for C/MRI. On the preferences window, after you select the "C/MRI" protocol, there will be a "Configure C/MRI nodes" button.  Push that, and you'll get a window for editing the configuration of your C/MRI node(s).  

<p>Alfredo Sola provided a Spanish translation

<p>C/MRI inputs are now debounced:  An input has to stay changed for two poll cycles to be visible.

<p>Panels now will show scroll bars if they are shrunk below their original size. Note that if you drag the panel to make it bigger, that larger size will be kept.

<p>Added simpler aliases for use in scripts.  You can now refer to the "state" of a turnout, sensor or signal head.

<p>Fix bug (#931470) where opening a protocol more than once in the preferences would result in duplicate entries in the selection boxes.

<p>Started to add direct serial output; not yet functioning at more than the initial level.

<p>Protected the "Send DCC Packet" tool against various bad input formats

<p>Various improvements to the LocoNet monitor to display more detail on some previously proprietary messages.

<p>Added an internal fast clock, based on the computer's system clock. There's a new "Clock" submenu in the Tools menu, which includes "Setup fast clock" and "Nixie clock".  "Setup fast clock" panel for controlling the fast clock, including letting you set the rate, time and run/stop.  "Nixie clock" is a cute little fast clock display, which shows the current fast time on Nixie tubes.

<p>Complete EasyDCC rewrite; fixes several bugs.

<p>Fix bug 927078 about the Throttle function popup menus and bug 932779 about unneeded output from the Throttle.

<p>Improve DccConsistManager handling of duplicates (Paul Bender)

<p>Panel editor can now be suppressed when opening a panel file by setting the "hide" attribute to "yes" in the XML file.  The default is not to hide.

<p>Jack Shall contributed a LE1035 definition and the new Lenz Ultra Drive family

<p>Michael Greene added the Lenz 51 file of "Lenz 4th gen BEMF decoders", including the LE030, LE040, LE130, LE135, and LE230.

<p>Added capability to specify min and max values for entries in a speed table (RFE 992975)

<p>Fix a bug where LocoNet sensors and turnouts discovered on the layout would have UNKNOWN state until the 2nd message (instead of the 1st message) was seen.

<p>Added two new data types to the code:  Reporter and Memory.  The first implementation of Reporter is Digitrax transponding.  By adding the appropriate elements to your panel files, you can show decoder ID information on your panels.  Memory objects are meant for scripting control; the first implementation is a MemoryIcon that lets you put a multi-state icon on the screen.  See xml/samples/MemoryIconExample.xml and samples/ReporterIconExample.xml for info on how to set this up.

<p>Made LocoBuffer II an explicitly available protocol, with the correct switch settings for the baud rate choices (RFE 930836)

<p>Add a warning on Mac OS X so people don't try to select the MS100 protocol.

<p>XML files are now written with a comment containing the JMRI version, data and
time.  This is meant to help us understand where all those files came from!

<p>Definitions for 5 Wangrow decoders were added.  Unfortunately, we don't have CV 7 values for any of these, so automatic identification won't work. If you use one of these definitions, please email in the CV7 value from your decoder(s).

<p>A new protocol was added for Intellibox direct serial connections.  See the JMRI Intellibox web page http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Uhlenbrock.html for details.

<p>Updated the configuration panel so all the Tools menu entries can now be selected for operation at startup, or added to buttons.

<p>Added a new "Thread Monitor" so that you can see which scripts are running, and kill those that you want to stop.

<p>Added a "License" menu item in the Help menu that displays the license under which JMRI is distributed.  I hate having to stress the legal aspects, but some of the commercial concerns are starting to become assertive about possibly demanding licensing fees from users of other products, and I've been advised to strengthen our legal position for the time when push comes to shove.

<p>SignalHead objects now have a separate "lit" parameter, in addition to a "DARK" appearance.  This also appears in a separate column in the SignalHead table. It is not yet integrated into the display icons, so a non-lit signal head will still show on the screen.
