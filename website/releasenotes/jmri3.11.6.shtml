<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
-->
<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2015.</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3 id="problems">Known problems with this release</h3>

<strong>OPERATIONS IS BROKEN IN THIS RELEASE. DO NOT USE VERSION 3.11.6 FOR OPERATIONS!</strong><br>
When reading the car file, there's a chance
that some cars won't be loaded at startup.<br>
Please use <a href="jmri3.11.7.shtml">JMRI 3.11.7</a> or later instead.

<!--
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri3.11.7.shtml">JMRI 3.11.7</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>This release, and all later releases in this cycle, require Java 1.8 or higher.
To use this or any later JMRI releases, you'll have to
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or higher.
</p>

<p>JMRI 3.11.3, and therefore this version, removes some files that were present in earlier versions.
Failure to remove these can result in some portions of
JMRI (notably the web server) failing to function correctly.
If you are updating an existing JMRI installation to this version on
<a href="../install/Linux.html#update">Linux</a>,
you must remove any older version of JMRI or unpack this
version of JMRI in an alternate location.
The recommended update procedures for JMRI on
<a href="../install/WindowsNew.shtml#update">Microsoft Windows (run the installer)</a>
and
<a href="../install/MacOSX.html#update">Mac OS X (open disk image and drag to final location, e.g. Applications folder)</a>
remove/replace the older version of JMRI, ensuring that these obsolete files are not
present.
</p>

<p>This release uses JDOM 2.0.5, which requires some code changes if you are directly
calling the parts of JMRI that interchange XML objects.</p>

<p>There are now separate settings for the default Service Mode Programmer and
for the default Ops Mode Programmer.  If you're using two or more system connections,
this lets you use one connection for ops mode (on track) programming and another connection
for your programming track. If you're using two separate connections, you
should go to the Defaults pane on the Preferences window and check that those
defaults were set properly.</p>

<p> If you are making a direct connection to a Intellibox unit via
    serial or USB, you will have to reselect your preferences.
    See the
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Uhlenbrock.shtml">Uhlenbrock support page</a>
    for instructions.</p>

<p> If you are using an NCE USB adapter, you will have to reselect your preferences
     the first time you use a JMRI 3.11 version (if you set them using JMRI 3.10 or earlier).
    See the
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/nce/NCE.shtml">page on configuring JMRI for NCE</a>
    for instructions.</p>

<p>The Save button in the Preferences window now only prompts for restarts if required.
There may be instances when pressing save incorrectly fails to prompt to restart JMRI or
prompts to restart JMRI when it should not.</p>

<p>Because of internal code changes, this version of JMRI may not be compatible with
<a href="http://cats4ctc.org"><!-- was http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/ --> CATS 2.34</a> or earlier.  Keep using
<a href="jmri3.10.shtml">JMRI 3.10</a> with CATS until there's a CATS update that
says it will work with JMRI 3.11.</p>

<p>The XmlIO web service has been removed. All users who were relying on the
XmlIO API are recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle
users are recommended to begin using webThrottle instead, or invest in devices
that can support webThrottle, the iOS WiThrottle, or the Android Engine
Driver.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.11.5:</h3>

<h4>Hardware Support</h4>
    <h5>MRC</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Ken Cameron added support for inverting turnouts on MRC systems.
        </ul>

    <h5>SPROG</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a problem where DecoderPro's read buttons would be disabled if using SPROG while JMRI is configured with multiple hardware interfaces.
        </ul>

<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>
	<p>Dave Heap made the following changes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Improved the reliability of "Read type from decoder" by retrying several times in the event of a (possibly transient) read failure.</li>
		<li>A single decoder model can now match multiple Product IDs, specified as a comma-separated list in the "productID" attribute.</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>ESU</h5>
	<p>Dave Heap made the following changes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Most modern ESU decoders will now be identified with "Read type from decoder".</li>
		<li>Renamed and consolidated models to conform to ESU practice. Old model names are still recognised but not shown. They can be updated via "<a href="/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoderAdvanced.shtml#update" target="_blank">Update Decoder Definitions</a>".</li>
		<li>Preliminary support for ESU LokSound L V4.0.</li>
		<li>Other improvements and corrections to the ESU decoder definitions.</li>
	</ul>

    <h5>MRC</h5>
	<p>Alain Le Marchand made a complete overhaul of the MRC Sound decoders:
	<ul>
		<li>Renamed all models in a consistent way. Rearranged families by scale. Old model names are still recognised but not shown. They can be updated via "<a href="/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoderAdvanced.shtml#update" target="_blank">Update Decoder Definitions</a>".</li>
		<li>Dispatched all CVs previously displayed on "MRC" pane to the relevant standard panes.</li>
        <li>Fixed several definitions and aligned to the documentation available on MRC web site.</li>
        <li>Added new definitions for: 1660 (N Life-Like C-Liner), 1817 and 1818 (G Diesels), 1822 (S Diesel), 1828 (N Atlas SD50/60), 1907 (HO Atlas S2/S4), 1911 (HO Steam), 1913 (HO Diesel), 1956 (N Steam), 1958 (N Kato PA1), 1959 (N Diesel), 1960 (N Kato SD45/SD70MAC/AC4400)</li>
	</ul></p>

    <h5>Miscellaneous</h5>

	<p>Digikeijs (Digirails): Added definition for Function decoder DR80015 (Alain Le Marchand)</p>
	<p>Hornby: Added definitions for Hornby TTS Class 37 and Class 40 (Nigel Cliffe)</p>
	<p>Trix: Added definitions for Trix Sound HO BR V160 and BR 41 (Alain Le Marchand)</p>

<h4>Operations</h4>
   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>New feature, car summary by track for Switch Lists. The summary shows by track all of
     the car pulls and set outs. It also shows the hold cars for each track. Now your operators will
     know by track all of the pulls needed for all trains and which cars need to stay put. Should be
     useful for the larger switch jobs. The summary is only available if you're running the switch
     list in real time.</li>
     <li>The train's description now has the option to include the lead engine's road name.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Paul Bender updated support for IdTag readers in Operations.  Rolling 
   Stock location and last moved date will now be automatically updated when
   an IdTag associated with the piece of rolling stock is seen by a reader 
   associated with a location.</p>

<h4>Preferences</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow startup files to be edited in the DecoderPro 3 preferences dialog.</li>
  </ul>


<h4>Warrants</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Fix several bugs recently introduced in record learn mode warrants.</li>
    <li>Add feature to display warrant routes graphically for review when multiple routes
        are possible.</li>
   </ul>


<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Debugging improvements in the Programmer support.</li>
    <li>Minor performance improvements in programmer selection widgets.</li>
	<li>ARM version detection has been improved on Linux so that
		ARMv5, ARMv6 and ARMv7 are correctly identified. This means that
		for RaspberryPi, no library file copy modifications are required. (Matthew Harris)</li>
