      Release Notes for JMRI 3.11.10 release
      </h2>

    <p>Date: July 05, 2015</p>
    <p>From: Matthew Harris</p>
    <p>Subject: Test version 3.11.10 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>-->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2015.</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at release time.

<!--
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.1.1.shtml">JMRI 4.1.1</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>This release, and all later releases in this cycle, require Java 1.8 or higher.
To use this or any later JMRI releases, you'll have to
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or higher.
</p>

<p>The old DecoderPro has been removed from the distribution package and
    DecoderPro 3 has been promoted to be the only available DecoderPro version.
    Existing custom launchers that launched the old DecoderPro should continue
    to function without change or issue.
    If you absolutely cannot use the new DecoderPro user interface, we suggest
    using PanelPro instead, as with the exception of a different icon and
    different fixed buttons on the main window, PanelPro has an identical
    user interface to the old DecoderPro.</p>

<p>JMRI 3.11.3, and therefore this version, removes some files that were present in earlier versions.
Failure to remove these can result in some portions of
JMRI (notably the web server) failing to function correctly.
If you are updating an existing JMRI installation to this version on
<a href="../install/Linux.html#update">Linux</a>,
you must remove any older version of JMRI or unpack this
version of JMRI in an alternate location.
The recommended update procedures for JMRI on
<a href="../install/WindowsNew.shtml#update">Microsoft Windows (run the installer)</a>
and
<a href="../install/MacOSX.html#update">Mac OS X (open disk image and drag to final location, e.g. Applications folder)</a>
remove/replace the older version of JMRI, ensuring that these obsolete files are not
present.
</p>

<p>This release uses JDOM 2.0.5, which requires some code changes if you are directly
calling the parts of JMRI that interchange XML objects.</p>

<p>There are now separate settings for the default Service Mode Programmer and
for the default Ops Mode Programmer.  If you're using two or more system connections,
this lets you use one connection for ops mode (on track) programming and another connection
for your programming track. If you're using two separate connections, you
should go to the Defaults pane on the Preferences window and check that those
defaults were set properly.</p>

<p> If you are making a direct connection to a Intellibox unit via
    serial or USB, you will have to reselect your preferences.
    See the
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Uhlenbrock.shtml">Uhlenbrock support page</a>
    for instructions.</p>

<p> If you are using an NCE USB adapter, you will have to reselect your preferences
     the first time you use a JMRI 3.11 version (if you set them using JMRI 3.10 or earlier).
    See the
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/nce/NCE.shtml">page on configuring JMRI for NCE</a>
    for instructions.</p>

<p>The Save button in the Preferences window now only prompts for restarts if required.
There may be instances when pressing save incorrectly fails to prompt to restart JMRI or
prompts to restart JMRI when it should not.</p>

<p>Because of internal code changes, this version of JMRI may not be compatible with
<a href="http://cats4ctc.org"><!-- was http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/ --> CATS 2.34</a> or earlier.  Keep using
<a href="jmri3.10.shtml">JMRI 3.10</a> with CATS until there's a CATS update that
says it will work with JMRI 3.11.</p>

<p>The XmlIO web service has been removed. All users who were relying on the
XmlIO API are recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle
users are recommended to begin using webThrottle instead, or invest in devices
that can support webThrottle, the iOS WiThrottle, or the Android Engine
Driver.</p>
