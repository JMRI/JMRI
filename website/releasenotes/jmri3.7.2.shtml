      Release Notes for JMRI 3.7.2 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: Feb 16, 2014</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.7.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.8 production release around the middle of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

This release has some changes to the application-initialization structure, particularly in the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/apps/Apps.html">apps.Apps</a> class.  If you have written code of your own
that runs applications based on JMRI, please check for use of deprecated methods.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>The internals for handling CV read and write addressing have been extensively 
reworked.  The change should be transparent (invisible) to users. If you do notice anything 
problems involving CV reading, writing, storage or anything else, please let us know.</p>

<p>The configuration structure for JMRI is changing to use <em>Configuration
Profiles</em>. Configuration Profiles allow a single JMRI application to have
multiple, user selectable, configurations that can be changed as application
startup. For some users, this change will have no impact; other users will be
visibly impacted by this change. See <a
href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/profiles.shtml">http://jmri.org/help/en/html/profiles.shtml</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>The JMRI SRCP implementation is undergoing extensive revision, in part
due to testing with 3rd party SRCP clients and servers.  If you are using the SRCP support, you will need to upgrade both the client(s) and the server to the same JMRI version.</p>

<p>The JMRI Web Server is being extensively rewritten. Some functionality has been temporarily lost while this rewrite continues.</p>

<P>This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6 or newer.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<p>Do not use this release for programming any ESU Select or V4.0 decoder. 
Instead, please use <a href="jmri3.7.7.shtml">test release 3.7.7</a> or later.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.7.1:</h3>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Made some improvements to car routing and build report messages.</li>
    <li>You can now configure the build report to always preview, saves paper! See Build Report
     Options under Trains-&gt;Tools.</li>
    <li>The program now blocks a kernel for your manifests and switch lists (a group of cars)
     by the order that you add cars to the kernel.</li>
    <li>New checkbox option for the Cars window. Under Tools in the Cars window are two new
     options, one shows the checkboxes, and the other resets the ones showing in the window. Useful
     if your doing an audit of your cars using a PC or portable device. Great for those that don't
     like to waste paper!</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Enzo Fortuna improved the Italian translation.</p>

<p>Matthew Harris updated the user interface font size change preference to no longer override the underlying font style.</p>

<p>Dave Heap made the following changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved the display of file locations under the Help menu.</li>
    <li>Improved the ESU V4/Select decoder definitions.</li>
    <li>Added some more NCE menu items to the list of available startup actions and buttons.</li>

    <li>Fixed issues with item state colour coding with OS X and Nimbus display GUIs.</li>
    <li>Added the ability to import LokProgrammer CV value list files.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Peter Ulvestad updated the clinics information.</p>

<p>Resolved an issue that caused some CVs to be skipped in Read Full Sheet operations. Particularly noticeable with ESU V4 decoders.</p>


<p>The Web server has been extensively updated by Randall Wood and Steve Todd:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The static index.html has been replaced with a home servlet responding to / and /index.html</li>
	<li>The home, panels, and operations servlets have been updated with a new <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> user interface.</li>

</ul>


<p>Steve Todd made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fixed a WiThrottle read loop that could cause high CPU usage when devices were "lost".</li>

import each roster entry.  If there's already an entry with the same name (ID), you'll
be asked if you want to replace it.
