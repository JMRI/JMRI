      Release Notes for JMRI 3.9.3 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: September 13, 2014</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.9.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>
<p>RFID support has been changed to allow for additional protocols - existing
   CORE-ID readers <em>should</em> remain unaffected but, in certain
   circumstances, it may be necessary to update connection configuration with 
   the correct protocol.</p>

<p>The activation.jar library is no longer included with the JMRI download.
This shouldn't have any impact on you, but it's remotely possible that it
might impact you if you have your own Java code that you're combining with JMRI
and/or you're still using a Java version before Java 1.6.
(Scripts and panel files will not be impacted.)</p>

<p>Images associated with roster entries are now saved to the roster directory instead of
the resources directory when added to the roster entry. Existing images are not moved.</p>

<p>The JMRI 3.9.* releases series, including this one, and JMRI 3.10 (expected in December 2014),
will be the last JMRI releases that will work with Java 1.6.  
To use any later JMRI test or production releases, you'll have to 
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or later.
All JMRI releases 3.9.3 and later are tested on Java 1.8, so you 
can do the Java update now if you want to.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<!-- keep this warning in place through the 3.11/3.12 development cycle -->
<p>The XmlIO web service has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in JMRI 3.11 (July 2015).
All users and developers who are relying on direct access to the XmlIO API are
recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle users are recommended to
begin using webThrottle instead, or to plan on investing in devices that can support
webThrottle, <a href="http://www.withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a> for iOS, or
<a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org">Engine Driver</a> for Android.</p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<p>None at the time of this release.</p>

<h3>Download links:</h3>

<!-- 
<p>During development leading to the actual release, you can find test download files on the

Preliminary build files (not the final released files) can be found
on the

<h3>Changes since test release 3.9.2:</h3>

<p>
The Speedometer now handles international format input.  If you live in a place where
decimal numbers are written like "1,3" and JMRI is set to that locale
(see the Locale section on <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Display">this page</a>), 
then you can use commas for the decimal mark when inputting the distances.
We'll be updating more parts of JMRI to do this in the future.

<p>
The AAR-1946 and B&amp;O-1957 signal system definitions had some internal problems fixed.
This shouldn't cause any problems for people using them, but we can't be 100% certain.
If you're using these, please check to make sure your signals are still working OK, 
and let us know if they're not.

<p>Removed the activation.jar library, along with various references to loading it.
This is no longer needed since JMRI now requires Java 1.6 or later.</p>

<h4>System Support</h4>
    <p>Some improvements to the support for MRC command stations
    via the Prodigy USB computer interface.</p>

    <p><b>This is the first series of JMRI to support the Roco Z21 command stations
    via its built in network connection.</b></p>

    <h5>RFID</h5>

    <h5>OpenLCB</h5>

<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>
    <p>Much work on improving the structure of the files, which has resulted in some 
    internal changes.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Improvements to the Italian translation.</p>
    <p></p>    
    <p>Added Digitrax SFX006 &amp; DN166I2B definitions (Alain Le Marchand)</p>  
    <p>Added Soundtraxx Tsunami definitions for:
    <ul>        
    <li>Bowser PCC Streetcar. Can be found in the "Tsunami Diesel Bowser OEM" family (Alain Le Marchand).</li>
    <li>Diesel TSU-IM1000 (828070, 828071, 828074), TSU-GN1000 GEVO-12 (828059), TSU-KT1000 P42 (828068) (Alain Le Marchand).</li>    
    </ul>
    <p>Added MyLocoSound DCC decoder definitions (Alain Le Marchand)</p>      
    <p>Robin Becker updated the Tam Valley Depot Quad-LN_S stationary decoder to add a Reset menu item when using the Service Mode programmer.</p>
    <p>Dave Heap made the following changes to the Function Map:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Added the ability to specify (f) or (r) suffixes for functions other than FL (see the <a href="/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/FnMapping.shtml" target="_blank">Function Map</a> page).</li>
    <li>Added auto-generated tooltips for checkboxes (see the <a href="/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/FnMapping.shtml" target="_blank">Function Map</a> page).</li>
    <li>Unused rows or columns are now automatically suppressed.</li>
    <li>Increased flexibility of column naming, including the ability to suppress display of a column (see this <a href="/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/symbolicprog/FnMapPanel.html" target="_blank">Javadoc page</a>).</li>
    <li>Improved the warning displayed in the ESU Function Map pane if using the Mac OS X and Java 1.6 combination.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h4>Scripting</h4>
   <ul>
   	<li>in AbstractAutomaton (used by some scripting) provide for timeout value when throttle not acquired, 
	default to 30 seconds (Steve Todd)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Operations</h4>
    <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Improved how the alternate track feature works. You can now use the alternate track
     feature without schedules or custom loads. Note that if you specify an alternate for a spur,
     only cars destined for that spur will be placed on the alternate track.</li>
    <li>New feature, random moves for any location in a train's route. In the route edit window
     you will find a new column labeled "Random" with a menu of 10 items, The default is "Off" or
     disabled, and there are values between 10 and 100. If you select 10, it tells the program to
     randomly reduce the number of cars moves at the location by up to 10%. So if you asked for 10
     moves, you could get 10 or 9 moves. If you selected 50, you could get any number of moves
     between 10 and 5. If you select 100, you could get any number of moves between 10 and 0. Be
     sure and press "Save" after you make your selection.
     <li>New feature, the ability to copy a location.  See under "Tools" in the Locations window.
     <li>Fixed a bug where cars out of staging used the same schedule item, even if the schedule was in
     sequential mode.  Thanks to Dave Cochrun for identifying and helping us debug this problem.
   </ul>

   <h4>JSON and Web Throttles</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Improved the ability for a JSON or Web Throttle client that has unexpectedly
	dropped its connection to regain control of the throttle before JMRI automatically
	stops the train. (Randall Wood)</li>
	<li>JSON or Web Throttle clients that request a throttle for the same DCC address or
	roster entry will share a throttle even if the supporting DCC system does not allow
	multiple throttles per address. (Randall Wood)</li>
	<li>Web Throttles only display function buttons that have labels assigned to them.
	(Randall Wood)</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Images added to a roster entry are now stored within the roster directory instead
	of the resources directory. (Randall Wood)</li>
	<li>If multiple profiles are selected, only those actions that apply to multiple
	profiles are available. (Randall Wood)</li>
	<li>Clicking anywhere on the profile selection dialog cancels automatically starting
	with the last used profile. (Randall Wood)</li>
	<li>Changed the upload debugging info functions to now use SourceForge mailing 
	list. This should avoid problems previously seen when attempting to access
	previous mailing list directly. (Matthew Harris)</li>
