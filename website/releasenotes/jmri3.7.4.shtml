      Release Notes for JMRI 3.7.4 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: April 20, 2014</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.7.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.8 production release around the middle of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>The XmlIO web service has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in JMRI 3.11.
All users who are relying on direct access to the XmlIO API are
recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle users are recommended to
begin using webThrottle instead, or to plan on investing in devices that can support
webThrottle, the iOS WiThrottle, or the Android Engine Driver.</p>

<p>We are starting to update the format of the decoder definition files starting with this
version.  There will be additional changes in 3.7.5.  Please, if you want to contribute
decoder file updates, start with the files in this version or (ideally) straight from
SVN.  Older versions will be hard to merge.</p>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>This release has some changes to the application-initialization structure, particularly in the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/apps/Apps.html">apps.Apps</a> class.  If you have written code of your own
that runs applications based on JMRI, please check for use of deprecated methods.

<p>The internals for handling CV read and write addressing have been extensively 
reworked.  The change should be transparent (invisible) to users. If you do notice anything 
problems involving CV reading, writing, storage or anything else, please let us know.</p>

<p>The configuration structure for JMRI is changing to use <em>Configuration
Profiles</em>. Configuration Profiles allow a single JMRI application to have
multiple, user selectable, configurations that can be changed as application
startup. For some users, this change will have no impact; other users will be
visibly impacted by this change. See <a
href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/profiles.shtml">http://jmri.org/help/en/html/profiles.shtml</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>The JMRI SRCP implementation is undergoing extensive revision, in part
due to testing with 3rd party SRCP clients and servers.  
If you are using the SRCP support, 
you will need to upgrade both the client(s) and the server to the same JMRI version.</p>

<p>The JMRI Web Server is being extensively rewritten. 
Some functionality has been temporarily lost while this rewrite continues.</p>

<p>This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6 or newer.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<p>There is a known problem with certain TCS and perhaps ESU decoders that will be fixing in JMRI 3.7.5.</p>
<p>Do not use this release for programming any ESU Select or V4.0 decoder. 
Instead, please use <a href="jmri3.7.7.shtml">test release 3.7.7</a> or later.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.7.3:</h3>

<p>You can now open a PanelPro- or Decoderpro-style main window from the DecoderPro3 files menu,
complete with the full menus you'd find if you were running PanelPro or DecoderPro from scratch.

<p>Lou DeHayes provided a fix for the Digitrax DS54 decoder definition.</p>

<p>Dave Heap made the following changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Informative tooltips on the ESU Function Map pane.</li>
    <li>Corrections and other improvements to existing ESU decoder definitions.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem with printing CVs for some decoders.</li>
    <li>Restored the ability to specify a fnmapping element by either output number OR name.</li>
    <li>Added an optional "(alt)" suffix to a fnmapping element.</li>
    <li>Added a live Function Group Exchange feature on the Function Map pane for two sample Tsunami decoders (Diesel Genesis OEM and Steam Genesis OEM).</li>
    <li>Added the facility to define "soundlabels" (like "functionlabels") in the decoder definition files.</li>
    <li>Can now add "functionlabels" and "soundlabels" to individual models in the decoder definition files. These override corresponding labels at the family level.</li>
    <li>Added a "soundlabel" element to the pane programmer, allowing sound labels to be displayed on panes.</li>
    <li>(A "functionlabel" pane element and user-editable sound labels are planned for the next release.)</li>
  </ul>

This is in addition to the existing "Open Power Controller" option.

<p>Dispatcher - The delay trigger when running automatically is now correctly obeyed when using SignalMast Logics - KD
<p>Layout Editor - Added a scroll bar to the top edit panel
 
<p>Some improvements to the tooltips on the decoder selection window suggested by Alan Le Marchand.


   <p>Enzo Fortuna improved the Italian translation
   
   <p>Daniel Boudreau made the following improvements to Operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Better routing out of staging for cars with custom loads or final destinations. The
     latest changes should reduce the chances of a build failure for cars in staging that used the
     Return When Empty feature.</li>
    <li>You can now specify a custom load when using the Return When Empty (RWE) feature for a
     car.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue with Classification / Interchange tracks that have destination
     restrictions. Now if a car without a final destination is placed on a C/I track with
     destination restrictions, the program will only forward cars to that destination.</li>
    <li>Made some improvements to the train build report.</li>
    <li>Added three more manifest color options; orange, yellow, and gray.</li>
    <li>Improved the tabular format with regards to rolling stock locations and track names.</li>

     destination shown in the Cars window.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Ken Cameron has provided:</p>
   <ul>
   	<li>Added support for NMRA signal decoders on NCE-USB connected systems.</li>
