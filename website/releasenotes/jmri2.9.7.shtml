<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the seventh in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.10 production release in Summer 2010. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>Multiple improvements to throttles
<li>Improved LocoNet ID monitoring
<li>Improved support for multiple LocoNet connections
</ul>
along with other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None for this version)

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

Panel files written with JMRI 2.9.6 or later that contain Lights 
will not be readable by earlier versions of JMRI.

<p>
JMRI system names start with two capital letters, e.g. LT10 or NS23 or PLA5.
Past versions have tried to cope when people enter lower cases letters,
e.g. lt10 or Ns23 or pLA5, with various degrees of success. 
Unfortunately, this code isn't compatible with some new systems that are
being working on, and we have to remove it.  Starting with this version,
JMRI requires that you enter consistent system names, including using the right case.
If you use system names, and haven't been using consistent names, you'll
probably have to practice a little to get in the habit. If you have any problems
reading old files, etc, please post a note on the JMRI Users group
and somebody will help you.

<p>
The LocoTools application is no longer supported, and is being removed.
Some parts of it are still present, but you should use e.g. PanelPro or
DecoderPro instead.  They can do everything that LocoTools can.

<p>
The preferences have been significantly reworked. In some cases,
preferences to add a button or do an action at startup may have to be 
deleted and re-entered before they will work.

<p>
The communications libraries for Mac OS X have been updated.  
We've tested these extensively, but there may be combinations of 
hardware and software versions that still aren't right.  If the program
can't see your layout connection, please post to the JMRI Users group
with what type of Mac you're using (PowerBook, PowerMac, MacBook, etc), 
processor type (PPC G3, G4, G5 or Intel) and Mac OS X version (10.4, 10.5, 
etc; names like Leopard are OK) too.  We've got several library versions 
and most likely have one that will work, we just have to figure out which.

<p>
If you're using a Lenz XPressNet connection, please
uncheck the "Check Buffer Status" box in the preference
pane where you selected the Lenz protocol.

<p>
This version of JMRI uses the new communications libraries introduced in 
<a href="jmri2.9.3.shtml">JMRI 2.9.3</a>.
On Windows, the installer should take care of all installation and deinstallation 
required.  On Linux, you may have to install and/or uninstall 
various communications library parts, see the
<a href="../install/Linux.html">JMRI Linux pages</a> for more info.
On Mac, depending on which version you were previously using you
may have to remove a communications library, see the
<a href="../install/MacOSX.html">JMRI Mac OS X page</a>.

<p>
You may get some messages like:
<code><pre>
WARNING:  RXTX Version mismatch
        Jar version = RXTX-2.2pre1
        native lib Version = RXTX-2.2pre2
</pre></code>
For now, this should be considered normal.  We'll try to get it
removed before the next production release. 

<p>
The JInput USB library was updated in  
<a href="jmri2.9.1.shtml">JMRI 2.9.1</a>, and again in
<a href="jmri2.9.1.shtml">JMRI 2.9.5</a>, which (should) 
have fixed problems on
Windows Vista, Intel Macs and some Linux machines.  We don't have a way to check this with all possible
input devices, so please check to make sure that your USB-attached devices still work.

<p>
When loading an older panel file containing signal head icons, you may
get WARN messages about "did not locate lunar icon file" and "did not locate flashlunar icon file".
To make these stop, just store the file again so that it's rewritten in the most recent format.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.9.6</h3>

The function mapping pane for Digitrax DH163 decoders was missing two rows (functions F7 and F8).
This has been fixed.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson made improvements to the jyninstrument throttle support for images, 
added a driver for "USB Game Pad 2"-type devices,
and added 
<a href="http://jmri.org/jython/Jynstruments/ThrottleFrame/VideoView.jyn/VideoView.py">support for a video input view</a>
in a frame inside a Throttle Window.

<p>
Dan Boudreau updated the operations print feature so you can now control which car attributes are printed.

<p>
Pete Cressman added an option to use local or global flag for positioning &amp; control of items in the panel editor(s).

<p>
Dan Boudreau added a "reset operations databases to default" feature to the operations support.

<p>
The LocoNet ID tool now displays multiple received IDs, so you can tell if all your UR90/UR91 receivers are set properly.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson added a work-around so that jynstrument customizations would work even if
the file was dropped instead of properly dropping the folder, and fixed a bug in finding the proper folders.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson fixed a problem with SPROG throttles.

<p>
Brett Hoffman added consist selection to the WiThrottle support.

<p>
When using multiple LocoNet connections, there's now a preference that lets you pick which one
will be used for CV programming.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson added a table in the DecoderPro "Roster Media" pane for updating roster attributes.

<p>
Pete Cressman improved the Warrant Table and OBlock Table
