<h3>Changes since production release 2.14</h3>

<p> Oscar Moutinho made the following updates to the inControl web throttle app:
   <ul>
      <li>Added Turnouts and Routes.</li>
	  <li>Power Off does not block throttle.</li>
	  <li>Some icons changed (used from /resources/icons/throttles/).</li>
   </ul>

<p> Matthew Harris made the following updates:
    <ul>
        <li>Updated the NetBeans project file to use JDK 1.6</li>
        <li>Updated the Windows installer to use JRE 1.6 and to
            no longer install on Windows 98 and ME</li>
    </ul>

<p>Walt Thompson fixed a problem causing panel files with tooltips to fail validation.


   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Removed accessory address restriction from NCE USB. Early versions of the NCE USB and
     PowerCab/SB3 were limited to 250, now they can support the entire accessory address range.</li>
    <li>Fixed localization issue where some of the menu items weren't displayed in the selected
     language.</li>
    <li>Improved the NCE command monitor by making the data captured human readable.</li>
    <li>Fixed the NCE turnout lock</li>
    <li>Fixed throttle when launched from Edit NCE Consist and the operations train icon.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the JMRI consist tool to now use the NCE command station when setting up a
     consist.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following enhancements and fixes to operations.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You no longer need a schedule to assign an alternate track to a spur. See "Alternate
     Track" under Edit Spur-&gt; Tools.</li>
    <li>Added to print locations the ability to analyze how your tracks are consumed by various
     car types.</li>
    <li>New switch list print option, you can now have a different car format for your switch
     list. See Print Options.</li>
    <li>The build reports can be read using a text editor. This feature was enabled by using
     Java 1.6. See Print Options.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the manifest printout for passenger trains. Now when you have a route comment
     and there isn't any work, only the location's name and route comment is printed.</li>
    <li>"Block cars by pick up location" is now disabled if you use one of the generate custom
     load features from staging.</li>
    <li>Added a new tool to help with custom loads and schedules. Now you can select a car type
     and load and see which spur with schedules will receive and ship that commodity. See under
     Tools "Show schedules by car type and load" in the Schedules window.</li>
    <li>Schedules in match mode now shows a hit count. The hit count is incremented every time
     a schedule's line item is used during a build.</li>
    <li>Improved the car import feature. Now the program can be told to automatically create
     new car types and adjust track lengths during the import. Saves a lot of time if your importing
     a lot of cars with new car types.</li>
    <li>Improved loco and caboose changes in a train's route. Now you can depart without a
     caboose and add one later in the route, or depart with a caboose and remove it in the route.</li>
    <li>The switch list button in the Trains window is now highlighted in red when changes
     occur to switch lists that have been printed.</li>
    <li>Now in aggressive mode, tracks in staging can be made available for an inbound train as
     soon as an outbound train is built. This allows a train to also depart and return to the same
     staging track. You need to enable this feature to use it, see Settings-&gt;Tools-&gt;Options
     select "Make departure track available after train is built".</li>
    <li>When a train departs from staging and also terminates into staging, the program will if
     needed generate a load for a car that will terminate into staging as long as one of the two
     "Generate custom loads ..." from staging is selected.</li>
    <li>New car feature "utility". This feature helps mimic prototype car movements of coal or
     other commodities. When a car is specified as a utility car, its road and number will not be
     displayed on the manifests or switch lists. Instead the program will list the required number
     of cars of a given type needed for the train. See the "Edit Car" window under Type for this
     feature.
    <li>Enhanced the operations "Edit Car" window. Now when you select Caboose, Passenger,
     Hazardous, or Utility, the program asks if you want to change all cars of that type.</li>
    <li>You can now edit the "hazardous" warning message, see Settings-&gt;Tools-&gt;Print
     Options.
    <li>Improved the train build report for several build failures</li>
    <li>Improved the "Set Cars" window, the program now remembers which "ignores" you
     previously selected.
    <li>In the "Edit Schedule" window, increased the maximum sequential car count in a schedule
     line item from 10 to 100.</li>
    <li>The schedule hit count in the "Edit Schedule" window now includes hits to a line item
     in sequential mode. Before the count would only increment if the schedule was in match mode.</li>
    <li>Some GUI improvements, now the program asks if you really want to delete a route,
     schedule or a train. You can now adjust and save the table column widths in the Edit Schedule
     and Edit Route windows.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the switch list printouts. You can now run the switch lists in two modes, real
     time which was the way it previously ran, and consolidation mode. Consolidation mode is great
     for folks with small railroads. Basically the program allows you to build and terminate your
     trains while capturing the switch list data for a location. See operations help for more info.
     Should save paper!</li>
    <li>New operations feature, train manifests are now truncated when there's a switch list
     for the location visited. A "truncated" manifest doesn't show where the cars are pulled from or
     where they are to be spotted. Local moves are also not shown. All of the removed info is
     however shown on the switch list for the location. This simplifies the train manifest showing
     only what is needed for the train's conductor. See Print Options and select the "Truncate"
     checkbox if you want to use this feature.</li>
    <li>New staging option, you can now have cars return to staging on a turn, rather than
     having a build failure. See help for more info, see Settings-&gt;Tools-&gt;Options "Allow cars
     to return to staging if needed"."
    <li>New operations feature, "Auto Save". When selected the program will automatically save
     your operation files. The program checks very minute to see if the operation files have been
     modified, and if so will save them when the next minute passes. See the "Setting" page for the
     "Auto Save" checkbox.
    <li>Switch lists now order the trains by their arrival time rather than their departure
     time from the start of their route.</li>
    <li>You can now manually add or delete cars from a built train using the "Set Cars" window.
     The train manifest will also show the changes you manually made to the train.</li>
    <li>In the "Trains" window, the program now shows the date and time a train was terminated.</li>
    <li>New operations feature, "Planned Pick Ups" found under "Tools" in "Edit Track" for
     spurs and interchanges. For each track you can tell the program that cars are expected to be
     picked up from the track and that cars currently sitting there should be ignored. See the
     operations help for more information.</li>
    <li>Two new switch list features. You can now eliminate trains that don't have work from
     your switch lists. You can if you wish use a separate page for each train visiting a location.
     See help for more info.</li>
    <li>You can now view a car's wait value in the Cars window. Note that you need a schedule
     for this field to show up.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the cars print and preview options. Now you can select the page orientation,
     and you can also optionally select the car's train, destination, and comment.</li>
    <li>You can now print all of your routes from the "Tools" menu found in the routes window.</li>
    <li>Improved the train builder, you should see less final destinations assigned to cars
     that aren't part of the train</li>
    <li>You can now add a unique switch list comment for each location.</li>
    <li>New feature, auto backup. When enabled, the program will make a backup copy of all
     operation files when the program starts.</li>
    <li>The Trains window now shows which staging track a train is departing or terminating on.</li>
    <li>New enhancement, you can now exclude trains or routes from spurs, interchanges, and
     staging tracks.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem introduced in 2.99.4 with the switch list button "Print Switch List
     Changes".</li>
    <li>The option "Print Valid" now also affects switch lists.</li>
    <li>Improved the way cars, locomotives, and routes windows resize.</li>
    <li>Switch lists now show the lead loco number as part of the train's name. The "Append
     Loco Number" must be selected in the Setting page.</li>
    <li>Now when building trains that visit locations that have the "same" name, cars are no
     longer moved between those locations unless a schedule is used. Locations with the "same" name
     are locations that use the hyphen followed by a number feature. Also improved trains manifests
     when "same" location names are used back to back.</li>
    <li>New operations feature, user can select a page size of 3.25" x 11" for hand held
     devices. See the Print Options page for detail.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Paul Bender added a new Generic Consist Manager which will be installed on systems such as the SPROG that implement a command station interface (the ability to send an arbitrary NMRA DCC packet).  This version of the Consist Manager uses an NMRA Consist Control packet to create the consist instead of the Operations Mode Programming request used in the previous Generic Consist Manager.  This will allow writing the consist address on decoders that support Operations Mode Programming, but do not allow operations mode programming of CV19 (Certain Lenz decoders fall into this category).

<p>Georgio Terdida fixed a bug that may occur when loading an XnTcp adapter.</p>

<p>Paul Bender fixed the port number display for network connection configurations.</p>

<p>Help pages with external links (e.g. full "http:" links) and of types that the JavaHelp browser
can't display are now sent to the user's default web browser for display.

<p>B. Milhaupt made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the configuration tools to provide more reliable OpSw accesses to 
Digitrax BDL16x, DS64, PM4x, and SE8c boards.  Some users reported that 
previous versions of these tools would abort during the middle of a Read or 
Write, when the addressed board would not provide the required response to 
the OpSw read or write message.  These tools will now attempt up to three 
accesses to an OpSw before aborting the OpSw operation, instead of making 
only one OpSw access attempt.</li>
