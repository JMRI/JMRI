<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>This is the first series of JMRI to support the MRC command stations
via the Prodigy USB computer interface.</b></p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>The XmlIO web service has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in JMRI 3.11 (July 2015).
All users who are relying on direct access to the XmlIO API are
recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle users are recommended to
begin using webThrottle instead, or to plan on investing in devices that can support
webThrottle, the iOS WiThrottle, or the Android Engine Driver.</p>

<p>The configuration structure for JMRI is changing to use <em>Configuration
Profiles</em>. Configuration Profiles allow a single JMRI application to have
multiple, user selectable, configurations that can be changed as application
startup. For some users, this change will have no impact; other users will be
visibly impacted by this change. See <a
href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/profiles.shtml">http://jmri.org/help/en/html/profiles.shtml</a>
for more information.</p>

<P>This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6 or newer.</p>

<h3>Changes since production release 3.8:</h3>

When you set a non-default location for script files under the preferences "location" tab, e.g. to put your scripts
in a common directory, that location can now be referenced via the "scripts:" portable prefix.  This will be applied
automatically to pathnames that are selected when defining Logix Conditional Actions and similar operations.
Note that if you select a location that <u>doesn't</u> contain the JMRI-supplied scripts, they won't be accessible
through the scripts: prefix, but still will be accessible using program:jython/ as a prefix.

<p>Suzie Tall improved icon support in the
