      Release Notes for JMRI 2.13.5 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: December 4, 2011</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.13.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>  -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.0 production release.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

None yet

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

The way in which UserNames are edited in the tables changed in JMRI 2.13.1, renames are now performed via a mouse pop-up menu and can not be directly edited.

<p>
The method we use for building release files was extensively changed with JMRI 2.13.1. Please let us know of any problems
with installation or unpacking.

<p>This release of "DecoderPro 3" is a test.  There are a few more features we'd
like to add, but before doing that we need feedback from users; does it work for
you, what do you want to see changed, etc. We'll look at all the information
which comes back and incorporate it in future developments.
We have tested "DecoderPro 3" and are not expecting major file-damaging faults.
But with any test-release of software there is always a small risk that
something has been overlooked.  So, please check that you have a backup of your
Roster files just in case something unexpected happens.  If you install with the
Windows installer, a backup copy of your old files (including the roster) is
created by default.</p>

<p>
JMRI 2.12 is the last release which is completely supported by Java 1.5.
Starting with this release, there will be minor interface features, such as 
drag-and-drop of some items, that require your computer to have Java 1.6 installed.
Computers with only Java 1.5 will still be able to use JMRI, including PanelPro and DecoderPro,
through the end of this 2.13.* release cycle.  Releases in the next cycle
will require Java 1.6.


<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since test release 2.13.4</h3>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following enhancements to operations.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You can now request that when building a train to use normal mode. Useful if your train
     is departing staging and you prefer that all cars in staging be set out before other cars in
     the train's route.</li>
    <li>Fixed a minor bug in conductor window. Previously if the conductor window was open and
     a new train was built, the window status would sometimes show 0 cars 0 length 0 tons when
     departing a location without any work.</li>
     <li>When manually placing a car at a spur with a schedule, the program now will ask if you want to apply
     the schedule to the car.</li>
     <li>If you reduce the maximum train length in the settings window, the program now checks all of your routes
     to see if any of your locations has a departure train length greater than the new length you just entered.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Steve Todd made the following enhancements to the Mini Web Server:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The /frame/[frame-name].html pages (formerly /panel/[frame-name].html) now use ajax for
     smoother image refresh and clicking. A new preference was added to allow this feature to be
     turned off (e.g. for older browsers).</li>
    <li>A couple of widgets did not work correctly when clicked in the web browser.  These have been fixed.</li>
    <li>Now clicks properly on zoomed LE panels.</li>
   </ul>

   <p> Paul Bender has made the following updates/bug fixes in the LocoNet
   Consist Manager:
   <ul>
      <li>The direction checkboxes now function properly</li>
      <li>The reverse button now has some function, though there is a known issue with loosing the lead address</li>
   </ul>
   
  <p> Kevin Dickerson has made the following updates
   <ul>
      <li>Deprecated the LocoNet ALM code as it is believed to no longer be used and has bugs that have been un-reported</li>
      <li>Added a Method to generate Entry Exit routes using the Layout Editor, so that only a source and destination sensor
        needs to be made active and the turnouts between the two points will automatically be set.</li>
      <li>Added an option into Blocks, to set the direction of traffic flow to neighboring blocks, this is mainly used with 
      the SignalMast logic and Entry Exit pairs, to help define sections of traffic that only work in one direction.</li>
      <li>Added the ability to set the permissive flag for a block from the Layout Editor block editor</li>
   </ul>

  <p> Dave Duchamp has made the following updates
   <ul>
      <li>Dispatcher - Stopping automatically running trains when using the 'Pause" action has been 
        improved.</li>
      <li>Transits - Fixed a bug that caused an exception when saving a panel containing a Transit with a missing 
        Section that a user had deleted.</li>
      <li>Sections - Added a new dialog to the Section Table informing the user if a Section the user is 
        proposing to delete is in use by Transits, and listing which Transits are using the Section.  The 
        user is given a choice of proceeding with the deletion, or cancelling.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Spectrum Engineering provided a decoder definition for their Animation Controller AC8824 accessory decoder.

<p>Jim Wouter provided an update for the sound levels and defaults in the MRC Sound Brilliance 1812 decoder definition.

<p>John Crellin provided a definition for the Kato FL11 decoder.

<P>Michael Mosher updated some QSI V7 and V8 decoder definitions. He also made a correction to the TD SRC16 definition.

<p>Jack Shall improved the Tsunami diesel definition to add a new variant and improve the Turbine definition

<p>Nigel Cliffe update CT and MERG decoder definitions
