	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.1.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. It is a rapid replacement
for JMRI 2.1.2, which had a problem (see below).  If you have JMRI 2.1.2
installed, it's recommended you replace it with this version.

<!-- It contains  -->
<!-- many new features, including: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li>Support for the X10 power adapters, -->
<!-- <li>improved consisting support, -->
<!-- <li>additional sounds and graphics for creating USS CTC panels, -->
<!-- <li>lots of additions to the help screens -->
<!-- <li>and several decoder definitions were added and improved. -->
<!-- </ul> -->
<!-- along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- <p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive. -->
<!-- They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.   -->
<!-- Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental. -->

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.1 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.2" available for download today. -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

This release was created shortly after JMRI 2.1.2 to fix a bad new bug accidentally introduced in 2.1.2: If you save a roster entry, you can't read the values back in.  This new 2.1.3 version both corrects the problem, so that files are properly written out, and is able to read the corrupted files that 2.1.2 writes.
<p>
If you did not install JMRI 2.1.2, there's nothing to worry about.
<p>
If you did install JMRI 2.1.2, please install this release promptly.

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

<p>
In JMRI 2.1.1, when you went to load a panel file, only files with a ".xml" filename suffix were shown by default. To see all files, you could select "All Files" in the window.  This caused some confusion because many people hadn't added the ".xml" suffix to their panel file names.  We still think having a suffix like that is valuable, but to reduce confusion in JMRI 2.1.2 when you save a panel file an ".xml" suffix is added automatically to the filename if you haven't already provided it.  This makes the filename filter work better when loading a file.  If you want to provide another suffix, or none at all, select the "All Files" option in the window before saving the file. 

<p>JMRI is moving toward requiring Java 1.4 or later.  Certain new features may not work if you are using an earlier
version of Java.  To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts. This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts. Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.
 
<p>The beginnings of support for the QSI Programmer device are present, but it's not complete yet

<h3>Changes since test version 2.1.2:</h3>

<p>
David Duchamp fixed a bug that was causing the analog fast clock to display the wrong rate.

<p>
Philip Middlemiss provided a decoder definition for the Hornby R8215 decoder.

<p>
Fixed a bad bug in JMRI 2.1.2 that caused newly written roster files to not be readable.  
The fix both writes files properly now, and can also read the improperly written ones from 2.1.2.
