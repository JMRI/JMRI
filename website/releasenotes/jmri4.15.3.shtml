      Release Notes for JMRI 4.15.3 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: February 12, 2019</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.15.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release during early Summer 2019.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.11.9 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running OK before
        updating to this test release.  Once you have JMRI 4.12 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been a number of 
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    you <u>must</u> 
    update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to this release.


<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If running on 64-bit Microsoft Windows with a 32-bit Java installation, JMRI will fail to launch.
        A workaround is to install a 64-bit Java (it's not required to uninstall the existing 32-bit Java).
        If you are unable to install a 64-bit Java, an alternate workaround is to modify the Start Menu shortcut Target
        by changing <pre>"C:\Program Files (x86)\JMRI\LaunchJMRI.exe" apps....</pre> to
        <pre>"C:\Program Files (x86)\JMRI\LaunchJMRI.exe" /32bit apps....</pre>
        This forces the launcher to only look for a 32-bit Java installation.
        This problem is being tracked via <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/6568">GitHub issue 6568</a>.</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.11.3.shtml">JMRI 4.11.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The prefix that identifies a layout connection should be a single letter, like "N" or "L",
        or a letter and some digits, like "K2" or "D3". Some older systems used to have
        longer "legacy system prefixes" like "DX", "DCCPP", "DP", "MR", "MC", "PI", and "TM".
        Those <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">legacy system prefixes</a>
        will now cause JMRI to issues a warning at startup. In this release, JMRI will
        still work with those prefixes, but they will need to be migrated to the proper form soon;
        JMRI 4.17.1 and later will <u>require</u> that this have been fixed.
        Therefore, this warning can't be suppressed
        without migrating the prefix in the connection configuration (and any associated
        panel files and scripts).
        If you're getting this warning and therefore need to do that migration,
        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">migration page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.14.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.14 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.15 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li><br>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li><br>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li><br>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li><br>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li><br>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>MERG CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Turnouts now accept DIRECT and DELAYED feedback.</li>
                <li>Querying a turnout will also query any feedback sensors for that turnout.<li>
                <li>Event Request monitoring has moved from the Event Table to a stand-alone request monitoring table.</li>
                <li>The CBUS console will attempt to lookup event ( and node ) names from the Event Table.</li>
            </ul>


    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed an issue where Reporters with a system letter of M

                <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">requiring migration</a>.</li>
            <li>RailCom Tags now appear in the ID Tag table and are available to operations and other tools just like other Identifiable tags.</li>
	    <li>LocoNet reporters now report a Transponding Tag object instead of a string.  This object allows extracting the address without further parsing.  As with RailCom tags, these also apear in the IdTag table and are available totools such as operations.</li>
	    <li>Internal Reporters can now collect information.  An example showing how to use this feature is <a href="https://github.com/pabender/Sensys2014">available here</a>.</li>
