      Release Notes for JMRI 1.3.11 developer release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: March 6, 2004</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.3.11 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for
      download.</p>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
	<ul>

	<li>This is a test release.</li>
	<li>Please post a note if you encounter any
	new or old bugs!</li>
	<li>Please back up your JMRI files before
	installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier
	version.</li>

	<li>Although there are many important items on the to-do lists, we also 
	need a new production version.  Please test this version thoroughly, 
	and post your results.  Unless new critical problems are found, this 
	will become the production version on April 2nd, 2004.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>New warnings:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Panel files written by this and later versions may not be readable 
	with versions before 1.3.0.  Older files will remain readable, but if 
	you edit them with this version and then store them, you might not be 
	able to read them if you go back to version 1.2.5.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Older warnings for the 1.3 series of test versions:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>There is no OS/2 version of this test release because our OS/2
	test machine is no longer online.  If you have a suitable OS/2
	machine and are willing to host our release testing, please let me
	know.</li>

	<li>If you are building your own copy of the program from the source
	code using Ant, please make sure to update the build.xml file.
	There have been some changes in the build procedure during the
	1.3.9 build.</li>

	<li>These downloads are significantly larger than version 1.3.5 and
	previous.  This is due to the addition of a help system starting in
	test version 1.3.8.</li>

	<li>LocoNet sensor numbering has been changed starting in version
	1.3.4!  This will effect people who have panel files (.xml files
	containing panel definition) for LocoNet block occupancy sensors.
	The sensor numbers now start with 1, not 0, so you'll have to edit
	the panel files to change e.g. LS0 to LS1, LS23 to LS24, etc.  This
	does not effect input via other (non-LocoNet) protocols, including
	C/MRI, NCE AIU, etc.  If you use LocoNet sensor numbers for the
	Speedometer, you'll have to increase them by one also.</li>

	<li>If you have pre-1.2.3 roster entries that use Zimo decoder
	definitions, you'll have to recreate them.  The Zimo decoder
	definitions have been completely reworked in a better organization
	starting with test version 1.2.3.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Changes since test version 1.3.10:</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>Added "Load Throttle" as one of the available buttons/startup
	actions in advanced preferences. Also added I8N to those items
	(only English at present), and made the mechanism easy to
	extend.</li>

	<li>Added example of creating your own button via a script
	(jython/JButtonExample.py)</li>

	<li>Various small improvements to panel load/store to improve
	robustness of storing signalling information</li>

	<li>"Simple Signal Logic" tool now allows a signal to drop red if
	any one of up to four blocks is occupied. Old panel files still
	work, but will be automatically rewritten in a new format when
	stored again.</li>

	<li>Fixed bug #912806: Read Sheet doesnt read CV7, CV8</li>

	<li>Fixed bug #879990: Changing Roster Entry pane fields doesn't
	set file-dirty</li>

	<li>Michael Green provided an update to the SoundTraxx LC Diesel
	PNP FX decoder definition to fix some misleading typos</li>

	<li>Michal Basta provided internationlization for the Czech
	language, so DecoderPro is not available in Czech both with and
	without diacritical marks.</li>

	<li>(Paul Bender) Improvements to handling of XPressNet input
	sensors.  Added a timeout for sending turnout "off" messages on
	certain Lenz systems.</li>

	<li>Added CV7, CV8 to the Digitrax DS54 programmer (Walt
	Thompson)</li>

	<li>Paul Bender fixed some problems with XpressNet throttles that
	first appeared in JMRI 1.3.10.  These included odd behavior in 128
	and 28 step mode, and the speed scale being wrong in 28 step
	mode.</li>

	<li>Nick Kulp contributed three new sets of signal icons, available at:
		<ul>
		<li>resources/icons/smallschematics/PRRsignals</li>
		<li>resources/icons/smallschematics/bordersearchlights</li>
		<li>resources/icons/smallschematics/RDG_Catface_Signals</li>
		</ul></li>

	<li>Michael Green provided new decoder definitions for the S Helper
	Service F3 and F7 DCC Sound decoders. These decoders were custom
	manufactured by SoundTraxx for S Helper Service's engines.</li>

	<li>The sample panel for Nick Kulp's PanelPro clinic is in the
	distribution at
	    <ul>
	     <li>xml/samples/NicksClinic.xml</li>
	     </ul>
	</li>

	<li>Paul Bender improved handling of XPressnet turnout and sensor
	messages for certain Lenz command stations.</li>

	<li>Windows installer no longer removes old files from the xml,
	resources and lib directories, so that user-added files will be
	kept.</li>
	</ul>
