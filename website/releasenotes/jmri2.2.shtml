<h3>Warnings and Notes:</h3>

The "Double Turnout" and "Triple Turnout" signals are now called
"Double Output" and "Triple Output" in an attempt to reduce confusion of new
users.  They still work the way they used to.

<p>
Starting in the 2.1.4 version, panels should not have duplicate names.  
The program assigns a unique default name to newly created panels, and will prevent you from renaming a panel to an existing name.
If you read a file containing a panel with a name that duplicates an existing panel's name, you'll get a warning message.
Depending on user reaction, this may become a dialog box that asks if you want to continue.

<p>
The scripts used to start the JMRI applications on Linux and Mac OS X have been extensively reworked.  
The new ones should do everything the old ones do, plus
<a href="http://jmri.org/install/ShellScripts.shtml">more</a>.  
Please keep an eye out for new problems, however, and don't hesitate to report them to the list.

<p>
In JMRI 2.1.1, when you went to load a panel file, only files with a ".xml" filename suffix were shown by default. To see all files, you could select "All Files" in the window.  This caused some confusion because many people hadn't added the ".xml" suffix to their panel file names.  We still think having a suffix like that is valuable, but to reduce confusion in JMRI 2.1.2 when you save a panel file an ".xml" suffix is added automatically to the filename if you haven't already provided it.  This makes the filename filter work better when loading a file.  If you want to provide another suffix, or none at all, select the "All Files" option in the window before saving the file. 

<p>JMRI is moving toward requiring Java 1.4 or later.  Certain new features may not work if you are using an earlier
version of Java.  To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts. This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts. Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.
