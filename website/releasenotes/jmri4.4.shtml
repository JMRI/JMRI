      Release Notes for JMRI 4.4 release
      </h2>

    <p>Date: June 30, 2016</p>
    <p>From: Matthew Harris</p>
    <p>Subject: Production version 4.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>-->

We are very pleased to announce that the 4.3 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production version 4.4" available for download today.

<ul>
    <li>None at release time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>Warnings:</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.2.1.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.2.1 release note</a>
for older warnings that may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<!-- 4.3.9 -->
<p>LocoTools, no longer supported since JMRI 2.10, has been removed from the Linux and OS X distributions.</p>

<!-- 4.3.5 -->

<p>When sharing a configuration between this version and JMRI 4.3.4 or older, the older version of JMRI will not
    reflect changes in preferences, window position, table sorting, column order, or other user interface state. This is due to
    changes in how user preferences and interface state are stored.</p>
    
<!-- 4.3.3 -->
<p>You can now set the order of your startup items: If you're opening panel files, running scripts, etc as
    the program starts up, there's a preferences pane that lets you easily set the order in which those happen.
    If you've set the order manually (e.g. by editing configuration files) in the past, please check this
    preference to make sure it's set the way you want.</p>

<p>The DispatcherPro, JMRI Demo, and SignalPro applications are no longer shipped in distributions. Use PanelPro
    in lieu of these applications.</p>

<!-- 4.3.1 -->
<p>The internals of the Layout Editor have been reworked a bit.  Please keep an
    eye out for any changed behaviors.</p>

<h3>Changes since <a href="jmri4.2.1.shtml">production release 4.2.1</a>:</h3>

    <h4>Hardware Support</h4>

        <p>Help for setting up JMRI with your OS and Java version as well as setting general preferences is available as <a href="/help/en/html/setup/index.shtml"
        target="_blank">Setup Help</a>, including a short FAQ section, so application help pages can focus on the functions in each part.</p>

        <p>Support for ARM processors running in 64-bit mode (aarch64) has been added</p>
        
        <h5>DCC++</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>This release includes fixes for release 4.2 and earlier</li>
                <li>DCC++ crash when starting with the Base Station not attached has been fixed.</li>
           </ul>

        <h5>LocoNet</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>A problem that prevented use with the Digitrax PR2 has been fixed.</li>
                <li>Fixed filtering in the LocoNet monitor</li>
                <li>Steve Rawlinson fixed a <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/159">problem with multiple throttles</a>.</li>
                <li>The Digitrax DB150 Empire Builder command station uses a single output for powering
                    both the main track and the programming track. JMRI is supposed to turn track power back
                    on after doing a programming track (Service Mode) CV write, but it was also 
                    erroneously turning track power on after going an Ops Mode CV write.  This is now
                    fixed: Power on (GPON message sent) only happens after a service mode CV write.  Note
                    that JMRI does not turn track power on after a CV write that ends it in an error;
                    this is the same behavior as before.</li>
                <li>Steve Todd and Steve G. fixed an error in the Loconet Monitor that would cause exceptions to
                    appear if Sensor/Turnout/Reporter usernames were empty</li>
                <li>Fix error preventing emergency stop in 14/28 speed step modes (Steve Rawlinson / <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1185">1185</a>)</li>
                <li>Fixed a problem with PM42 addresses greater than 9.</li>
           </ul>

        <h5>NCE</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a problem preventing the combination of an NCE-USB adapter with the PowerPro, SB3 or SB5 Smartbooster 
                    from doing ops-mode (on main) programming.</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>RFID</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a problem preventing MERG Concentrator serial connections from being used.</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>Roco z21/Z21</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Throttle support now uses Z21/z21 specific XPressNet messages and replies.</li>
                <li>Turnout support now uses Z21/z21 specific XPressNet messages and replies.</li>
                <li>Set Broadcast Flags for XPressNet messages.  This causes the command station to generate the expected replies.</li>
                <li>Add Configuration tool to the Z21 Menu.  This allows checking and setting the Z21's Broadcast flags, and displaying the serial number, hardware version, and software version.</li>
           </ul>

        <h5>SPROG</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Andrew Crosland fixed a problem with ops mode programming packet bursts through the SPROG command station.
                    Added a delay between ops mode packets and also handle the case where there is no free slot available for the packet, by reporting a timeout back to the programmer.</li>
               <li>Andrew Crosland modified SPROG command station support for a higher packet transmission rate. Added new connection methods for Pi-SPROG Raspberry-Pi hardware.</li>
             </ul>

        <h5>SRCP</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>JMRI's SRCP server implementation now supports throttles</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>TCS</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Paged access to TCS decoders could sometimes overrun the power-on/power-off cycle. Fixed.</li>
            </ul>

    <h4>Signals</h4>
        <h5>Signal Systems</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Greg McCartney provided a definition for the Norfolk and Western 1981 rulebook</li>
                <li>John Lang updated the NYC signal definitions</li>
                <li>(jkilsby) Background made transparent for icons for Danish Signals.</li>

                <li>Steve Todd improves the contents of and icons for the Basic signal system</li>
                <li>Egbert Broerse provided updates to the ProRail 1954 system</li>
                <li>Updated B&amp;O 2009 signal definitions to fix restricted aspect in some cases
                    (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1575">#1575</a>)</li>
            </ul>


    <h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The default Programming mode for any particular DCC system is now based
                on the order listed in the Java code.
                NCE and SPROG systems have been updated to default to Direct modes.
                Other systems can have the default priority order changed on request.
            </li>
            <li>The handling of decoder custom, replacement and empty panes has been improved. (Dave Heap)
                <ul>
                    <li>Documentation has been updated at
                        <a href="/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoderAdvanced.shtml#pane_considerations"
                        target="_blank">Advanced Decoder Definitions</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is now a
                        <a href="/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoderAdvanced.shtml#pane_best_practice"
                        target="_blank">Best Practice</a> recommendation, with examples.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Identify & Read Type fall back to Paged Mode if the selected mode fails. (Dave Heap)</li>
            <li>HTML can now be used in variable labels. It can already be used in pane text and tool tips.
                See <a href="/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoderAdvanced.shtml" target="_blank">Advanced Decoder Definitions</a>. (Dave Heap)</li>
            <li>Added the ability to specify non-key states used by some decoders to control outputs,
                such as Stopped, Moving, Forward, Reverse and Sensors.
                For details see the <a href="/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/FnMapping.shtml" target="_blank">Function Map</a> page. (Dave Heap)
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a problem that caused decoder definitions that have constants in Function Maps to fail to open in V4.3.5. (Dave Heap)</li>
            <li>Improvements to the "validation" checks for decoder definitions.  A couple
                false positives fixed; check that some numerical fields really do contain numbers.</li>
            <li>Previously, when loading an existing roster entry, DecoderPro just loaded the CV values. 
                This in turn loads the Variable values as the CVs change.
                Because of DP's qualified-variable support, some Variables are not connected to specific CV contents at load time; 
                they get the wrong values, and hilarity ensues. (First pointed out by Dick Bronson)
                Updated so that JMRI loads the Variable values from the file (they've been stored all along), then loads CV values as before.
            </li>
            <li>The identification process for Hornby decoder models now includes the value of CV 159.</li>
     </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Alain Le Marchand added three steam and one diesel decoder definitions</li>

                <li>Fixed missing pane issues with BLI Paragon 2 Diesel definition. (Dave Heap)</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>Digitrax</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Alain Le Marchand improved

        <h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Knut Schwichtenberg provided a definition for the FREDi SV programming</li>
            </ul>

    <h4>Operations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New feature to save all train manifest created by the program. See "Options" under
                tools in the "Settings" window. Useful when you need to review an old train manifest.</li>
            <li>New feature for classification / interchange tracks, you can now specify that only cars
                with final destinations are accepted by the C/I track. See "Track Destinations" in the
                operations help for more information.</li>
            <li>Improved manifests and switch lists with regards to cabooses and cars with FRED that
                are swapped during a train's route. Previously the caboose wasn't listed at the end of the
                train, but where in the route it needed to be blocked for a proper set out, now correctly
                listed at the end of the train.</li>
            <li>Export cars and locomotives now includes an "Out of Service" remark under the column
                "Miscellaneous".</li>
            <li>The "Show Schedules by Car Types and Load" window has been enhanced by allowing all car
                types and loads to be selected. Selecting both will give you a summary of all schedules that
                are available.</li>
            <li>New feature, you can now label a locomotive as a "B" or booster unit. B units are never
                assigned to a train requiring a single loco. B units should never appear as the lead loco in a
                manifest or switch list.  "B" units are configured by model name.</li>
            <li>The locomotive model name has the "hyphen" feature where the program won't print after
                a hyphen followed by a left parenthesis.</li>
            <li>More build report enhancements. Including a check to see if any cars or locos in
                staging have been assigned to a train that isn't the one being built.</li>
            <li>The "Routes" window now shows the maximum train length in each route.</li>
            <li>You can now sort and print your trains by their description.</li>
            <li>If "Auto Save" is enabled, the program will automatically save your files when you
                close the program or the Trains window. You will not longer get a prompt to save the operation
                files.</li>
            <li>Json manifest files are now saved in their own directory called "jsonManifests". These files
                are used to create the operation web manifests.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem where the program didn't use the road or model specified in the build
                options for locomotive changes in a train's route, and the option "Build loco consist from
                single locos" was selected.</li>
            <li>Fixed a minor problem with train icons animation when there was a locomotive change in
                a route, and two or more locomotives were individually assigned to the train.</li>
            <li>You can now manually add or delete rolling stock from a built train no matter where in
                the route the train is. Previously, you could only add cars to a train that hadn't departed its
                terminal. Now as long as the car or loco's location hasn't been serviced by the train, you can
                manually modify the train's manifest. Nice feature for operators that run in real time.</li>
            <li>New feature, you can now add a comment for each of the radio buttons in the Timetable
                window.</li>
            <li>You can now enter a two digit build date for your rolling stock. A two digit date will
                convert to something built in the 1900s.</li>
            <li>You can now force a track length to be shorter than the track space consumed by your
                rolling stock. This allows you to make length adjustments without having to remove the cars or
                locos sitting on the track.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem where operations would lockup during a train build if "Auto HPT" was
                selected for loco assignment, and no cars were assigned to the train during the build, and the
                assigned loco weight was set to zero.</li>
            <li>New feature for operations, a tool called "Automation" found under the "Trains" tools
                menu. This tool can help you automate the building of trains, and the printing of manifests and
                switch lists. See the <a
                href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/operations/Operations.shtml#Automation">Help
                for Automation</a> for more information.
            </li>
            <li>New feature for car and loco logging. Now the program creates a separate log for each
                car or loco when logging is enabled. These new files are stored in a directory called
                "rollingStock", and this directory can be found in the "logger" directory under "operations".</li>
            <li>The program will now adjust a schedule's ship destination track if you copy and delete
                a track that is referenced by the schedule. This allows you to move a track (using the copy
                track tool) to a different location and not break your schedules.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug caused by using the "Set Cars" tool and the "Cars" table sorter (clicking
                on a column heading to sort cars rather then one of the "Sort by" radio buttons). Thanks to Sam
                Simons for finding and reporting this problem.</li>
            <li>New feature for the Train row color, you can now by train
                define a train reset row color. See "Train Row Color" under "Tools"
                in the "Trains" window.</li>
            <li>Hold cars are no longer listed for staging tracks in the
                CSV files.</li>
            <li>Improvements to the import and export cars feature. You can
                now import a car's load, move count, and if the car is a caboose,
                passenger, has FRED, or utility car. You can now export only the
                cars shown in the "Cars" window. Note that you can access the
                "Cars" window from a location or track and only cars at that
                location or track are shown. Useful when exchanging cars between
                layouts.</li>
            <li>Improvements to the "Switch Lists by Location" window. Now
                changes to locations with "similar names" appear correctly in the
                table.</li>
            <li>The "Trains" window now scrolls automatically when building
                trains.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where a train manifest didn't show all of the
                work at a location with several "similar names" and the sort by
                track option was selected.</li>
            <li>The program now disallows special control characters when
                entering location names, road and road numbers. These names are
                used to create file names and file names can't have embedded
                control characters.</li>
            <li>Manifests and switch list now show locomotive set outs at the end of the work for
                switchers.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem where locomotives wouldn't reset properly when running automations.</li>
            <li>Made some build report improvements with regards to train turns.</li>
            <li>Improved how the program when building a train, finds locations for cars out of
                staging. Should help reduce the number of build failures.</li>
            <li>There's now a "HIAF" (Halt If Action Fails) checkbox for each action in the automation
                table.</li>
            <li>A "Run" button has been added to the Timetable window. The button appears when CSV
                manifests are enabled.</li>
            <li>New automation action "Is train en-route?". See help for details.</li>
            <li>Saved train Manifests are now stored in separate directories based on train names.</li>
            <li>The location window now shows if there are track restrictions when only certain trains
                or routes can access a track.</li>
            <li>The program will attempt to place buffer cars between the locomotive and hazardous
                cars. If a hazardous car and a non-hazardous car are going to the same track, the program will
                place the non-hazardous car in front of the hazardous car.</li>
            <li>All table row heights are now adjusted based on font size selected.</li>
            <li>The "Move" button for a train is now labeled "Terminate" when the train has arrived at
                the last location in the train's route.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where a random schedule was being ignored.</li>
   </ul>

    <h4>Preferences</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Preference (in Display-&gt;GUI) to let you set how long a tooltip will be shown. (Dave Heap)</li>
            <li>Individual Startup Preferences panels have been replaced with a single tabular
                panel that allows the explicit setting of startup execution order.
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/687">PR 687</a>)</li>
            <li>It is possible to specify one or more routes to be set when JMRI starts.
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/730">PR 730</a>)</li>
            <li>Additional preferences labels are available for translation. 
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/781">PR 781</a>)</li>  
            <li>You can now set the order of your startup items: If you're opening panel files, running scripts, etc as
                the program starts up, there's a preferences pane that lets you easily set the order in which those happen.
                If you've set the order manually (e.g. by editing configuration files) in the past, please check this
                preference to make sure it's set the way you want.</li>
            <li>Easy access to control the automatic launch of the WiThrottle server has been incorporated
                in the WiThrottle preferences page.</li>
            <li>It is possible for a single profile stored on a shared location to maintain individual per-computer
                settings for each connection. This feature is experimental and may not work for all connection types. Please
                report issues with this at <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/new">our GitHub issue list</a>. (Randall Wood)</li>
            <li>Added ability to create a button to launch a specific script to the startup preferences (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1165">PR 1165</a>).</li>
            <li>Displaying open windows or frames in the web server can be disabled or redirected to display panels.
                When disabled or redirected, the web server home page will list open panels under the <em>Open Windows</em>
                heading.</li>
            <li>Randall Wood fixed a problem when attempting to read profiles created after version 4.3.2 (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1523">#1523</a>)</li>
        </ul>


    <h4>Logix</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The file chooser you used to pick the script file that is run by Conditional Action 
                now starts at the script default directory.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem reloading some Logix that reference the same input (Sensor, Turnout) multiple times in a single Conditional</li>
            <li>Steve Rawlinson added keyboard shortcuts to the Layout Editor</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem where some complex Layout Editor panels don't load fully, resulting in the signals not updating properly.</li>
            <li>Improvements to the "validation" checks for panel files.  A couple
                false positives fixed; check that some numerical fields really do contain numbers.</li>
        </ul>


    <h4>Panel Editors</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Pete Cressman continues to improve the code to rotate icons to different orientations.
                The most recent change was an update to icons what have their content set and are then rotated.
                There are lots of special cases, and we're not sure we've found them all yet.
                If you have any issues around rotating various kinds of icons, please don't
                hesitate to get in touch.
            </li>
            <li>Layout Editor panel files are validated against XML Schema.  These schema
                were improved to catch several kinds of internal inconsistencies.</li>
            <li>Steve Rawlinson, fixed a bug that caused errors when saving from 
                Layout Editor if a Memory was deleted that had been linked to a Layout Block.</li>
            <li>Improvements to the "validation" checks for panel files:  A false positive fixed.</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>WiThrottle</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The default port is now 12090 instead of a random port in the Dynamic
                and/or Private Ports range. Automatic selection of a random port has
                been removed. (Randall Wood)
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Scripting</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Several improvements to the scripting windows</li>
            <li>ECMAScript is now consistently referred to as that, instead of sometimes being called JavaScript</li>
            <li>Scripting with AbstractAutomaton can now wait <u>either</u> for 
                something (Sensor, Turnout, Signal...) to change <u>or</u> for 
                a maximum time to go by. 
                (<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/scripting/FAQ.shtml#several">more info</a>)
                </li>
            <li>Fixed a rare, but really annoying, problem when multiple script threads
                wait for the same sensor.</li>
            <li>Steve Rawlinson added an <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/AutoLayoutPowerOff.py">AutoLayoutPowerOff.py example script</a> 
                which automatically powers off a layout
                when no activity has been detected for a period of time.</li>
            <li>Steve Todd added a <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/SetAllUnknownSensorsToInactive.py ">SetAllUnknownSensorsToInactive.py  example script</a> 
                which does what its name says:  Any JMRI Sensor that's showing "UNKNOWN" state will be set to "INACTIVE" state.
                This is particularly useful when using a simulated connection, as it makes it look like there's a layout connected.</li>
            <li>The 'RosterCsvExport' script was updated with examples of extracting information from
                specific bits of CV values, such as the DC-enabled bit of CV 29. (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1197">#1197</a>)</li>
            <li>ON and OFF are now defined by default for Jython scripts</li>
            <li>Oscar Moutinho provided a set of scripts to use Internet of Things (IoT) devices
                within JMRI (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1463">1463</a>)</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Warrants</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Karl Lisby contributed new 
                <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/761">Signal Controlled Warrant</a>
                support, which is better matched to layouts with short blocks between signals. </li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Dispatcher</h4>
        <p>Steve Todd enhanced Dispatcher's AutoActiveTrain feature with the following changes <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1364">(PR #1364)</a></li>:
        <ul>
            <li>for target speed, use minimum of block speed and signal speed - for signalmasts</li>
            <li>added user options to specify ramping interval and duration</li>
            <li>manual slider sets speed directly, bypassing ramping</li>
            <li>turned off AlwaysSet Turnouts, added "Trust Known State" option</li>
            <li>added a fixed delay between turnout commands</li>
            <li>prevent runaway by halting if train has no occupied sections - partial - only works with another moving train</li>
            <li>enhanced debugging and squashed a few bugs</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

    <h4>Layout Editor</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Steve Rawlinson improved the Layout Editors handing of layout blocks:
                Selecting the blank entry at the top of the drop down list when editing 
                a layout block does not remove the existing sensor if there is one set. 
                Next time you edit it the old sensor is back. 
                Modified the behaviour so that selecting the blank entry removes the sensor, 
                allowing the sensor to be assigned to a different block.
                A sensor attached to a layout block which is not in use can now be assigned
                to a different layout block.
                </li>
            <li>Steve Rawlinson made a change to allow the user to set the grid size in Layout Editor
        </ul>

    <h4>Roster</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Roster" frame, which is also the main DecoderPro window, now 
                disables (grays out) the "Identify" button if there's no service mode (programming track)
                available.  Identify reads the programming track to pick the current locomotive decoder out of
                the Roster, so it can't function when there's no connection to the programming track available.
                You can still select the locomotive manually, e.g. for local editing of the information or for 
                ops mode (on main) programming.</li>
        </ul>


    <h4>Routes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Routes in transition (started, not yet done) now show INCONSISTENT on their status sensor, and
                ACTIVE only when complete</li>
            <li>Traditionally, both CV and variable values were stored in roster entries, but only the
                specific CV values were loaded when the roster entry was opened later.  This worked when 
                all of the information was in the CVs (the variables were redundant), but now we have some
                complex decoders that use "qualifiers" to separate variables from CVs.  To handle this case, 
                we now reload the variable values from the file, then the CV values.</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Web Access</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The "frame server" can be optionally disabled.
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1334">1334</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1438">1438</a>)</li>
            <li>A placeholder has been created for embedding extra JavaScript in JMRI web pages.
                See <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/web/js/user.js">user.js</a> for details.
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1458">1458</a>)</li> 
            <li>Excessive logging when a client fails have been silenced.
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1469">1469</a>)</li>
            <li>Address vulnerability CVE-2016-4800 in Jetty. (a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1471">1471</a>)</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
        <ul>

            <li>Sonny Hansen improved the Danish translation with help from Matt Harris.</li>
            <li>A script to disable or enable IPv4 and IPv6 support in zero configuration networking, named <code>zeroconf-preferences.js</code>, can be run from the <code>jython</code> directory in the JMRI distribution. This may help some users having issues with the iPhone WiThrottle app. (Randall Wood)</li>
            <li>Fixed problem preventing "Validate XML File" from working as a Start Up Action or Button (Dave Heap).</li>
            <li>Added a default explanation to empty programmer tabs and enabled viewing of same if "Show empty tabs" is enabled. (Dave Heap)</li>

            <li>Updated the Joal library to now correctly load WAV files that contain metadata at the end of the file</li>
            <li>Herve Blorec improved the French translations</li>
            <li>The stop aspect for Danish signals was improved</li>
            <li>The "Monitor" panes in several systems weren't obeying the "always on top" check box, fixed.</li>
            <li>The PanelPro splash screen displays a localized F8 hint (Egbert Broerse).</li>
            <li>Herv&eacute; Blorec improved the French translations</li>
            <li>The French Index and Table of Contents pages properly display accentuated characters (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/738">PR 738</a>).
            <li>Egbert Broerse improved the German translation of menu items, including special character spelling</li>
            <li>Sonny Hansen improved the Danish translation</li>
            <li>John Socha-Leialoha improved the WiThrottle protocol documentation</li>
            <li>Egbert Broerse added help on using IntelliJ as an IDE for JMRI, including instructions to set the correct character formats (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/675">PR 675</a>).
            <li>The DispatcherPro, JMRI Demo, and SignalPro applications are not shipped in distributions. The code
                for these applications has not been removed from JMRI, only the launchers are no longer created. If the
                use of PanelPro in lieu of these applications is not possible, please request assistance creating your
                own launchers for these applications in the JMRI Users group. (Randall Wood)</li>
            <li>Steve Todd fixed issue with WiThrottle ip address not showing correctly on Linux systems.  Change included 
                updating JmDNS from 3.4.1 to 3.4.2.</li>
            <li>Sonny Hansen further improved the Danish translation</li>
            <li>Egbert Broerse expanded the <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/glossary/index.shtml">JMRI Glossary</a>, made it sortable and added columns with keywords from some of our Help translations. Suggestions for additional definitions are welcome.</li>
            <li>Egbert Broerse further improved the German translation and fixed some issues with the French translation</li>
            <li>Egbert Broerse further improved the WiThrottle documentation and translations</li>
            <li>Kai Vehmersalo wrote an illustrated Ubuntu install instruction</li>
            <li>Deprecated Findbugs annotations used in source code maintenance were updated to use replacement versions</li>
            <li>All power buttons now include text labels indicating current power state.</li>
            <li>Much work on internal cleanup of the code. Some small decoding and error handling improvements.</li>
            <li>The NamedBean class better adheres to the JavaBeans specification. Critically, these changes mean
                that only Strings can be used to name a property, and that the getPropertyChangeListeners(String) method
                has been renamed. (If you don't know what this means, don't worry about it; it's an internal structure thing.)</li>
            <li>The Table sorting and filtering mechanism has been changed to use mechanisms introduced for that purpose
                in Java 1.6 or newer. When sharing a configuration between this version and JMRI 4.3.4 or older, the older version
                of JMRI may start with a warning and forget table sort order.</li>
            <li>When sharing a configuration between this version and JMRI 4.3.4 or older, the older version of JMRI
                will not reflect changes in window position, table sorting, column order, or other user interface state.
                This is due to changes in how user interface state is stored.</li>
            <li>Application exit time has been reduced and applications exit more cleanly. (Randall Wood)</li>
            <li>Sonny Hansen did a lot more work on the Danish translation</li>
            <li>Alain Le Marchand updated the French translation</li>
            <li>The handling of locomotive identification was improved in DecoderPro; 
                the selection should no longer be lost if you press "ident" after rearranging the columns.</li>
            <li>The DecoderPro File menu now has a selection to verify XML files.</li>
            <li>The web server now handles HTTP redirects slightly differently. See the
                <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/web/">Web server help</a> for more details.</li>
            <li>Walt Thompson highlighted a problem in the LightTable documentation
                <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1301">(PR #1301)</a></li>
            <li>Egbert Broerse added more internationalization to the Add Routes and Add Signal Group panels
                (translators may check new keys) and reduced duplicate resource bundle keys for common elements
                to ease new translation (use Bundle.getMessage() in code)</li>
            <li>Sonnys Hansen updated the Danish translation</li>
            <li>Steve Todd updated Dispatcher's AutoActiveTrain feature.</li>
            <li>Much infrastructure work, improvements to the Javadoc, etc.</li>
            <li>Javadoc can now include UML</li>
            <li>There's just the beginnings of a <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JUnit.shtml#testScriptCode">test setup</a> for the Jython sample scripts</li>
            <li>Randall Wood fixed issues when reordering startup items (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1494">#1494</a>)</li>
            <li>Randall Wood cleaned up some excessive console logging during startup (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1508">#1508</a>)</li>
            <li>LocoTools has been removed from Linux and OS X distributions of JMRI (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1546">#1546</a>)</li>
