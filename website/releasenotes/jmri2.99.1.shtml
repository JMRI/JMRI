<h3>Changes since production release 2.14</h3>

<p> Oscar Moutinho made the following updates to the inControl web throttle app:
   <ul>
      <li>Added Turnouts and Routes.</li>
	  <li>Power Off does not block throttle.</li>
	  <li>Some icons changed (used from /resources/icons/throttles/).</li>
   </ul>

<p> Matthew Harris made the following updates:
    <ul>
        <li>Updated the NetBeans project file to use JDK 1.6</li>
        <li>Updated the Windows installer to use JRE 1.6 and to
            no longer install on Windows 98 and ME</li>
    </ul>

<p>Walt Thompson fixed a problem causing panel files with tooltips to fail validation.

<p>Dan Boudreau made the following enhancements and fixes to operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>You no longer need a schedule to assign an alternate track to a spur.  See "Alternate Track" under Edit Spur-&gt; Tools.</li>
<li>Added to print locations the ability to analyze how your tracks are consumed by various car types.</li>
<li>New switch list print option, you can now have a different car format for your switch list.  See Print Options.</li>
<li>The build reports can be read using a text editor. This feature was enabled by using Java 1.6.  See Print Options.</li>
<li>Enhanced the manifest printout for passenger trains.  Now when you have a route comment and there isn't any work, only the
location's name and route comment is printed.</li>
<li>"Block cars by pick up location" is now disabled if you use one of the generate custom load features from staging.</li>
<li>Fixed a minor problem where the track defaults weren't shown correctly when using the "Add Track" button when editing an existing track.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem when changing a car's road name or road number, sometimes the program would report that the
car would not fit on the car's current track.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem when using the conductor window and canceling a local move.</li>
<li>
</ul>

<p>Paul Bender added a new Generic Consist Manager which will be installed on systems such as the SPROG that implement a command station interface (the ability to send an arbitrary NMRA DCC packet).  This version of the Consist Manager uses an NMRA Consist Control packet to create the consist instead of the Operations Mode Programming request used in the previous Generic Consist Manager.  This will allow writing the consist address on decoders that support Operations Mode Programming, but do not allow operations mode programming of CV19 (Certain Lenz decoders fall into this category).

<p>Kevin Dickerson made the following updates:
<ul>
<li>Fixed an inconsistency issue relating to the saving of preferences in DP3 depending upon the method that it was closed</li>
<li>Update the EasyDCC interface so that it would be picked up correctly on the DP3 status screen</li>
<li>Updated the Layout Block Routing Protocol, so that when block traffic flow is updated, this is reflected in the routing table</li>
<li>Added the ability to delete Signal Mast logic from the Signaling Pairs window</li>

<p>Georgio Terdida fixed a bug that may occur when loading an XnTcp adapter.</p>

<p>Paul Bender fixed the port number display for network connection configurations.</p>

</ul>

<p>Help pages with external links (e.g. full "http:" links) and of types that the JavaHelp browser
can't display are now sent to the user's default web browser for display.
