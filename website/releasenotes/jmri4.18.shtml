      Release Notes for JMRI 4.18 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: December 23, 2019</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Production Release 4.18 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 4.17 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 4.18" available for download today.</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.11.9 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running OK before
        updating to this test release.  Once you have JMRI 4.12 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been a number of 
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    you <u>must</u> 
    update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to this release.


<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The program might fail to start if there's a consist.xml
        file in the preferences directory.  The workaround is to remove
        that file.  This is fixed in the 
        <a href="jmri4.19.2.shtml">JMRI 4.19.2 test release</a>.</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.17.2.shtml">JMRI 4.17.2</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this production release:</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        JMRI's scripting support now defaults to the UTF-8 character encoding for all
        script files on all platforms. This may require that some scripts be re-saved
        using UTF-8.</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        <strong>Windows Only</strong> The JMRI installer removes the existing
        <em>lib</em> folder from a JMRI installation when upgrading JMRI. The
        existing lib folder contents are retained in the backup folder.
        <strong>This means that any files you have added to the <em>lib</em>
            folder will be removed.</strong></li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        <strong>macOS Only</strong> This version includes changes to how
        the final .dmg file is built, signed and notarized.  This was done to increase
        compatibility with macOS 10.15 Catalina.
        Please drag the JMRI icon to the Applications folder to install this release.
        For more information on 
        <a href="https://jmri.org/install/MacOSX.shtml#catalina">Catalina compatibility</a>,
        see the 
        <a href="https://jmri.org/install/MacOSX.shtml#catalina">JMRI web site</a>.

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.4.shtml">JMRI 4.17.4</a></span>
        Panel file NamedBean items such as Turnouts, Sensors, etc are now written to panel
        files in order by their Manager system prefix and system name.
        Previously, they had (roughly) been written in the order they'd be 
        read from the earlier file(s). This will result in a big change to the order
        the first time a file is re-written, but after that it should be much more stable.</li>
        
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.16.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.16 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.17 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<ul>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.6.shtml">JMRI 4.15.6</a></span>
        Remembering the location and size of layout panels created and maintained
        using Layout Editor, Panel Editor, Control Panel Editor, and Switchboard
        Editor is no longer dependent on saving the panel.  The location and size
        values are retained using the same processes used by other JMRI windows.  This
        makes the window management behavior consistent.  To continue using the
        old behavior, go to <strong>Preferences >> Display</strong> and enable
        <strong>Use old location and size logic for editor panels</strong>.

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.6.shtml">JMRI 4.15.6</a></span>
        Starting in <a href="jmri4.15.6.shtml">JMRI 4.15.6</a>, Memories
        must have valid system names of the form "IM" folllowed by something.
        "IM123" and "IMEAST" are both valid. 
        The system name "IM", all by itself, has never been valid, but JMRI 
        will now be enforcing that:
        <ul>
            <li>You won't be able to create a memory with that name via
                the Memory table or scripts
            <li>If you have that name in a panel file, an error will be 
                logged and the panel file won't load. You'll have to 
                remove it from he file or rename it in the file
                before loading it.
        </ul>
        JMRI needs to start enforcing this in preparation for some
        future code that will appear later this year.
</li>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.5.shtml">JMRI 4.15.5</a></span>
        The handling of Turnout system names has been updated
        to be (more, hopefully completely) consistent with the
        <a href="/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">planned approach</a>.
        Specifically, case now (generally) matters in system names:
        <ul>
            <li>You can now have an internal turnout named "ITsome lower case name".
            <li>But note you can no longer refer to "ITSOME LOWER CASE NAME" or
                "ITSome LoWeR cAse Name" and get the same one.
        </ul>
        This should not require any migration for stored configurations or 
        panel files, as they have been automatically been being kept consistent 
        since JMRI 4.8.  But you might have case errors in i.e. scripts which
        will fixing inconsistent references in your scripts.
        Of course, bugs are always possible. If you find a place where 
        names seem to be handled inconsistently, please let us know!

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.4.shtml">JMRI 4.15.4</a></span>
        The calculation of Turnout Addresses for the
        <a href="/help/en/html/hardware/dccpp/Turnouts.shtml" target="_blank">
        Direct DCC Accessory Command ("a" command)</a> mode
        has been fixed (commands are now sent to the correct accessory address rather
        than 4 less than the nominated hardware address). For pre-existing panels,
        changes will need to be made to either the actual decoder address or the panel.
        If help is required, ask on the
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/" target="_blank">
        jmriusers</a> group.

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.3.shtml">JMRI 4.15.3</a></span>
        The prefix that identifies a layout connection should be a single letter, like "N" or "L",
        or a letter and some digits, like "K2" or "D3". Some older systems used to have
        longer "legacy system prefixes" like "DX", "DCCPP", "DP", "MR", "MC", "PI", and "TM".
        Those <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">legacy system prefixes</a>
        will now cause JMRI to issues a warning at startup. In this release, JMRI will
        still work with those prefixes, but they will need to be migrated to the proper form soon;
        JMRI 4.19.1 and later will <u>require</u> that this have been fixed.
        Therefore, this warning can't be suppressed
        without migrating the prefix in the connection configuration (and any associated
        panel files and scripts).
        If you're getting this warning and therefore need to do that migration,
        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">migration page</a>.</li>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

                    4.17.5</a></span> The Traffic Monitor window has additional
                    options to make reading the log easier. A checkbox allows
                    showing the Node Name of the sender of a message. Another
                    checkbox allows showing for Event messages the name(s) that
                    JMRI can deduce about the specific Event ID. These are the
                    same names as shown in the CDI window, usually Sensor and
                    Turnout User Names, as well as references to currently open
                    CDI editor windows that contain the given Event ID.
                  </li>
            </ul>


    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>When a train is scheduled to re-start every X minutes this behaviour now continues over midnight times.<br>
	        Eg. a train which restarts every 10 minutes and completes the route at 23:55 will resume at 00:05.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Layout Editor combo boxes have been changed to support the migration
                from JmriBeanComboBox to NamedBeanComboBox.  The affects the Toolbar,
                the Edit context menu, Set Signal Heads, Set Signal Masts, and Set Sensors.
                <ul>
                    <li>Typing a name into the combo box field no longer works.  The
                    items have to be selected from the combo box drop down.</li>
                    <li>Typing a letter or two will position the selection.</li>
                    <li>Positioning is based on both the user name and the system name.
                    For example, typing <strong>i</strong> will select items with user names starting
                    with the letter i/I as well as internal items using the system name which starts with i/I.</li>
                    <li>With this release, it is not possible to create new Block entries
                    using the Edit context item.</li>
                    <li>If a block is selected that does not have a user name, a
                    dialog will prompt for a user name.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Improved functioning of Supporting Turnouts using feedback.</li>
 	        <li>Blocks can be automatically created when assigned to track components in the edit dialogs.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
        <a id="Preferences" name="Preferences"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Updated saved window positions to cope with multiple screen setups (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/7616">PR #7616</a>)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved behaviour of multiple <a 
              href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightAddEdit.shtml#lightcontrolfastclock"
              >Fast Clock following Light Controllers</a> on a single Light.</li>
            <li>JMRI no longer modifies "system names" as provided by the user.
                There may be cases where a script or panel file is creating an
                object with a system name that is slightly different than a system
                name used elsewhere, and JMRI used to change these to be the same.
                Users may have to modify scripts and panel files to ensure system
                names match in all places.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a new SetUnknownTurnoutsClosed script that does what it says on the tin</li>
            <li>Added script tests for SetUnknownTurnoutsClosed and SetAllTurnoutsClosed
            <li>jmri_bindings.py is no longer needed by JMRI to inject default bindings into
              Jython/Python scripts.</li>
            <li>Jython has been upgraded to version 2.7.1.</li>
            <li>JMRI's scripting support now defaults to the UTF-8 character encoding for all
              script files on all platforms. This may require that some scripts be re-saved
              using UTF-8.</li>
            <li>The jython/SetSignalFlashRate.py sample script shows how to 
                change the flashing on/off time for your signals.  Just invoke
                it before defining the signals, i.e. before loading your
                configuration and panel files.

   <h3>Tracker</h3>
        <a id="Tr" name="Tr"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>A Tracker help page is added.</li>
            <li>Tracking can be done with intermediate cars unequippted to draw current.</li>
            <li>Tracker can recover occupation lost due to poor electrical contact.</li>
            <li>Tracking can be followed through dark OBlocks.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>CircuitBuilder now allows a portal to have a second icon to connect blocks
            that are not adjacent on the layout diagram.</li>
            <li>Configuring signals for use with warrants has been added to CircuitBuilder.</li>
            <li>Several checks for errors and omissions have been added to CircuitBuilder.
            See the updated help page for details on this and the new features.</li>
            <li>Changes made in either the OBlock Tables tool or the CircuitBuilder tool
            are reflected in the other tool - i.e. each updates the other.</li>
            <li>When the names of OBlocks, Portals or Paths are made, Warrants are
            updated to run as they did with the previous names.</li>
            <li>If an OBlock, Portal or Path is deleted, a Warrant using one of these 
            elements will be broken. When this occurs, a dialog is displayed listing
            the disabled Warrants. The user may decide to remove these warrants and 
            continue or to cancel the deletions.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Access</h3>
        <a id="WA" name="WA"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Certain Tables menu items now support changing state by clicking on state in list</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>If using a non-default look and feel; it may need to be reset. Note that the look and feel stored by JMRI 4.17.1 and
                later will be ignored by JMRI 4.16 and earlier.</li>
            <li>We "deprecate" certain methods and members in the Java code when they're
                no longer recommended for use.  After some time, we then remove them.
                This version of JMRI removes all deprecated methods and members up
                through JMRI 4.10, which was released in December 2017.
                If you still have code or scripts that reference these, please
                look at
                <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/tree/v4.16">the code in JMRI 4.16</a>
                for suggestions on what to substitute.</li>
            <li>Removed <code>Manager.getSystemNameAddedOrderList()</code>, deprecated in JMRI 4.11.1</li>
            <li>Panel file NamedBean items such as Turnouts, Sensors, etc are now written to panel
                files in order by their Manager system prefix and system name.
                Previously, they had (roughly) been written in the order they'd be 
                read from the earlier file(s). This will result in a big change to the order
                the first time a file is re-written, but after that it should be much more stable.
            <li><strong>Windows Only</strong> The JMRI installer removes the existing
                <em>lib</em> folder from a JMRI installation when upgrading JMRI. The
                existing lib folder contents are retained in the backup folder.
                <strong>This means that any files you have added to the <em>lib</em>
                    folder will be removed.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>macOS Only</strong> This version includes changes to how
                the distributed files are signed.  This includes signing individual
                libraries, signing libraries inside jar files, signing the three
                app bundles, and signing the .dmg file itself, followed by 
                notarizing the .dmg file.
                This was done to increase
                compatibility with macOS 10.15 Catalina.
            <li>Added basic support for developer architecture checks via
                <a href="https://www.archunit.org">ArchUnit</a>,
                see the 
                <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/IntroStructure.shtml">Introduction to JMRI Library Structure</a>
