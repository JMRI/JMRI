<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the

<p><strong>This is the last JMRI production or test version that will work with Java 1.6.</strong><br>  
To use any later JMRI test or production releases, you'll have to 
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or later.
This version has been tested on Java 1.8, so you can do the Java update now if you want to.

<h3>Warnings:</h3>

<!-- keep this warning in place through the 3.11/3.12 development cycle -->
<p>The XmlIO web service has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed after JMRI 3.12 (July 2015).
All users and developers who are relying on direct access to the XmlIO API are
recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle users are recommended to
begin using webThrottle instead, or to plan on investing in devices that can support
webThrottle, <a href="http://www.withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a> for iOS, or
<a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org">Engine Driver</a> for Android.</p>

<!-- keep this warning in place through the 3.11/3.12 development cycle -->
<p>Several methods in the InstanceManager class have been deprecated and will be removed
after JMRI 3.12 (July 2015). This doesn't affect JMRI users, but if you have your own 
code that uses JMRI, please 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/jmri/java/src/jmri/InstanceManager.java">take a look at the code</a>
and make any necessary changes.


   <h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
   <p>NCE macro editor when used on the PowerHouse (CS02) serial port was broken (3.7.9) while
    adding code to support the USB based NCE systems (PowerCab, SB5, Twin). This is fixed in 3.11.5.</p>

   <p>OperationsPro bug, caboose or car with FRED that departs and returns to the same staging
    track can lose the departure track assignment after the train is built. Fixed in 3.11.4.</p>
