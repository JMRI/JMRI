<h3>Warnings</h3>

JMRI 2.12 was the last release which is completely supported by Java 1.5.
In this release, there are minor interface features, such as 
drag-and-drop of some items, that require your computer to have Java 1.6 installed.
Computers with only Java 1.5 will still be able to use JMRI, including PanelPro and DecoderPro,
in this release except for those features.
Releases in the next cycle (2.99.* and 3.*)
will require Java 1.6.


<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
There are currently some connectivity issues for Users running Windows v7 64-bit and a Digitrax PR3 interface.
If you are experiencing issues, then please raise a question on the JMRI Users group for assistance.
