      Release Notes for JMRI 4.19.5 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: April 23, 2020</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.19.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please 
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release in early summer 2020.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.11.9 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running without errors 
        during startup or on the JMRI log.  
        Once you have JMRI 4.12 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
        you <u>must</u> 
        update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
        carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
        before updating to this release.
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.17.7 or earlier, including if the previous paragraphs
        convinced you to update to JMRI 4.12, 
        we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.18.shtml">JMRI 4.18</a> and make sure that's running without errors 
        during startup or on the JMRI log.
        Once you have JMRI 4.18 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been
        changes panel file format and configuration options since earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.18.shtml">JMRI 4.18</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.19.6.shtml">JMRI 4.19.6</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
   
    <li>
        Layout Editor files that are stored with this version will not 
        generally be readable by earlier versions.  This version
        continues to be able to read files written by releases
        back to 4.12 and in many cases even older.
    </li>

</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.18.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.18 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.19 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<ul>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.4.shtml">JMRI 4.19.4</a></span>
    <code>Manager.getSystemNameArray()</code> has been removed after being 
    deprecated for two years. Please migrate to using
    <code>Manager.getNamedBeanSet()</code> instead.  If you really
    must have an array, use <code>Manager.getNamedBeanSet().toSet()</code>
</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.3.shtml">JMRI 4.19.3</a></span>
    <code>Manager.getSystemNameArray()</code> has been removed after being 
    deprecated for two years. Please migrate to using
    <code>Manager.getNamedBeanSet()</code> instead.  If you really
    must have an array, use <code>Manager.getNamedBeanSet().toArray()</code>;
    see <a href="https://www.techiedelight.com/convert-set-to-array-java/">this tutorial</a> for examples.
</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.3.shtml">JMRI 4.19.3</a></span>
    The JavaCSV API has been replaced with the Apache Commons CSV API.
    This may impact some scripts. See
    <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/jython/TurnoutStatePersistence.py">TurnoutStatePersistence.py</a>
    for an example of how to use the new CSV parsing API. If unable to
    use the new API, the JAR for the old API can be
    <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/sourceforge/javacsv/javacsv/2.0/javacsv-2.0.jar">downloaded</a>
    and added to jmri.conf using the
    <em><a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/StartUpScripts.shtml">--cp:a=path/to/javacsv.jar</a></em>
    parameter.</li>
</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.1.shtml">JMRI 4.19.1</a></span>
        JMRI now enforces the standard form of system names,
        where the system is denoted by a single letter or a letter plus digits.
        Some users of JMRI 4.18 or earlier might have incompatible values.
        If you have one of these hardware connections:
        <ul>
            <li>Anyma DX512 using “DX”
            <li>DCC++ using “DCCPP"
            <li>DCC4PC using “DP"
            <li>JSON client using “json”
            <li>MRC using “MR"
            <li>Marklin CS2 using “MC"
            <li>Raspberry PI using “PI"
            <li>TAMS using “TM”
        </ul>
        you may have to migrate. Please update to JMRI 4.18 prior 
        to installing JMRI 4.19.1 (or later) and check the JMRI Console to
        see if there are any instructions there. See the 
        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">migration page</a>
        for additional information.
    </li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.1.shtml">JMRI 4.19.1</a></span>
        The <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        calls in the various <code>Manager</code> classes
        are no longer needed with Java 8 and have been deprecated for eventual
        removal.  Their replacements are 
        <code>getByUserName</code> and <code>getBySystemName</code> 
        respectively. 
        If you use <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        in script or Java code you've written, please 
        switch to the new names.
    </li>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        JMRI's scripting support now defaults to the UTF-8 character encoding for all
        script files on all platforms. This may require that some scripts be re-saved
        using UTF-8.</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        <strong>Windows Only</strong> The JMRI installer removes the existing
        <em>lib</em> folder from a JMRI installation when upgrading JMRI. The
        existing lib folder contents are retained in the backup folder.
        <strong>This means that any files you have added to the <em>lib</em>
            folder will be removed.</strong></li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        <strong>macOS Only</strong> This version includes changes to how
        the final .dmg file is built, signed and notarized.  This was done to increase
        compatibility with macOS 10.15 Catalina.
        Please drag the JMRI icon to the Applications folder to install this release.
        For more information on 
        <a href="https://jmri.org/install/MacOSX.shtml#catalina">Catalina compatibility</a>,
        see the 
        <a href="https://jmri.org/install/MacOSX.shtml#catalina">JMRI web site</a>.

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.4.shtml">JMRI 4.17.4</a></span>
        Panel file NamedBean items such as Turnouts, Sensors, etc are now written to panel
        files in order by their Manager system prefix and system name.
        Previously, they had (roughly) been written in the order they'd be 
        read from the earlier file(s). This will result in a big change to the order
        the first time a file is re-written, but after that it should be much more stable.</li>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

</ul>

            </ul>

        <h4>ESU</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added LokPilot 5 family.</li>
                <li>Updated LokSound 5 <strong>Consist</strong> and <strong>Sound Levels</strong> panes to handle latest firmware updates.</li>

                <li>DSD-100LC steam & diesel add CV59</li>
            </ul>

   <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Palette</strong> and <strong>Circuit Builder</strong>
             windows make a "best effort" to open at a position minimizing 
             any area that may obscure the panel display.</li>
        <h4>Circuit Builder</h4>
            <a id="CPE-CB" name="CPE-CB"></a>
            <ul>
            <li>The system name is auto generated when the<strong>Add New Detector Circuit
             </strong> window is opened. This name may be changed before the Occupancy
             Block is created. After creating, the field is removed from the window
             since the system name can no longer be edited.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Palette</h4>
            <a id="CPE-P" name="CPE-P"></a>
            <ul>
            <li>Each tab resizes to display itself with its preferred dimensions.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Memory</strong> Tab has been modified to display generic 
             forms of their respective devices.  Dragging is best accomplished by 
             mouse down within the <strong>Drag to Panel</strong> box, but outside
             of the device icon itself.</li>
            <li>Bugs in the <strong>Signal Mast</strong> and <strong>Background</strong>
             tabs have been fixed.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Text</strong> tab items have been rearranged.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>The displayed names in the <strong>Section</strong> and <strong>Transit</strong>
             tables, along with the transit selection and block selections in the
             <strong>Activate New Train</strong> Dispatcher window, now behave like other
             JMRI tools.  Instead of the <strong>system name (user name)</strong> format,
             the names use the <strong>display name</strong> format.  The display name format
             uses the <strong>user name</strong>.  If not available, the system name is used.</li>
             <li>The list size for the dropdown combo boxes use the content size instead of
             the default 8 rows.</li>
             <li>The Section, Transit, and Dispatcher help documents have been updated.  The
             Section and Transit help have been cleaned up to reduce redundant verbiage.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Jython has been updated to version 2.7.2</li>
            <li>Long deprecated <code>instance()</code> methods to get the default
                instance of a manager have been removed. Use
                <code>InstanceManager.getDefault(NameOfManager.class)</code>
                instead.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/8286">PR 8286 revised the way 
                that JMRI code should fire and catch events.  If you have code (Java or script)
                of your own that implements event firing or tricky listening, you
                should review those changes to see if they will or should affect your code.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>
        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Eckart Meyer updated the DB HV 1969 system to have proper aspect control.</li>
            </ul>

   <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a speed step dropdown to the extended throttle;
                this makes it easier to select the speed step mode and
                makes it possible to select the less common speed step modes
                exposed by some systems.
            </li>
            <li>Consolidated the throttle layout code,
                centralized the logic for determining if throttle icons should be shown,
                and added unit tests for the control panel layout and some preferences.
            </li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Warrant List</strong> now responds to changes in window size.
            The length of the status field varies as needed and keeps the
            <strong>Stop All Trains</strong> button visible even on small screens.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>When creating a new warrant the system name is auto generated. This name may be
            changed before the warrant is saved. After saving the field can not be edited.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The VSD old graphical user interface (GUI) was removed. For users who call VSD
            from JMRI PanelPro, nothing changes. For users who call VSD from a Jython script,
            theoretically the script can fail. Please see also
            <a href="https://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/vsdecoder/VSDecoderFrame.shtml">here</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows Installer updated to support OpenJDK 8 from <a 
            href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">AdoptOpenJDK.net</a>.</li>
