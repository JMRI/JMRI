      Release Notes for JMRI 4.9.4 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: September 17, 2017</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.9.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2017.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Required Migration Step<span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a></span></h3>
JMRI was updated in JMRI 4.7.4 to use a new serial library. Depending on your exact
circumstances, you may need to do some migrations:
<ul>
<li>If you are using JMRI on Linux or macOS and are updating from an older JMRI version,
<em>you must open the JMRI preferences and make sure that the selections are 
correct for your serial device(s).</em> Be sure to save the changes.
<p>
In general, previous versions used serial device names like 
"/dev/cu.usbserial-ABC123FG". This version will generally omit the prefix, and
use serial device names like "cu.usbserial-ABC123FG".
(If given the choice if a name starting with "tty" and one starting with "cu", 
pick the "cu" one). See the before and after images to the right.
<li>
If you are using Linux and have previously used the "JMRI_SERIAL_PORTS"
option to make sure your serial device is visible to JMRI, you'll have 
to change that to use the "purejavacomm.portnamepattern" option instead.
See the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/install/FAQLinux.shtml#usb">JMRI Linux install page</a> for more information.
<li>
If you have your own JMRI scripts to access a serial device, you'll have to update
their library references:
    <ul>
    <li>Any 
        <code>import gnu.io</code> statements will have to be replaced by 
        <code>import purejavacomm</code> statements.
    <li>More generally, any reference to 
        <code>gnu.io</code>, e.g. a reference to a class like 
        <code>gnu.io.SerialPort</code>, statements will have to be replaced by 
        a reference to the corresponding 
        <code>purejavacomm</code> class.
    </ul>
</ul>


<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.7.6.shtml">JMRI 4.7.6</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Due to changes in the capitalization of some method and property names, some scripts may fail until
    adjusted to use the new capitalization. The <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc">Javadocs</a> for any
    JMRI class will list the correct capitalization.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.8.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.8 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.9 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.9.3.shtml">JMRI 4.9.3</a></span>
    For Windows users only: <a href="jmri4.9.3.shtml">JMRI 4.9.3</a> (and all later) has a new 
    version of the "LaunchJMRI.exe" program.  It's used to set options as
    JMRI is starting up, and is a completely normal part of JMRI.  Because it's
    new and different, however, your anti-virus program may reject it. 
    You might get a message about "file removed" or "file quarantined" or similar
    and then JMRI might not start.
    The solution is to make sure that your anti-virus program doesn't interfere
    with JMRI's installation and running. There are so many of those, unfortunately,
    that we can't really provide useful instructions beyond that.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.6.shtml">JMRI 4.7.6</a></span>
    If you're having trouble getting your DCC programmer to work, try
    checking that the "Defaults" under "Preferences" are set to your
    hardware system.
    The reason: This version of JMRI (and all later) provides more options for
    "default systems": If you have multiple sets of hardware attached, which
    should be used for throttles, for programming, etc.  JMRI tries to 
    guess the right settings for these when you upgrade to this version, but 
    apparently it sometimes gets that wrong (we haven't been able to track
    that down yet). Setting them manually fixes any wrong guesses.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.5.shtml">JMRI 4.7.5</a></span>
    <a href="jmri4.7.5.shtml">JMRI 4.7.5</a> (and all later) writes a slightly streamlined
    version of panel file contents.  
    Older files should still be readable by this version of JMRI, 
    but files written by this version may not be readable by versions
    before JMRI 4.2 depending on their contents.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.5.shtml">JMRI 4.7.5</a></span>
    The LocoNetOverTCP server has changes that may break scripts that reference it. Scripts refering to
    the class jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.Server need to refer instead to
    jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.LnTcpServer.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.3</a></span> 
    This release will not start cleanly if installed over earlier versions of JMRI (the Windows installer ensures
    this is not an issue). Remove the JAR files <em>jackson-annotations-2.0.6.jar</em>, <em>jackson-core-2.0.6.jar</em>,
    and <em>jackson-databind-2.0.6.jar</em> from the <em>lib</em> directory within the previous installation directory to resolve
    this.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span>
    JMRI no longer supports the portable paths <code>resource:</code> or <code>file:</code> that
    were deprecated in JMRI 2.13. When loading a panel, an error message will be displayed
    if the panel contains a path that starts with <code>resource:</code> and the panel will
    not load until changed using an external editor. Paths starting with <code>file:</code>
    cannot be automatically flagged because JMRI allows file: URLs.
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span>
    The LocoNet Server (the LocoNetRMI service; not the LocoNetOverTcp service)
    in this version of JMRI doesn't properly interoperate with 
    <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a> through <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a>.
    It does work fine with <a href="jmri4.6.shtml">JMRI version 4.6</a> or before.
    If you encounter a problem with version compatibility, you'll see an error
    message that includes "<code>local class incompatible</code>".
    The workaround is to update both client and server JMRI machines to the same
    JMRI version. 
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span> 
    JMRI applications will not load a panel file that fails XML validation; an error will be
    shown that should explains the error, allowing it to be fixed using an editor. (The
    explanations remain a work in progress.) If you have a problem loading a
    panel file, please
    <ul>
        <li>Configure your JMRI startup to first run the 
            <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/TurnOffXmlValidation.py">jython/TurnOffXmlValidation.py</a>
            script which will suppress the error.
        <li>Write out a new version of the panel file (after saving a backup!)
        <li>Use that new version from now on.
        <li>And drop use of the jython/TurnOffXmlValidation.py script.
    </ul>

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.6.shtml">JMRI 4.5.6</a></span>  
    As part of fixing the 
    <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/2081">TMCC throttle issue</a>,
    the handling of TMCC preferences was changed.  If you have a TMCC
    connection configured, please go to the 
    "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Connection">Defaults</a>"
    pane in the Preferences window and make sure that the 
    TMCC connection is selected for the appropriate device types.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span>
    This and future releases of JMRI may not function on OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. OS X
    operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
    user's group.
    To remove Java SE 6 from OS X, follow these steps (these steps assume
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>, if not,
      adjust the following paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command <code>/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh</code> It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
          It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
        </li>
      <li><em>El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span>
    Support for directly executing AppleScript within JMRI has been removed
    due to changes in macOS and Java outside our control. If you require the
    ability to use AppleScript, you may be able to add this capability on your
    own by visiting <a href="https://jmri.github.io/applescript">JMRI
      AppleScript Support</a>, but please be aware that this may not work
    on upcoming releases of macOS or Java.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.1.shtml">JMRI 4.5.1</a></span> 
    Internal turnouts and sensors need to have complete, individual system names.
    The names "IT" and "IS" (without any suffix) are no longer permitted:
    "IT12" is fine, but just "IT" is not. Most panel files that contain these should
    automatically migrate them to new names when saved, but in some cases you might need to manually update them.

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri4.9.3.shtml">Production release 4.9.3</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aclosed&q=milestone%3A4.9.4">list of included commits</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>RFID</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Support for the Olimex MOD-RFID1356MIFARE has been added.</li>
            </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The range of automatically Recorded track speeds is much wider than was anticipated.  The feature
	    introduced in 4.9.2 using the throttle setting corresponding to the desired track speed is disabled. 
	    Warrants use the throttle setting as stated in the script.</li>
	    <li>The option to not use ramps for speed changes required by signals, blocks or rogue occupation is
	    added to the NXWarrant windows.</li>
	    <li>NXWarrants use power series for start and end ramps.  Start ramp throttle increments are incresed
	    by 8% at each time interval. End ramp throttle increments are decreased by 8% at each interval.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <kbd>--profile</kbd> command line argument to start a JMRI application with a specific profile
	    now takes the profile ID or the path to the profile directory as an argument (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/3968">#3968</a>).</li>
	    <li>Excessive work and potential StackOverflow errors opening a profile have been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/4005">#4005</a>).</li>
	    <li>The capitalization of many method and property names in JMRI has been changed to be internally
	    consistent within JMRI and to adhere to standard Java naming principles (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/4034">#4034</a>).</li>
