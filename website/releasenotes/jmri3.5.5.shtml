<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.6 production release around the end of the year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.5.4:</h3>

<p>Changes to decoder programming and definition allow 
specification of workarounds when a command station only handles a subset of CVs, and
the decoder provides a way to access the full range locally.  Useful with ESU and Zimo
decoders, but not all (close to none) of the decoder definitions have been updated to
use this. 

<p>NCE command station programmer updated to indicate when it can't access high-address CVs.


   <p>Dave Heap added automatic display of CV numbers in DecoderPro tooltips. To see the CV
    address for a decoder parameter, hover your mouse over it. By default this is off (DecoderPro
    exists to hide this information, not show it), but you can turn in on with a preference under
    Roster, then Programmer.
   
   <p>The OpenLCB lib was updated to the current version. This includes several memory-read
    protocol fixes.
   
   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>New feature, the ability to copy any track to a location. See under the Edit Location,
     Tools, "Copy Track".</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue with train manifest times when the "same" location was used back to
     back.</li>
    <li>Made some improvements to the train build reports.</li>
    <li>Made some minor improvements to the conductor and yard master windows.</li>
    <li>New manifest and switch list option, the ability to show the car's final destination
     and track.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem when a spur has a schedule and "Planned Pick Ups".</li>
    <li>Improved car movement when the train's route move count is used up or the train's length
     is maxed out when building the train.</li>
   </ul>

	<p>Ken Cameron made the following changes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed memory addressing issue in macro editor/backup/restore.
			This bug was introduced prior to 3.4 when adding support for the updated
			NCE USB for other functions. Currently Macro support via the NCE USB is a
			work in progress.
			</li>
	</ul>

<p>
David Zuhn updated the Mac OS X launcher to handle different Java configurations,
particularly when installing a clean version of Mac OS X.

<p>
Bjorn Kvisli and Pierre Billon created multiple Doehler &amp; Haass decoder definitions.

<p>
Bjorn Kvisli added decoder definitions for the Arnold N scale decoders.

<p>
Peter Ulvestad added a decoder definition for the MRC 1952,
improved the definition for the MRC 1957, added the 1922 and 1916.

<p>
Suzie Tall fixed some cross-references that were preventing the CROR-2008 
and InfraBel signals from displaying properly.

<p>
Dick Bronson provided additional UTCS track segment icons.

<p>
The timestamp on messages in the console output was changed to default to
a real timestamp like "2013-11-17 15:16:07,486" in local time.
