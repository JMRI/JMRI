<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.6 production release around the end of the year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since production release 3.4:</h3>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>New two column format for car pick ups and set outs. Go to the Manifest Print Options,
     and under Message Format, select "Two Column" if you want your manifest and switch lists to use
     two columns, one for pickups and one for set outs. The color options for pick up and set outs
     aren't available when using this format.</li>
    <li>You can now modify all of the manifest and switch lists text. See under Manifest Print
     Options, Tools, "Edit Manifest Text" and "Edit Switch List Text".</li>
    <li>Now when you modify the train manifest using the "Manifest Print Options" window, the
     train manifests are immediately changed for trains that are built but haven't departed the
     first location in their route.</li>
    <li>Improved text line wrapping for comments in the Conductor and Yardmaster windows.</li>
   </ul>

   <ul>
      <li>SignalMasts - Improved support for SignalMast unlit for DCC/LNCP &amp; Turnout based masts - KD</li>
      <li>SignalMasts - Log a warning to the console rather than throwing an error when trying to set an aspect that has not been configured - KD</li>
      <li>SignalMasts - Corrected the way in which a unlit/lit signal mast icon is displayed on a panel - KD</li>
      <li>SignalMasts - Add an option to allow a default DCC accessory aspect ID to be recorded against a given aspect in a signaling system - KD</li>
      <li>SignalMast Logic/Entry Exit - Consider the state of a crossing block on a Level Crossing - KD</li>
      <li>SignalMast Logic/Entry Exit - Handle layout editor crossovers where there are two physical turnouts that need to be set/check rather than the primary turnout.- KD</li>
      <li>Entry Exit - Update the Stack window to use a JDialog rather than a JFrame - KD</li>
      <li>Editors - Fix an issue where a rotated icon based sensor icon is changed to a text based icon fails as no text values were set. - KD</li>
      <li>Editors - Change the loading of sensor icons, so that the text details are loaded before the sensor is set, so that when the panel is loaded the sensor icon is displayed correctly when first displayed. - KD</li>
      <li>Layout Editor - Change the block edit so that it is now possible to access all of the properties of the block, and not just those items that specifically relate to a layout block. - KD</li>
      <li>Layout Editor - Added in an Edge Connector to allow blocks to be connected over multiple panels to form a single logical view.</li>
      <li>Blocks - Remove the dependency for a block to have a valid sensor to move an object about, but use the occupancy state of the neighboring blocks instead. - KD</li>
     </ul> 
     
    <p>Suzie Tall provided support for three new signal systems:
        <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/CROR-2008/index.shtml">CROR-2008</a> from Transport Canada,
        <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/InfraBel-2013/index.shtml">InfraBel-2013</a> from Belgium and
        <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/ProRail-1954/index.shtml">ProRail-1954</a> from the Netherlands.
        
    <p>Michael Mosher provided an improved definition for the TCS WOW decoder
    
    <p>Dave Heap added a CV Reset Warning for all LokSound Decoders
    
    <p>Michael Mosher added the HO Challenger to the Sountraxx Tsuanmi Steam Genesis definition
        and the U28B/U30B to the Sountraxx Tsuanmi Walthers Diesel definition
        
    <p>Martin Jahner improved the Kato FL12 decoder definition
    
    <p>Paul Bender Added base support for IEEE 802.15.4 messages.  All this does at this point is allows sending and receiving of raw IEEE 802.15.4 messages from a serial port connection.  This configuration was tested using an XBee in API mode connected to the computer via a SparkFun Electronics XBee Explorer USB device.  Other devices supporting the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol should work as well, but have not been tested.  This code should be considered experimental.  There are likely bugs.<p> 

    <p> Michael Mosher updated the TCS WOW decoder definition.
