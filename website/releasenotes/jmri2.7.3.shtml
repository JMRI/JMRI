<!--
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>
-->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.8 production release in December 2009. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>fix for the problem that caused JMRI 2.7.1 to occasionally hang
<li>improvements to Logix and Panel Editor
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<h3>Changes since test version 2.7.1</h3>

Paul Bender added initial support for connecting to a Lenz LI-USB via the Lenz server.

<p>
Nigel Cliffe added a SerialPortRFID.py script to allow MERG RFID equipment to be read into JMRI.

<p>
Pete Cressman made several improvements to the Panel Editor:
<ul>
<li>The icon editor's window title now shows which panel it's associated with.
<li>The Icon editors now reset to their default settings whenever opened.
<li>The "Add to Table" function of the Icon editors now has a button to enter the element. 
    The new entry is highlighted in the table before adding it to the panel.
<li>Sensor icons now have a text attribute to make them easier to use as buttons.
<li>Moving all the panel text to a properties file so it can now be translated.
<li>Having the image index only store user modified default icon settings.
</ul>

<p>
Pete Cressman improved Logix Conditionals by
<ul>
<li>Adding a state variable memory-to-memory compare operation.  Two memory values may be tested for: less than, less than or equal, equals, greater than or equal, greater than.  When one or both values is numeric, the test is numeric.  Otherwise the compare is lexicographic.
<li>The previous state variable "memory equals" comparing a memory value to a value, has been extended to test for: &lt;, &lt;=, =, &gt;=, &gt;.
</ul>

<p>
Dan Boudreau made some minor bug fixes in the operations feature: 
Locations window didn't always show the correct number of car and engine pickups for each location.
Small change in functionality, train reset no longer swaps car loads.

<p>
Internal Lights (IL1, etc) now support variable intensity.

<p>
The bug causing the program to hang when editing a Logix, Route or Light has been fixed.
(This fix was in JMRI 2.6.1, but not in JMRI 2.7.1)

<p>
Dan Boudreau added a new save panel feature.  
When saving a panel that already exists, the program now saves a backup copy of the panel in a directory called "backupPanels".  
The backup panel's file name is modified with the current date and time.

<p>
Added a new Panel Editor icon for Memory objects that lets you set and modify numeric values.
This is a simple initial implementation for values that range from 0 to 100, with more customization, etc, to follow
if people are interested in this.

<p>
Fix the script input window so that large scripts can be entered.  Once the initial text window is full, scroll-bars will appear.
Also, fixed a bug that could cause the "Execute" button to disappear.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added initial support for RFID tags to the operations database.
