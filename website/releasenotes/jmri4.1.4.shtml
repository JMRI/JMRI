      Release Notes for JMRI 4.1.4 release
      </h2>

    <p>Date: November 25, 2015</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test version 4.1.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2015.</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<p>There's a problem with opening roster entries with certain programmer types if you're using a language other than English.
For example, when the program is set to French language, it won't open the Comprehensive programmer.
This has been fixed in the development builds. As a (not very good) workaround, please leave the program set to English.</p>

<p>Once you've configured one or more connections, you get various errors if you try to remove them and run JMRI without a connection.
This has been improved, but not entirely fixed, in the development builds.  As a workaround, you can create a new profile
without any connections.</p>

<p>Backgrounds to labels and icons on control panels will occasionally display incorrectly.
Memory variable icons may also display an "X" marker at incorrect times.  
This is fixed in <a href="jmri4.1.5.shtml">JMRI 4.1.5</a>.

<p>
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.1.5.shtml">JMRI 4.1.5</a>, due out in early December,
or pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<p>The Digitrax PR2 does not work with this release.  If you need to work with a 
PR2, please stay with <a href="jmri4.1.3.shtml">JMRI 4.1.3</a> or earlier,
or wait for <a href="jmri4.3.1.shtml">JMRI 4.3.1</a> which should appear in December 2015.

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>The configuration is now stored in multiple files within a directory named <code>profile</code> inside a 
    Configuration Profile instead of within the file <code>ProfileConfig.xml</code>. PanelPro and DecoderPro both should migrate from the old configuration to the new configuration seamlessly. See JMRI <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/69#issuecomment-155385101">Issue #69</a> for more details. Please report any issues at <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/new">our GitHub project</a>.</p>

<a id="decoderSchema" name="decoderSchema"></a>
<p>The <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/schema/decoder.xsd">XML schema</a>
    for decoder files has been made more precise. 
    This shouldn't effect people who just use the JMRI decoder definitions as distributed,
    because they all work with this more precise version.  But if you have decoder
    definitions of your own, you may have to update them.
    Specifically, the decoder file verification will now reject a few things that it didn't catch before, even though they didn't really work:
    <ul>
    <li>There can be only one label element for a given language on a given variable.
    <li>A variable element has to contain just one type element such as decVal, enumVal, etc.
    </ul>
    As a side effect of checking this, the qualifier elements inside a variable now have to
    be at the front of the contents, and the label, comment and tooltip elements have to be 
    at the back. You can't just sprinkle them around and hope the code finds them
    (because sometimes in the past the program would miss one; now we require an order we're
    sure the code will understand).

</p>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.0.shtml">JMRI 4.0 release note</a> for warnings predating the 4.1 development series.

<p>This is the second JMRI version build from our shiny new
    <a href="https://github.com/JMRI">GitHub repository</a>.
    For more information on this, please see our
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">documentation page</a>.

<!-- retain through 4.2 -->

<p>Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan requires signed drivers for USB adapters. If you've upgraded
    from an earlier version, your drivers may not work.  That will cause JMRI to throw errors
    when it doesn't find communications links.  To fix this, go to the web site for your
    adapter manufacturer, find the drivers that are listed to work with Mac OS X 10.9 or later,
    download, and install, then retry JMRI again.

<p>RFID readers using the Olimex protocol were incorrectly decoding tag values - this has
    now been fixed. If you were using Olimex RFID readers with earlier versions, your existing
    ID Tag database will contain invalid tags. New ID Tag entries will be generated for each
    correctly read tag - this will require that any additional information be re-entered and,
    optionally, old invalid entries manually deleted.</p>

<p>Jython has been upgraded to version 2.7.0 with the following potentially breaking changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The decodeJmriFilename() function is no longer available by default. Use the  FileUtil.getExternalFilename() method instead.</li>
      <li>The simple propertyListener object is no longer available by default. Create your own, following the examples provided in the jython folder in the JMRI distribution.</li>
      <li>jmri_defaults.py included in the JMRI distribution is no longer executed by default, but will be executed before any other Jython scipts if included in your User Files location.</li>
      <li>The default behavior of python.cachedir.skip is now true. If using a custom python.properties file, include "python.cachedir.skip=false" in that file.</li>
      <li>Certain Python scripts are too large to be evaluated in Jython. If a script fails with the <code>java.io.IOException: Mark invalid</code> error, set "jython.exec=true" in a custom python.properties file or rewrite the script to be less than 100,000 characters per file. Note that when using "jython.exec=true" it may be desirable to run the included script jmri_bindings.py as a startup action to emulate the evaluation environment used when jython.exec=false.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  Definitions
    included with this release have been converted to the new form.
    If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
    validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
    Please ask on the JMRI Users group
    for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.</p>

<p>The OpenLCB 0.6.4 library in this version has a bug in its alias
    calculations which prevents JMRI from communicating occasionally.
    A patch has been submitted to the OpenLCB group.
    In the meantime, the workaround is to restart JMRI and/or the node
    and try again; that might allocate different alias values.</p>

                <li>Michael Mosher removed the non-existance CV139 from the non-sound TCS decoders</li>
            </ul>


   <h4>Operations</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Make some improvement to the train build report. Now when selecting detailed or very detailed "Router Detail Level",
    the program will show which spur / schedules are ignored when generating custom loads out of staging.</li>
    <li>Made some improvement to the train "Show Car Types Serviced" with regards to showing better messages when selecting
    a car and there are track destination restrictions for that car's track.</li>

   </ul>

    <h4>Scripting</h4>

            <li>The configuration is now stored in multiple files within a directory named <code>profile</code> inside a Configuration Profile instead of within the file <code>ProfileConfig.xml</code>. PanelPro and DecoderPro both should migrate from the old configuration to the new configuration seamlessly.  See <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/69#issuecomment-155385101">Issue #69</a> for more details.</li>
            <li> Improvements to the way TCP based network connections detect a disconnected server.</li>
        </ul>
