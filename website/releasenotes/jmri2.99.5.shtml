<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.0 production release, probably in Summer 2012.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>Two new switch list features.  You can now eliminate trains that don't have work from your switch lists.
    You can if you wish use a separate page for each train visiting a location.  See help for more info.</li>
    <li>You can now view a car's wait value in the Cars window.  Note that you need a schedule for this field
    to show up.</li>

    optionally select the car's train, destination, and comment.</li>
    <li>You can now print all of your routes from the "Tools" menu found in the routes window.</li>
    <li>Improved the train builder, you should see less final destinations assigned to cars that aren't part of the
    train</li>
    <li>You can now add a unique switch list comment for each location.</li>
    <li>New feature, auto backup.  When enabled, the program will make a backup copy of all operation
    files when the program starts.</li>
    <li>The Trains window now shows which staging track a train is departing or terminating on.</li>
    <li>New enhancement, you can now exclude trains or routes from spurs, interchanges, and staging tracks.</li>

    <li>Fixed a problem where routes could be deleted when the auto save feature was enabled</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>Kevin Dickerson made the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased the number items used to identify a roster entry in DP3 to include 
        Decoder manufacture, version and address type used.</li>
        <li>Added initial support for DCC4PC RailCom interface boards.  The interface is currently <b>not supported in Windows</b></li>
        <li>Added a script ("AllocateRosterEntryToBlock.py) that allows you to allocate a roster entry to a block</li>
        <li>Added in the ability to allow an Entry Exit become a variable condition to a Logix.</li>
        <li>Allow the following fields to be directly edited in the DP3 roster table, when the entry is not already opened
        <ul><li>ID Col</li>
            <li>Road Name</li>
            <li>Road Number</li>
            <li>Manufacturer</li>
            <li>Model</li>
            <li>Owner</li></ul>
            This does mean that the double click option to open the programmer can now only be performed on the DCC Address, Icon or Decoder Model columns</li>
        <li>Added the ability to hide columns in the Roster Entry Table</li>
        <li>Updated the turnout table so that column widths retain their size when extra columns are shown or hidden.</li>
        <li><b>Layout Editor</b><ul>
            <li>Update to the way that the single slip can operate to have either two or three different states.<li>
            <li>Allow the Logix for the signal allocated to a Slip to be recreated rather than skipped if it has
                already been created once, this allows for changes having been made at a later date on the slip for the turnout states.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem introduced in 2.99.4 with the saving/loading of a layout panel that had a
                level crossing included.</li>
            <li>Made some changes to the internal workings of the new Slips in the Layout Editor, this means that any added 
                in 2.99.4 will have to be re-created or put a request up on the JMRI Users group for assistance.</li>
            <li>Updated the memory icon in the panels so that if a roster entry is allocated against it, 
                the roster media icon is displayed (if available) or the roster title. If an icon and throttle is available the icon will flip to match the direction</li>
            <li>Added in ability to the layout editor to hide turnouts when not in editing mode</li>
            <li>Added the ability to update a block value by changing the corresponding memory value from the panel</li>
            <li>Added in the ability to change which memory object a memory labels points to if a change is made from the edit layout block GUI.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
  <p>Randall Wood made the following changes to web services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Replace the Mini Web Server with a Jetty-based Web Server</li>
    <li>Add a Roster servlet that handles most roster-based operations</li>
    <li>Updated the index.html file to be more operations-oriented</li>
    <li>Added a Panel servlet that provides a partial panel XML file with correct URLs for remote panel widgets</li>
    <li>Streamlined existing servlets to make feature expansion easier in the future</li>
  </ul>

<p>Steve Todd made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Change JmriJFrameServlet (web server click handler) to handle Layout Editor panels with background images.</li>
    <li>on WiT server stop, explicitly close throttles prior to closing socket.</li>
