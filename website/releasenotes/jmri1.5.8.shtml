      Release Notes for JMRI 1.5.8 test release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: June 16, 2005</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.5.8 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier version.

<p>This is intended to be the last test release before the version 1.6 production release. We hope that will happen very soon, so your prompt feedback on this test release would be appreciated.

<h3>New warnings for this test version:</h3>

<p>(none)

<h3>Older warnings for the 1.5 series of test versions:</h3>

<p>Paul Bender corrected sensor addressing for Lenz XPressNet in version 1.5.7. Unfortunately, this change will require modifications to existing panels used with XPressNet;  Users will need to add 8 to the number of any existing XPressNet Sensor.  Alternately, users can change the address in hardware by subtracting 1 from the LR10x address.

<p>The CT Electonik decoders have been reworked and renamed in version 1.5.6. Users of these decoders (only) need to reread their roster or manually edit their roster.xml-file when they move from a version earlier than 1.5.6.

<p>The method for configuring the C/MRI protocol has changed since version 1.4.  If you use the C/MRI protocol, you will have to reconfigure your preferences the first time you run this version.

<h3>Changes since test version 1.5.7:</h3>

<p>Improved display of rotated icons on panels to avoid artifacts; bug 1198825 (Howard Penny)

<p>Fixed bug 1189948: The state of a CV in the CV table model will change if the cursor is moved from one value to another even though the value has not really changed. (Howard Penny)

<p>Fixed bug 1214881: Extra debugging output present when printing the roster summary (Bob Jacobsen)

<p>Fixed bug 1216553: BLD16 programmer buttons say "SE8" instead of "BDL16" (but still work right)

<p>Fixed problem writing multiple CVs in ops mode on LocoNet (bug 1218980 and also feature request 1083398)

<p>Fixed problem with DecoderPro "read all panes" and "write all panes", which would only do the 1st pane (new in 1.5.7).  Also, fixed problem with certain errors during read/write of CVs not being retried.

<p>Includes updates by Walter Thompson so that custom programmers aren't needed for certain decoders.

<p>Alex Shepherd improved the Windows startup scripts (.bat files) so that they'll take multiple arguments.  The first argument, if present is the name of a configuration file within the standard preferences directory.

<p>Updates to the Windows installer, in Yet Another Attempt to work well with more than one Java version installed on Windows, etc.

<p>Howard Penny and Walter Thompson improved the layout of the Comprehensive programmer.

<p>Fixed a problem recreating the roster index, where it would fail if there were any non-roster XML files in the roster directory.

<p>Dick Bronson contributed a set of photos of US&amp;S lamps for use on panels.  These can be found in resources/icons/USSpanels/Lamps, with the old ones moved to Lamps-old.

<p>Improved the advanced preference for relocating roster information:  Fixed a bug that prevented it from working if the default programmer was set.  Improved the labelled and added explicit checks to make it clear that you have to select a "roster.xml" file during the file selection dialog.  Added a dialog box to explain what's going on.
