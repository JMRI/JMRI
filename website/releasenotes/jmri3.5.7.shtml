<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is (hopefully) the last in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.6 production release around the end of the year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.5.6:</h3>
   
   <p>Dan Boudreau fixed a problem that was preventing people from printing just
    certain pages or page ranges.</p>
    
   <p>Dan Boudreau fixed a problem with the track table columns for loads and roads.  The table is displayed when editing a location,
   and now you can quickly see if a track has a car road, load, or destination restriction.</p>
