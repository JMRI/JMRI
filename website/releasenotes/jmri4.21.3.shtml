      Release Notes for JMRI 4.21.3 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: December 18, 2020</p>
    <p>From: (pumpkin)</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.21.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please 
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release in early 2021.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.20, please follow these instructions carefully:

<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>? 
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on. 
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    then it's <u>very important</u> 
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later relese.
    </li>
    
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>? 
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release. 

</ol>   
 
Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues 
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.19.6.shtml">JMRI 4.19.6</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
   
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.3.shtml">JMRI 4.21.3</a></span>
        The Layout Editor code has been substantially restructured in this release.
        If you have scripts that reference the jmri.jmrit.display.layoutEditor package
        please check them carefully, as new classes have been created and 
        some methods have moved.  Panel files containing Layout Editor panels
        that are stored (written out) by this release may not be readable 
        by earlier releases; this release should load older files just fine.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.20.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.20 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.21 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>
installing this test release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21,1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo class has become a jmri.SystemConnectionMemo
        interface and a jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo class. This may
        require changes to scripts.  If you have a script that references
        jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo, please change it to either
        jmri.SystemConnectionMemo or jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo
        (it's easier to have you just try the two than to explain which 
        one will work in which case)
    </li>
    
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The way preferences are loaded at startup has been slightly
        modified.  There is no impact to JMRI applications, but Non-JMRI
        applications that are not derived from apps.Apps or apps.AppsBase
        but are using jmri.implementation.JmriConfigurationManager to load
        preferences will no longer see preferences if an error occurs.  To
        restore the old behavior, use apps.AppsConfigurationManager instead.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.1.shtml">JMRI 4.19.1</a></span>
        The <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        calls in the various <code>Manager</code> classes
        are no longer needed with Java 8 and have been deprecated for eventual
        removal.  Their replacements are 
        <code>getByUserName</code> and <code>getBySystemName</code> 
        respectively. 
        If you use <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        in script or Java code you've written, please 
        switch to the new names.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
        There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
            <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
            <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
            <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
            <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
        </ul>
        Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
        open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri4.21.2.shtml">Test Release 4.21.2</a>:</h2>
 
The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=milestone%3A4.21.3+is%3Amerged">list of included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>CBUS now has its own trademark and is referred to as CBUS, not 'MERG CBUS'.</li>
                <li>CBUS RFID Reporters now act similar to other JMRI Reporters, ie with a timeout following the report.</li>
                <li>CBUS Reporters can set a Sensor to follow the active IDTag status, set via CBUS Reporter Table.</li>
                <li>CBUS Reporters will default to classic RFID ( 5 byte unique tags ), with option for in-development CANRC522 / CANRCOM format, set via CBUS Reporter Table.</li>
                <li>Refer to MERG section of this not for changes in JMRI support for MERG hardware.</li>
                <li>Restructured help pages to reflect split between MERG specific hardware and hardware agnostic CBUS features.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>C/MRI</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>CMRI SerialSensor updated to support multiple Character system name prefixes.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Internal</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Sensor, Turnout, Light and Reporter Address ranges do not have to be fully numeric, and will be incremented using the final number in an address.<br>
                For example, a range can be created from "My Yard 77 Sensor 1" which would increment to "My Yard 77 Sensor 2"</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The legacy LocoIO programmer help points to the current <a href="diy">DIY decoder</a> method to
              configure these boards.</li>
              <li>LocoNet support for "Voltage/Current Meters" has been extended to
                  include support for multiple sources of meter information, and
                  to include automatic discovery of LocoNet devices which support
                  voltage and current reporting.  Each discovered device is identified
                  by its device type and serial number.  These "friendly" identifiers
                  appear in the "Voltage Meter" and "Current Meter" menus in the
                  "Voltage/Current Meter" tool. Further information may be found at the
                  <a href="/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/DigitraxMeters.shtml">
                      Digitrax "Meters"</a> web page.</li>
                <li>Start-up "Interrogation" of LocoNet Sensor and Turnout state
                    has re-worked to provide better operation for LocoNet connections
                    with large numbers of Sensors and/or Turnouts.  The JMRI
                    interrogation mechanism now implements a minimum delay from
                    the last Sensor Report, Turnout Report or Interrogate Query
                    message before sending the next Interrogate Query message.</li>
                <li>The "DS64 Configuration Tool" was updated:
                    <ul>
                        <li>to correctly perform the "Factory Reset" operation
                            without encountering a "Java Exception";</li>
                        <li>to correctly perform the "Factory Reset" operation to
                            the correct DS64 as specified in the "Unit Address" field;</li>
                        <li>to correctly manage the values shown on the "OpSw Values"
                            tab and maintain value coherency between the "OpSw Values" tab
                            and the "Basic Settings" tab.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Keep slot status in line with CS after setting COMMON or true slot moves</li>
                <li>Allow selection of "Stand-alone LocoNet (with external LocoNet Data
                    Termination!)" for Digitrax PR4.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Maple</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Maple SerialSensor updated to support multiple Character system name prefixes.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MERG</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>CBUS now has its own trademark and is referred to as CBUS, not 'MERG CBUS'.</li>
                <li>Refer to CBUS section of this not for changes in JMRI support for CBUS.</li>
                <li>Restructured help pages to reflect split between MERG specific hardware and hardware agnostic CBUS features.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added support for creating ranges of Turnouts and Lights.<br>
                Sensor, Turnout and Light Address ranges do not have to be fully numeric,
                and will be incremented using the final number in an address.</li>
                <li>Added support for changing the default quality of service and
                retention policy for transmissions.  See the
                <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/SetMqttOptions.py">jython/SetMqttOptions.py</a>
                script for an example.</li>
                <li>Fix a nasty threading bug in the MQTT Light support that can
                cause a JMRI lockup on the first access after adding a Light.</li>

                <li>Update the Paho MQTT library from version 0.4.0 to 1.2.5 (current)</li>
                <li>Better handling of wildcards in topic subscriptions</li>
            </ul>


        <h4>RFID</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Network connections: Support added for auto-reconnect.</li>
                <li>Network connections: TCP/UDP port configuration option promoted to main configuration settings panel and no longer under Additional Connection Settings.</li>
            </ul>


        <h4>SPROG DCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>EStop for 28 Step mode is now sent correctly</li>
		<li>Updated programming mode switcher for Pi-SPROG 3</li>
		<li>Added mode switcher for SPROG 3 Plus</li>

        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
	        <li>The Layout Editor code has been substantially restructured in this release.
	            If you have scripts that reference the jmri.jmrit.display.layoutEditor package

	        </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Logix</h3>
        <a id="Logix" name="Logix"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The "Copy Logix" feature has been enhanced to provide more assistance
          in copying conditionals. See the updated help files for details.</li>

          <li>Fixed a couple of bugs there Logix wasn't correctly listening on
          signal head lunar state, signal head flash lunar state, signal mast

          <li>Switchboards immediately update after a change in shapes, types, connection or range. The [Update
            Switchboard] button is still available, and occasionally required.</li>
          <li>Switches display the user name on the switches (default On for new boards, set "Show user name on
            switches" in the Options menu.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix issue where Jynstrument would not start correctly <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/topic/78674589">(user group message)</a>.</li>
            <li>Added a throttle frame Jynstrument that hides throttle window menubar and toolbar and switches to semitransparent mode (and vice versa) (idea from <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/topic/76582490">this user message</a>).</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The table of throttle commands shown when creating or editing warrants has been changed:
            	<ul>
            		<li>The <b>Command</b> column is now a drop down combo box. This will allow the
            			command names to be translated into languages other than English.</li>
            	    <li>The <b>Value</b> column is a drop down combo box for throttle commands
            	    	other than "Speed" or "Run Warrant". Again, done to permit translation
            	    	into other languages.</li>
            	</ul>
            </li>
            <li>The algorithm for executing speed changes due to track conditions for warrants
                has been modified and is better able to restore the scripted speeds once the
                track speed restrictions are lifted.</li>
            <li>The constant used to approximate track speed of trains has been changed to 
            	yield a scale speed of 100mph at full throttle. This change has <b>no effect</b>
            	on roster entries having Speed Profiles.</li>
            <li>The Address column of the Warrant Table list and the Address fields of the
            	NXWarrant or Create Warrant windows
            	now accept throttle protocol names and addresses of Markin and ESU ECoS.</li>
            <li>When scripted speeds are overridden due to signals or obstructions ahead, the  
            	non-speed script commands are executed at approximately the same elapsed times as  
            	were written in the script.</li>
 			<li>Track speeds of running warrants are recorded automatically and a SpeedProfile  
            	is built that can be seen by  pressing the <b>View Profile</b> button in the
            	edit warrant window. These profiles can be merged into the existing profiles
            	for the Roster entry used by the loco of the warrant when the layout session 
            	is closed. (Recall that Warrant Preferences has 3 options for this merging.)</li>
            <li>An <b>Update Track Speeds</b> button is added to the window where warrant throttle
            	settings and commands are edited. This button updates the <b>Speed</b> column to
            	list the track speeds (mm/sec) for the current Speed Profile measurements of
            	the locomotive address entered in the 'Engine Consist' box.</li>           	
            <li>Bugs introduced during the past year to the 'Wait Sensor' command and merging of 
            	speed profiles are fixed.</li>          	
			<li>When OBlocks are imported from LayoutEditor blocks, the turnout settings of paths 
            	are also added to the imported OPaths.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Where Used</h3>
        <a id="WhereUsed" name="WhereUsed"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement data collection for CTC references for sensors, signal heads,
            signal masts, turnouts and blocks.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Switchboard panels on Web Server support all graphic shapes and colors set in the Editor.</li>
            <li>Switchboard "switch" icons fill the whole screen on mobile devices (you can turn this off in Switchboard
              Editor by deselecting "Automatically set optimum grid" in the Options menu.</li>
            <li>Switchboard panels for Lights allow to switch all lights on or off (also in Web Server when Panel
              items control layout is selected in the Editor Options menu).</li>
            <li>Control Panel track colors (Allocated, Not In Use, ...) are now fully supported on Web Server
              panels.</li>
            <li>OBlocks access was added as a JSON Servlet to allow this.</li>
        </ul>


   <h3>Meters and MeterFrames</h3>
        <a id="Meters" name="Meters"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>jmri.MultiMeter is split into jmri.Meter.</li>
            <li>jmri.VoltageMeter and jmri.CurrentMeter is added.</li>
            <li>AmpMeterFrame and VoltMeterFrame are replaced by MeterFrame</li>
            <li>The user can select which VoltageMeter/CurrentMeter the MeterFrame should show</li>
            <li>The MeterFrames are stored in the panel file and restored when the panel is loaded</li>
            <li>LocoNet supports discovery of the sources of voltage and current
                data and makes them available in the "Voltage/Current Meter" tool.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>AbstractProxyManager</h3>
        <a id="Proxy" name="Proxy"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>AbstractProxyManager can now automatically create system specific managers.</li>
            <li>When a NamedBean is added to a proxy manager, there needs to be a system specific
			manager for that bean unless the bean is for the internal manager. The ProxyMeterManager
			and AbstractProxyManager automatically creates a new system specific manager if it doesn't
			already exists. This works as long as the system specific manager doesn't need to have
			system specific knowledge of the named beans.</li>
            <li>This means that, for example, the user may create a Jython script that creates a Meter
			for the LocoNet connection but doesn't need to create the LocoNet meter manager since that
			manager is automatically created.</li>
			<li>Once a specific connection needs to store specific data about meters, a connection
			specific manager needs to be created, for example LnMeterManager for LocoNet.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows launcher updated to honour return codes to shutdown or reboot host machine</li>
            <li>The Ant version invoked by Maven was bumped to 1.10.8.  No user
                action required, but developers need to be online the first time
                they build using Maven.</li>
            <li>The (English) phrasing in a couple of messages was updated for consistency.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
