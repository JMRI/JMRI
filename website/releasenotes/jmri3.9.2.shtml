<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the second in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>
<p>RFID support has been changed to allow for additional protocols - existing
   CORE-ID readers <em>should</em> remain unaffected but, in certain
   circumstances, it may be necessary to update connection configuration with 
   the correct protocol.</p>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<p>None at the time of this release.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.9.1:</h3>

<p><b>This is the first series of JMRI to support the MRC command stations
via the Prodigy USB computer interface.</b></p>

<p>The roster table is now smarter about sorting columns if they contain numbers (instead of alphanumeric names).

<p>ARM V7 processor libraries added, so this architecture should work out-of-the-box on Linux.

<p>The format of the mask value in XML decoder definitions is now included in validity checking. The existing decoder
definitions had a few problems with this, now fixed.

<p>
Configuration XML files (Store Panels, Store Configuration Only) are now written
with the line-ends standard on the local machines.

<p><b>This is the first series of JMRI to support the Roco Z21 command stations via it's built in network connection.</b></p>

<h4>System Support</h4>
<h5>RFID</h5>
<p>The current implementation has been refactored to better facilitate the support of additional
   protocols. Whilst this <em>should</em> not affect the existing CORE-ID readers, it may be necessary
   to update connection configuration with the correct protocol. (Matthew Harris)</p>
<p>Initial support has been added for RFID readers that use the Olimex protocol.
   Many thanks to George Bowler for testing with real hardware. (Matthew Harris)</p>
<p>Initial support has been added for RFID readers that use the Parallax protocol. (Matthew Harris)</p>

<h5>OpenLCB</h5>
The OpenLCB support has been updated to the most recent version of the specifications.
The most noticeable effect will be faster and cleaner operation of the configuration (CDI-using) tools.

<h5>Roco Z21</h5>
<p> Initial support has been added for the Roco Z21.  Current support includes XPressNet tunneling only.  Thanks to Bill Lang for testing with real hardware. (Paul Bender)</p>

<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>
<p>There's now an "exists" qualifier for use in decoder definition files.</p>

<p>A user-defined pane with the same pane name as a standard programmer pane will replace that pane. (Dave Heap)</p>

<p>Added CT Elektronik DCX33 and DCX74 (v26) definitions (Alain Le Marchand)</p>
<p>Added Doehler &amp; Haass DHF250 definition (Alain Le Marchand)</p>
<p>Pierre Billon improved the Doehler &amp; Haass FH05A definition.</p>
<p>Fixed Kuehn N025/T125/T145 definition (CV55) and refactored definition file and panes (Alain Le Marchand)</p>
<p>Added Soundtraxx Tsunami SoundCar DSD definition (Alain Le Marchand)</p>
<p>Updated (Soundtraxx) Bachmann SoundValue for SD70ACe &amp; GEVO ES44AC. Added GG1 (Alain Le Marchand)</p>
<p>Added Uhlenbrock Sound Module 32300 definition and updated 32100 (Alain Le Marchand)</p>

<h4>Scripting</h4>

<p>There's now a decodeJmriFilename(..) helper routine for use in Jython scripts.
See the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/scripting/FAQ.shtml">scripting FAQ</a> for more info.

<p>Fixed some problems in C/MRI-specific sample scripts.

<p>Brett Scott provided updated versions of the <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/dccspecialties/">DCC Specialities scripts</a>
for the Wabbit et al.

<p>Robin Becker updated the IO Action options in the Tam Valley Quad LN_S decoder definition.

<h4>Operations</h4>
 <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Added the ability to print or preview a single location from the "Edit Location" window.</li>
   <li>Alternate track for a spur now works without schedules or custom loads</li>
   <li>Improved manifests tab spacing when using the truncated mode and printing headers</li>
   <li>Some minor improvements in the build report when using the "Detailed" setting.</li>
   <li>Fixed the car and locomotive edit attribute windows when the font size is set to 18.</li>
   <li>Improved how the program deals with the alternate track and car routing.</li>
   <li>You can now add the lead locomotive number to a train's description.
