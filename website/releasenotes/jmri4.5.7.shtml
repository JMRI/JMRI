      Release Notes for JMRI 4.5.7 release
      </h2>

    <p>Date: Nov 30, 2016</p>
    <p>From: Matthew Harris</p>
    <p>Subject: Test version 4.5.7 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>-->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2016.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<ul>
<li>When a Digitrax DCS240 is the command station, JMRI throttles may not be able to take control 
	of a locomotive or consist in some cases if the DCS240 "expanded slots" (i.e. 400 slots) feature is in use. 
	Be sure to "dispatch" or "release" locomotives and consists from throttles which use "expanded 
	slots" before attempting to acquire the locomotive or consist via a JMRI throttle, as this may 
	enable JMRI to acquire the locomotive or consist.  This problem can affect throttles which 
	use the JMRI WiThrottle interface and throttles controlled via the JMRI Web Server.  This issue
	is thought to be present in all previous versions of JMRI.</li>
<li>DCC++ connections on Linux may not work.</li>
</ul>


If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.5.8.shtml">JMRI 4.5.8</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.4.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.4 release note</a> for warnings predating the 4.4 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.6)</em> 
        As part of fixing the 
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/2081">TMCC throttle issue</a>,
        the handling of TMCC preferences was changed.  If you have a TMCC
        connection configured, please go to the 
        "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Connection">Defaults</a>"
        pane in the Preferences window and make sure that the 
        TMCC connection is selected for the appropriate device types.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.5)</em> 
        Apple has released a new "Sierra" version of macOS (formerly known as OS X) which has
        enhanced security for downloaded programs.  We're providing a new form of signed download
        to work with this, see below.  We'd be interested to hear whether that download
        works on older OS versions, so that we can just release this new form
        without having to provide separate downloads.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.2)</em>This and future versions of JMRI may not function on OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. OS X
    operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
    user's group.
    <p>To remove Java SE 6 from OS X, follow these steps (these steps assume
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>, if not,
      adjust the following paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command <code>/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh</code> It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
          It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
        </li>
      <li><em>El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  
<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.2)</em>Support for directly executing AppleScript within JMRI has been removed
    due to changes in macOS and Java outside our control. If you require the
    ability to use AppleScript, you may be able to add this capability on your
    own by visiting <a href="https://jmri.github.io/applescript">JMRI
      AppleScript Support</a>, but please be aware that this may not work
    on upcoming releases of macOS or Java.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.1)</em>LocoTools, no longer supported since JMRI 2.10, has been removed from the Linux and OS X distributions.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.1)</em>Internal turnouts and sensors need to have complete, individual system names.
    The names "IT" and "IS" (without any suffix) are no longer permitted:
    "IT12" is fine, but just "IT" is not. Most panel files that contain these should
    automatically migrate them to new names when saved, but in some cases you might need to manually update them.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.3.5)</em> When sharing a configuration between this version and JMRI 4.3.4 or older, the older version of JMRI will not
    reflect changes in preferences, window position, table sorting, column order, or other user interface state. This is due to
    changes in how user preferences and interface state are stored.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.3.3)</em> You can now set the order of your startup items: If you're opening panel files, running scripts, etc as
    the program starts up, there's a preferences pane that lets you easily set the order in which those happen.
    If you've set the order manually (e.g. by editing configuration files) in the past, please check this
    preference to make sure it's set the way you want.</p>

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.1.2)</em> Jython has been upgraded to version 2.7.0 with the following potentially breaking changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The decodeJmriFilename() function is no longer available by default. Use the  FileUtil.getExternalFilename() method instead.</li>
      <li>The simple propertyListener object is no longer available by default. Create your own, following the examples provided in the jython folder in the JMRI distribution.</li>
      <li>jmri_defaults.py included in the JMRI distribution is no longer executed by default, but will be executed before any other Jython scipts if included in your User Files location.</li>
      <li>The default behavior of python.cachedir.skip is now true. If using a custom python.properties file, include "python.cachedir.skip=false" in that file.</li>
      <li>Certain Python scripts are too large to be evaluated in Jython. If a script fails with the <code>java.io.IOException: Mark invalid</code> error, set "jython.exec=true" in a custom python.properties file or rewrite the script to be less than 100,000 characters per file. Note that when using "jython.exec=true" it may be desirable to run the included script jmri_bindings.py as a startup action to emulate the evaluation environment used when jython.exec=false.</li>
    </ul>

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.1.1)</em> Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  Definitions
    included with this release have been converted to the new form.
    If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
    validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
    Please ask on the JMRI Users group
    for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.</p>

<h3>Changes since <a href="jmri4.5.6.shtml">test release 4.5.6</a>:</h3>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aclosed&q=milestone%3A4.5.7+">list of included commits</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.

 <h4>Hardware Support</h4>		

          <h5>OpenLCB</h5>		
             <ul>		
                 <li>User interface improvements in the Configuration		
                 dialog. The dialog will now use an advanced and much faster		
                 algorithm to load the initial values of the configuration from		
                 the hardware. Users should not need to use the "Read All"		
                 button anymore. Changed values are now highlighted in similar		
                 way as DecoderPro does. The configuration dialog opens		
                 immediately and shows the progress as the XML data is		
                 downloaded via the network. It is also possible to re-try		
                 loading if the first load fails. A cache allows opening the		
                 same dialog instantly for the second time.</li>		
                 <li>Fixed a software problem that lead to multiple issues when		
                 CPU load is high, such as failed firmware downloads or		
                 inability to open the configuration dialog. On some systems it		
                 was enough to have the OpenLCB Monitor window open to trigger		
                 the problem.</li>		
             </ul>

    <h4>Layout Editor</h4>		
         <ul>		
             <li>Fixed a problem with adding Train/loco icons to the panel</li>		
          </ul>
          
    <h4>Signals</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed an issue to set aspects in the Signal Mast Table using the combobox. Sorting rows or moving columns in the table is fully supported.</li>
        </ul>

   <h4>Warrants</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A bug when Calibrating a throttle speed factor in NXWarrants has been fixed.</li>
            <li>SCWarrants are converted to regular Warrants with a "No Ramping" flag set.  Such warrants change speed as before upon entering
            	the approach block. Now they use the speeds specified by the signals rather than one hard coded value. The new "No Ramping" flag
            	may be turned off and on in the Warrant Editing window.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The MS Windows launcher has had a number of updates including:
                <ul>
                    <li>a new method to calculate the maximum memory</li>
                    <li>use the Windows look and feel as an initial default</li>
                    <li>allow the classpath to be modified by either appending `--cp:a=CLASSPATH` or prepending `--cp:p=CLASSPATH`</li>
                    <li>allow for default options to be specified in a `jmri.conf` file stored in `%userprofile%\JMRI`
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
