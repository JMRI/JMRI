      Release Notes for JMRI 3.2.1 release (3.2-r21862)
      </h2>

	<p>Date: December 16, 2012</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Production version 3.2-r21862 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

This is a new production release which contains a few small updates to JMRI 3.2.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

This release requires Java 1.6.

<p>
To allow use of UTF-8 characters (special characters with accents, Japanese text, etc) in XML
files, particularly decoder definitions, the default file encoding has been changed to UTF-8.
This requires a change to the startup scripts distributed with JMRI.
If you're just using the JMRI-provided startup tools, you should be all set.
This was done in JMRI 3.1.7, so if you installed that or any later release, you're OK now.
If you're using your own custom startup scripts, 
you need to add a "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" option to them. 

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since production release 3.2</h3>

Fixed a problem with MS100 mode. Note that MS100 is only available on
certain older Windows machines; this fix doesn't change that, just
restores some function lost in JMRI 3.2. In the long run, you need
to replace your MS100 with something from this century.

Fixed an issue that correctly registers the command station in the instance manager for the
Hornby Elite, which caused a problem when trying to add Signal Heads.

LocoNetOverTCP - Fix an issue with the connection details that prevented it from being loaded.
