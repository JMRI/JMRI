      Release Notes for JMRI 1.3.9 developer release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: Feb 16, 2004</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.3.9 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for
      download.</p>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
	<ul>

	<li>This is a test release.</li>
	<li>Please post a note if you encounter any
	new or old bugs!</li>
	<li>Please back up your JMRI files before
	installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier
	version.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>New warnings:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Some Windows XP users are still experiencing a problem saving
	    the preferences. If you encounter this, please get in touch
	    directly.</li>

	<li>There is no OS/2 version of this test release because our OS/2
	test machine is no longer online.  If you have a suitable OS/2
	machine and are willing to host our release testing, please let me
	know.</li>

	<li>If you are building your own copy of the program from the source
	code using Ant, please make sure to update the build.xml file.
	There have been some changes in the build procedure during the
	1.3.9 build.</li>

	</ul>

	<h3>Older warnings for the 1.3 series of test versions:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>These downloads are significantly larger than version 1.3.5 and
	previous.  This is due to the addition of a help system starting in
	test version 1.3.8.</li>

	<li>LocoNet sensor numbering has been changed starting in version
	1.3.4!  This will effect people who have panel files (.xml files
	containing panel definition) for LocoNet block occupancy sensors.
	The sensor numbers now start with 1, not 0, so you'll have to edit
	the panel files to change e.g. LS0 to LS1, LS23 to LS24, etc.  This
	does not effect input via other (non-LocoNet) protocols, including
	C/MRI, NCE AIU, etc.  If you use LocoNet sensor numbers for the
	Speedometer, you'll have to increase them by one also.</li>

	<li>If you have pre-1.2.3 roster entries that use Zimo decoder
	definitions, you'll have to recreate them.  The Zimo decoder
	definitions have been completely reworked in a better organization
	starting with test version 1.2.3.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Changes since test version 1.3.9:</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>XpressNet connection can now be made via an XPA telephone
	adapter &amp; modem (Paul Bender)</li>

	<li>Tooltips can now be added to items in the decoder definition
	files.  If present, they override the definitions in the programmer
	definition file.</li>

	<li>Phil Grainger added the Digitrax DH83FX decoder, and the needed
	5th output function to the Digitrax "Basic" decoder
	definition.</li>

	<li>Robin Becker updated the Soundtraxx LC Steam and Diesel decoder
	definitions</li>

	<li>Wayne Eric provided a decoder definition for the MRC AD370
	sound decoder.</li>

	<li>Ian Havercroft updated the version identification in ESU
	decoders so they successfully identify.</li>

	<li>Digitrax DZ123 definition added, with ident info courtesy
	Robert Johnson</li>

	<li>Jack Shall updated the Lenz 80 decoder file.</li>

	<li>DH163 can now do direct-bit mode programming</li>

	<li>Fix problem with creating two copies of roster entries, Bug
	871882</li>

	<li>Allow multi-line comments in roster comment fields:  Dennis
	Miller</li>

	<li>New NCE D13SR Torque Compensation decoder file from Michael
	Mosher</li>

	<li>Panes from decoder files (but not programmer files) are active
	even if they contain no variables (Requested by Manhart
	Matthias)</li>

	<li>LocoNet Throttles were behaving poorly in version 1.3.8, with
	the speed slider not moving correctly.  Fixed.</li>

	<li>Fix problem with not prompting to save file when closing window
	after changing a speed table entry, bug 881556</li>

	<li>Better diagnostics if a LocoNet RMI connection (LocoNet
	server/client) fails (RFE 874488)</li>

	<li>Peter Brandenburg has contributed a new
	CT_Elektronik_Sound_GE_70_80 decoder definition file.</li>

	<li>Fixed bug 874472 causing DecoderPro not to have a LocoNet menu
	when connected via a Loconet server</li>

	<li>Added size information to several more decoders. (Doesn't
	effect DecoderPro operations, but does appear on the selection web
	pages)</li>

	<li>Improved formatting of the throttle ID in the LocoNet Monitor
	(suggested by Glen Colbert)</li>

	<li>Added title to PowerPanel frame so that it's easier to find the
	icon</li>

	<li>Lenz LI100/LI101 connection has improved timeout logic, so that
	it doesn't slow the computer at startup</li>

	<li>New TCS M1 decoder definition from Eddie Delozier</li>

	<li>Paul Bender improved and extended the XPressnet configuration
	tools.</li>

	<li>Fixed a technical bug in the debug Programmer that would cause
	occasional intermittent test failures.</li>

	<li>Fix bug where programmer window would close even when close
	operation was cancelled during save</li>

	<li>Updated Ant control files to separate out development uses from
	the less-common functions, which improves build time</li>

	<li>Added sample scripts for a siglet and a simple automaton to the
	jython directory. Added PacketPro.bat for Windows. These features
	are still quite preliminary, as evidenced by a lack of
	documentation, and is certain to change.</li>
