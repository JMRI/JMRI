      Release Notes for JMRI 4.15.5 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: April 19, 2019</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.15.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release during early Summer 2019.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.11.9 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running OK before
        updating to this test release.  Once you have JMRI 4.12 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been a number of 
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    you <u>must</u> 
    update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to this release.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.11.3.shtml">JMRI 4.11.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>

<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
            <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.5.shtml">JMRI 4.15.5</a></span>
                The handling of Turnout system names has been updated
                to be (more, hopefully completely) consistent with the
                <a href="/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">planned approach</a>.
                Specifically, case now (generally) matters in system names:
                <ul>
                    <li>You can now have an internal turnout named "ITsome lower case name".
                    <li>But note you can no longer refer to "ITSOME LOWER CASE NAME" or
                        "ITSome LoWeR cAse Name" and get the same one.
                </ul>
                This should not require any migration for stored configurations or 
                panel files, as they have been automatically been being kept consistent 
                since JMRI 4.8.  But you might have case errors in i.e. scripts which
                will fixing inconsistent references in your scripts.
                <p>Of course, bugs are always possible. If you find a place where 
                names seem to be handled inconsistently, please let us know!
                </li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.14.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.14 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.15 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.4.shtml">JMRI 4.15.4</a></span>
        The calculation of Turnout Addresses for the
        <a href="/help/en/html/hardware/dccpp/Turnouts.shtml" target="_blank">
        Direct DCC Accessory Command ("a" command)</a> mode
        has been fixed (commands are now sent to the correct accessory address rather
        than 4 less than the nominated hardware address). For pre-existing panels,
        changes will need to be made to either the actual decoder address or the panel.
        If help is required, ask on the
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/" target="_blank">
        jmriusers</a> group.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.3.shtml">JMRI 4.15.3</a></span>
        The prefix that identifies a layout connection should be a single letter, like "N" or "L",
        or a letter and some digits, like "K2" or "D3". Some older systems used to have
        longer "legacy system prefixes" like "DX", "DCCPP", "DP", "MR", "MC", "PI", and "TM".
        Those <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">legacy system prefixes</a>
        will now cause JMRI to issues a warning at startup. In this release, JMRI will
        still work with those prefixes, but they will need to be migrated to the proper form soon;
        JMRI 4.17.1 and later will <u>require</u> that this have been fixed.
        Therefore, this warning can't be suppressed
        without migrating the prefix in the connection configuration (and any associated
        panel files and scripts).
        If you're getting this warning and therefore need to do that migration,
        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">migration page</a>.</li>

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li><br>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li><br>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li><br>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li><br>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li><br>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri4.15.4.shtml">Test release 4.15.4</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=milestone%3A4.15.5+is%3Amerged">list of included commits</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><p>JMRI's support for the Digitrax PR4 has been updated to
                    reflect the PR4's inability to provide
                    "LocoNet Data Signal termination". <span class="since">since
                    4.15.5</span></p>

                    <p>This is a correction to JMRI's previous implementation of
                    PR4 functionality.  It reflects a a more-accurate understanding
                    of PR4 features by the JMRI development team.</p>

                    <p>When configuring a JMRI "connection" for the PR4, the "Command
                    station type" of "Stand-alone LocoNet" is no longer available.
                    Users with an existing PR4 connection which has been configured
                    for a "Command station type" of "Stand-alone LocoNet" should
                    change their "Command station type" to some other selection,
                    such as "DCS100", and save the configuration profile.</p>

                    <p>Because LocoNet requires some source of "LocoNet Data Signal
                    termination", and because the PR4 is not capable of providing
                    that feature, it will be necessary to provide it using some
                    other piece of LocoNet hardware.  Both commercially-available and
                    do-it-yourself options are available, as described in the
                    "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/StandaloneLocoNet.shtml#dataterm">
                    LocoNet Data Signal termination</a>" section of the JMRI
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">
                    Standalone LocoNet</a>" help page.</p>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The updated MQTT support in this release
                    <ul>
                    <li>allows you to change the topic string used for publishing and subscribing and
                    <li>allows changing the payload
                    of MqttTurnouts, i.e. to use JSON instead of fixed strings.
                    </ul>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>
        <h4>ESU</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ESU LokSound decoder users can now read the loaded Sound Project Name
                    (and other decoder information) on the Information Pane.
                    <br><br>
                    This allows cross-referencing to the ESU website
                    (copy the "Loco Name" to search the Projects section) in order to
                    find the ESU bulletin and hence determine
                    Sound Slot and Function Key names. (Dave Heap)

            <ul>
                <li>A new CTC tool has been added to JMRI.  An Editor component uses
                a set of screens to define the CTC system.  The resulting data can
                be used to create a US&amp;S CTC Panel (Panel Editor) with all of the
                levers, indicators, and a minimal track plan with turnouts and
                signals.  A run time component uses the configuration to implement
                prototype CTC logic with no scripting or Logix.</li>

        <h4>Signal Masts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Better messages when a Turnout Signal Mast encounters errors

	    <h4>USS CTC Logic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated how lock information is
                    stored in the 'logging memory'
                    so that it can be displayed e.g.

            <li>The throttle settings generated for down ramps used by NXWarrants or speed changes required by signals, occupancy

            interval as specified in Warrant Preferences. Accuracy of the position where the train stops should be improved.
            </li>
            <li>A bug where looped routes ending at an adjacent block could be missed by the Find Route algorithm has been fixed.
            </li>
            <li>A stop button to halt execution of the Find Route Operation has been added.
            </li>
            <li>The dynamic recording of speeds during sessions has been extended. A weighted average of the speed over a block is recorded to
            the session speed profile.
            </li>
            <li>A bug where a Halt at zero speed would not restart has been fixed. Scripts now resume at any command where the user does a Halt.
            </li>
            <li>The "Run Warrant" command linking warrants now executes for all cases.
            </li>
            <li>A bug when dragging an unnamed Portal icon in CircuitBuilder might cause a freeze has been fixed.
            </li>
            <li>Deleting an OBlock will also delete all other elements (Portals and Paths using the block). Previously when saved after such editing,
            warrants referencing the block would re-register the OBlock when the panel was re-loaded. Now such warrants are loaded, but
            will indicate that editing is needed to establish a correct route for them.

            <li>Down ramps used by NXWarrants and are also used when speed changes required by signals, occupancy 
            	conditions or user interventions occur. The throttle settings generated for down ramps have been modified. 
            	The throttle setting is increased by 10% at each time interval. Also, the last throttle interval now is always the throttle
            	interval as specified in Warrant Preferences. Accuracy of the position where the train stops should be improved.

            <li>JSON protocol documentation updated. (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/6777">#6777</a>)</li>
            <li>JSON services no longer automatically listen for changes to objects provided to a client unless the client explicitly requests the object. (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/6777">#6777</a>)</li>
            <li>NamedBeans now allow property change listeners to listen only to specified properties. (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/6777">#6777</a>)</li>
