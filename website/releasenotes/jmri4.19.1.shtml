      Release Notes for JMRI 4.19.1 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: December 31, 2019</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.19.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please 
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release in early summer 2020.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.11.9 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running without errors 
        during startup or on the JMRI log.  
        Once you have JMRI 4.12 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
        you <u>must</u> 
        update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
        carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
        before updating to this release.
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.17.7 or earlier, including if the previous paragraphs
        convinced you to update to JMRI 4.12, 
        we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.18.shtml">JMRI 4.18</a> and make sure that's running without errors 
        during startup or on the JMRI log.
        Once you have JMRI 4.18 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been
        changes panel file format and configuration options since earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.18.shtml">JMRI 4.18</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>


<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>There have been reports of strange function key behavior.</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.11.3.shtml">JMRI 4.11.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

    <li>JMRI 4.19.1 and later enforce the standard form of system names,
        where the system is denoted by a single letter or a letter plus digits.
        Some users of JMRI 4.18 or earlier might have incompatible values.
        If you have one of these hardware connections:
        <ul>
            <li>Anyma DX512 using “DX”
            <li>DCC++ using “DCCPP"
            <li>DCC4PC using “DP"
            <li>JSON client using “json”
            <li>MRC using “MR"
            <li>Marklin CS2 using “MC"
            <li>Raspberry PI using “PI"
            <li>TAMS using “TM”
        </ul>
        you may have to migrate. Please update to JMRI 4.18 prior 
        to installing JMRI 4.19.1 (or later) and check the JMRI Console to
        see if there are any instructions there. See the 
        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">migration page</a>
        for additional information.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        calls in the various <code>Manager</code> classes
        are no longer needed with Java 8 and have been deprecated for eventual
        removal.  Their replacements are 
        <code>getByUserName</code> and <code>getBySystemName</code> 
        respectively. 
        If you use <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        in script or Java code you've written, please 
        switch to the new names.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.18.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.18 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.19 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<ul>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        JMRI's scripting support now defaults to the UTF-8 character encoding for all
        script files on all platforms. This may require that some scripts be re-saved
        using UTF-8.</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        <strong>Windows Only</strong> The JMRI installer removes the existing
        <em>lib</em> folder from a JMRI installation when upgrading JMRI. The
        existing lib folder contents are retained in the backup folder.
        <strong>This means that any files you have added to the <em>lib</em>
            folder will be removed.</strong></li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        <strong>macOS Only</strong> This version includes changes to how
        the final .dmg file is built, signed and notarized.  This was done to increase
        compatibility with macOS 10.15 Catalina.
        Please drag the JMRI icon to the Applications folder to install this release.
        For more information on 
        <a href="https://jmri.org/install/MacOSX.shtml#catalina">Catalina compatibility</a>,
        see the 
        <a href="https://jmri.org/install/MacOSX.shtml#catalina">JMRI web site</a>.

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.4.shtml">JMRI 4.17.4</a></span>
        Panel file NamedBean items such as Turnouts, Sensors, etc are now written to panel
        files in order by their Manager system prefix and system name.
        Previously, they had (roughly) been written in the order they'd be 
        read from the earlier file(s). This will result in a big change to the order
        the first time a file is re-written, but after that it should be much more stable.</li>
        
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

                where the system is denoted by a single letter or a letter plus digits.
                Some users of JMRI 4.18 or earlier might have incompatible values.
                See warnings above.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
	        <li>George Warner added "Align to grid" options</li>
	        <li>George Warner added the ability to rotate the Layout Editor display</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>
        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved how the XML files defining a signal system
                    are validated.  Unfortunately, some files are already inconsistent.
                    Fixed a number of files with invisible appearance definitions
                    by duplicating the appearance file (i.e. adding a -b version with
                    the different appearances).  Temporarily commented out 
                    some of the 
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/schema/appearancetable.xsd">schema checks</a>
                    until the existing files can be resolved.
                    </li>
                <li>Bob Milhaupt and Greg McCarthy updated the 
                    B&O semaphore,
                    NW-1981,
                    SOU-1981 and 
                    WM-1980 signal systems to correct some internal inconsistencies.
                    </li>
            </ul>


    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The JMRI Demo shortcut has been removed from Windows installs</li>
            <li>
                The <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
                calls in the various <code>Manager</code> classes
                are no longer needed with Java 8 and have been deprecated for eventual
                removal.  Their replacements are 
                <code>getByUserName</code> and <code>getBySystemName</code> 
                respectively. 
                If you use <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
                in script or Java code you've written, please 
                switch to the new names.
