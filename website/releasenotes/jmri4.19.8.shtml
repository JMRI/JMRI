 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please 
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is (intended to be) the last test release before the JMRI 4.20 production release.
We would really appreciate feedback on it!

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.11.9 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running without errors 
        during startup or on the JMRI log.  
        Once you have JMRI 4.12 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
        you <u>must</u> 
        update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
        carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
        before updating to this release.
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.17.7 or earlier, including if the previous paragraphs
        convinced you to update to JMRI 4.12, 
        we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.18.shtml">JMRI 4.18</a> and make sure that's running without errors 
        during startup or on the JMRI log.
        Once you have JMRI 4.18 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been
        changes panel file format and configuration options since earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.18.shtml">JMRI 4.18</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.18.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.18 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.19 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<ul>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.7.shtml">JMRI 4.19.7</a></span>
    A number of hardware-specific actions now require the system
    connection be associated with them when used as a startup action.
    In many cases, these actions will continue to "just work", but it is
    recommended that actions be verified to be associated with the
    correct connection in the Startup Actions Preferences.</li>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.6.shtml">JMRI 4.19.6</a></span>
    Layout Editor files stored by 4.19.6 may not be loadable 
    by JMRI 4.19.5 and before. This is in addition to the 
    changed in 4.19.5 that raised a similar issue for 4.19.4.
</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.6.shtml">JMRI 4.19.6</a></span>
    A default instance of <code>jmri.jmrit.display.PanelMenu</code> is no
    longer maintained by the InstanceManager for the purposes of maintaining
    a list of open Editors or LayoutEditors. Use the default instance of
    <code>jmri.jmrit.display.EditorManager</code> in scripts instead.
</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.5.shtml">JMRI 4.19.5</a></span>
    Layout Editor files that are stored with version 4.19.5 and later will not 
    generally be readable by versions earlier than 4.19.5.  Version 4.19.5 and later
    continue to be able to read files written by releases
    back to 4.12 and in many cases even older.
</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.4.shtml">JMRI 4.19.4</a></span>
    <code>Manager.getSystemNameArray()</code> has been removed after being 
    deprecated for two years. Please migrate to using
    <code>Manager.getNamedBeanSet()</code> instead.  If you really
    must have an array, use <code>Manager.getNamedBeanSet().toSet()</code>
</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.3.shtml">JMRI 4.19.3</a></span>
    <code>Manager.getSystemNameArray()</code> has been removed after being 
    deprecated for two years. Please migrate to using
    <code>Manager.getNamedBeanSet()</code> instead.  If you really
    must have an array, use <code>Manager.getNamedBeanSet().toArray()</code>;
    see <a href="https://www.techiedelight.com/convert-set-to-array-java/">this tutorial</a> for examples.
</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.3.shtml">JMRI 4.19.3</a></span>
    The JavaCSV API has been replaced with the Apache Commons CSV API.
    This may impact some scripts. See
    <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/jython/TurnoutStatePersistence.py">TurnoutStatePersistence.py</a>
    for an example of how to use the new CSV parsing API. If unable to
    use the new API, the JAR for the old API can be
    <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/sourceforge/javacsv/javacsv/2.0/javacsv-2.0.jar">downloaded</a>
    and added to jmri.conf using the
    <em><a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/StartUpScripts.shtml">--cp:a=path/to/javacsv.jar</a></em>
    parameter.</li>
</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.1.shtml">JMRI 4.19.1</a></span>
        JMRI now enforces the standard form of system names,
        where the system is denoted by a single letter or a letter plus digits.
        Some users of JMRI 4.18 or earlier might have incompatible values.
        If you have one of these hardware connections:
        <ul>
            <li>Anyma DX512 using “DX”
            <li>DCC++ using “DCCPP"
            <li>DCC4PC using “DP"
            <li>JSON client using “json”
            <li>MRC using “MR"
            <li>Marklin CS2 using “MC"
            <li>Raspberry PI using “PI"
            <li>TAMS using “TM”
        </ul>
        you may have to migrate. Please update to JMRI 4.18 prior 
        to installing JMRI 4.19.1 (or later) and check the JMRI Console to
        see if there are any instructions there. See the 
        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">migration page</a>
        for additional information.
    </li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.1.shtml">JMRI 4.19.1</a></span>
        The <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        calls in the various <code>Manager</code> classes
        are no longer needed with Java 8 and have been deprecated for eventual
        removal.  Their replacements are 
        <code>getByUserName</code> and <code>getBySystemName</code> 
        respectively. 
        If you use <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        in script or Java code you've written, please 
        switch to the new names.
    </li>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        JMRI's scripting support now defaults to the UTF-8 character encoding for all
        script files on all platforms. This may require that some scripts be re-saved
        using UTF-8.</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        <strong>Windows Only</strong> The JMRI installer removes the existing
        <em>lib</em> folder from a JMRI installation when upgrading JMRI. The
        existing lib folder contents are retained in the backup folder.
        <strong>This means that any files you have added to the <em>lib</em>
            folder will be removed.</strong></li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        <strong>macOS Only</strong> This version includes changes to how
        the final .dmg file is built, signed and notarized.  This was done to increase
        compatibility with macOS 10.15 Catalina.
        Please drag the JMRI icon to the Applications folder to install this release.
        For more information on 
        <a href="https://jmri.org/install/MacOSX.shtml#catalina">Catalina compatibility</a>,
        see the 
        <a href="https://jmri.org/install/MacOSX.shtml#catalina">JMRI web site</a>.

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.4.shtml">JMRI 4.17.4</a></span>
        Panel file NamedBean items such as Turnouts, Sensors, etc are now written to panel
        files in order by their Manager system prefix and system name.
        Previously, they had (roughly) been written in the order they'd be 
        read from the earlier file(s). This will result in a big change to the order
        the first time a file is re-written, but after that it should be much more stable.</li>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
    		<li>If you have a script that uses the AbstractShutDownTask class, you
    			need to rename the "execute()" routine to "run()", and change the
    			return statement from "return True" to just "return"
