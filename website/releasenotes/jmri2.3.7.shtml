      Release Notes for JMRI 2.3.7 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: Dcember 4, 2008</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.3.7 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the seventh in a series of test versions.

It contains 
many new features, including:
<ul>
<li>Many improvements to the <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/operations/Operations.shtml">Operations</a> code
<li>Improved Windows menu
<li>Updates to the QSI Diesel and CT Elektronik DCX decoder definitions
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.3 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.4" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None)

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

Windows desktop shortcuts have been restructured to make them more reliable.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be effected by this change.

<p>
Starting with the 2.3.4 test release, by default JMRI is allowed to use
up to 200MB of memory (up from a limit of 60MB or 64MB previously).
If this is more memory than you have available, and you notice JMRI
slowing down a lot, please let us know so we can provide a work-around.
<p>
Staring with the 2.3.3 test release, JMRI builds the classpath (the
list of .jar libraries used by the program) dynamically on Windows.  
We'll use this in the future for plug-ins and other features, and
other platforms have been doing this for a while.
If you have added any .jar files to your JMRI program directory, they
may cause problems when the program is starting.  Also, if originally
installed a very old version of JMRI, there might still be files around
that can cause this problems.
If so, you can fix it by moving aside those extra
.jar files from the JMRI program directory, or by asking Windows to un-install JMRI,
before rerunning the installer.
For more information on this, please see this
<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/conversations/topics/35065">discussion</a>
on the JMRi Users group</a>.

<p>JMRI is moving toward requiring Java 1.5 or later.  Certain new features may not work if you are using an earlier
version of Java.  To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts. This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. 
We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts. 
Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and if so a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.3.6:</h3>

David Duchamp fixed a bug that would occasionally cause errors when adding Transits.

<p>
Giorgio Terdina and David Duchamp improved the Window menu.

<p>
Previously, when you opened a locomotive entry in DecoderPro it would use your selected programming mode if it was available in your DCC system and the decoder;
if not, it would select the fastest available mode.
Now, it will always select the fastest available mode, even if you've already selected a workable mode.

<p>
Operations reports now have several selectable levels of detail. Also, train arrival times have been added for switchlists.

<p>
CAN bus connections can now handle extended frames.

<p>
A problem with some of the operations help link was fixed by Dan Boudreau.

<p>
Panel files viewed in web browser now show comments for Turnouts, Sensors, etc; 
some resizing to fit page better; better display of Logix and Simple Signal Logic options.

<p>
"Report Context" now reports screen resolution to help with certain setup problems.

<p>
Fixed a problem loading and storing throttle layouts when not using a standard Java GUI appearance.

<p>
Simple Signal Logic elements now have a comment field, for your convenience in documenting your configuration.

<p>
Initial support for 
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/maple/index.shtml">Maple Systems</a>
control panels is now available.

<p>
Fixed a problem with the panel file DTDs that caused errors for panel files written with JMRI 2.3.3 or later.
This is a read-side error, so earlier JMRI versions will continue to get the error message.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added backup and restore capabilities to operations.

<p>
Dan Boudreau customized the operations code for UK terminology.
To use this, set the language of your computer to "en_GB", or 
use the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/AppConfigPanel.shtml#locale">advanced preferences</a>
to set the language to "English (United Kingdom)".

<p>
Paul Bender updated the XPressNet support for sending raw DCC packets to use the user-provided check byte.
This makes the XPressNet code act like other systems.

<p>
Mike Mosher updated the QSI Diesel version 7 decoder definition.

<p>
Nigel Cliffe updated the CT Elektronik DCX decoder definitions.
