      Release Notes for JMRI 3.9.4 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: October 12, 2014</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.9.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>
<p>RFID support has been changed to allow for additional protocols - existing
   CORE-ID readers <em>should</em> remain unaffected but, in certain
   circumstances, it may be necessary to update connection configuration with 
   the correct protocol.</p>

<p>The activation.jar library is no longer included with the JMRI download.
This shouldn't have any impact on you, but it's remotely possible that it
might impact you if you have your own Java code that you're combining with JMRI
and/or you're still using a Java version before Java 1.6.
(Scripts and panel files will not be impacted.)</p>

<p>Images associated with roster entries are now saved to the roster directory instead of
the resources directory when added to the roster entry. Existing images are not moved.</p>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

The JMRI 3.9.* releases series, including this one, and JMRI 3.10 (expected in December 2014),
will be the last JMRI releases that will work with Java 1.6.  
To use any later JMRI test or production releases, you'll have to 
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or later.
All JMRI releases 3.9.3 and later are tested on Java 1.8, so you 
can do the Java update now if you want to.

<!-- keep this warning in place through the 3.11/3.12 development cycle -->
<p>The XmlIO web service has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in JMRI 3.11 (July 2015).
All users and developers who are relying on direct access to the XmlIO API are
recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle users are recommended to
begin using webThrottle instead, or to plan on investing in devices that can support
webThrottle, <a href="http://withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a> for iOS, or
<a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org">Engine Driver</a> for Android.</p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<p>The support for TCS WOW decoders is still under development.  This version
includes some new code, but the decoder definition is not yet complete.

<h3>Download links:</h3>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.9.3:</h3>

<p>

<h4>System Support</h4>
<ul>
    <li>LocoNet: no longer ignore slot responses that don't immediately follow a slot request.
            Other hardware can insert messages, which were causing lost acquisitions in software throttles. (Steve Todd)</li>
    <li>LocoNet: if no response to slot request, retry, then call failure method if still no response.  
            Handles Slot Max error, for example. (Steve Todd)</li>
    <li>LocoNet: Configure Duplex Group tool now operates correctly in JMRI profiles 
        which have more than one active LocoNet connection. (B. Milhaupt)</li>
    <li>Zimo: Now Supporting the Binary Protocol v5 for the MXULF and tentatively on the MX10 for  (K Dickerson)
        <ul>
            <li>Service Mode Programming</li>
            <li>Track Power Control</li>
            <li>Throttle Control</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>MERG: attempt to resolve the throttle allowing full range of long addresses.
    	It was not correctly processing the long/short option for some address values.
    	(K. Cameron)</li>
</ul>	

<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>

    <p>Added definitions for Qdecoder accessory and function decoders:  F0-4, F0-8, F0-4+, F0-8+, Z1-8N, Z1-16, Z1-16+, Z2-8N, Z2-8, Z2-8+ (Alain Le Marchand)</p>
    <p>Added definitions for Digirails (Digikeijs) DCC LED bar DR80010 (Ronald aka ROn30)</p>
    <p>Alain Carraso added definitions for the Trix Glasscar 22191 and BB12000</p>
    <p>Nigel Cliffe added a definition for the Hornby TTS</p>
    <p>Team Digital provided updates for the CSC and SHD2</p>

<h4>Scripting</h4>
<ul>
	<li>in AbstractAutomaton (used by some scripts), cancel throttle requests after failure or timeout so that 
		subsequent retries can complete (Steve Todd)</li>
	<li>change AutoDispatcher2.py to retry on acquisition failure or timeout (Steve Todd)</li>
	<li>Two new sample scripts for the LocoNet Find operation:
	    <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/LnFindTransponder.py">LnFindTransponder.py</a> and
	    <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/LnFindTransponderField.py">LnFindTransponderField.py</a>.</li>
	<li>Script to use fascia button to release/hold signal (e.g. for automated train) 
	    <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/HoldSignalForSensor.py">HoldSignalForSensor.py</a>(Steve Todd)</li>
	<li>Script to use fascia button to control loco functions (horn, bell, etc.) 
	    <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/ThrottleFunctionForSensor.py">ThrottleFunctionForSensor.py</a>(Steve Todd)</li>
	<li>Script to check the status of C/MRI node polling, e.g. to detect a powered-off node, and
	    set into sensors for display on panels: <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/CmriNodeMonitor.py">CmriNodeMonitor.py</a>
</ul>

   <h4>Operations</h4>
   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You can now select the type of sort you want directly in the car roster print or
     preview window.</li>
    <li>The program now prints out the entire location and track name when printing or
     previewing your car roster. Previously the program limited the number of print characters to
     38.</li>
    <li>The column order for the Cars window is now saved correctly.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem were cars in a kernel weren't correctly redirected from an alternate
     track. Thanks to David Waraxa for finding and reporting this problem.</li>
    <li>Track comments are now saved to the CSV files.</li>
    <li>Some additional improvements to the train build report. A list of cars that couldn't be
     routed is now shown at the end of the report,</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where cars in a kernel in a train departing staging and returning to the
     same staging track could cause the program to incorrectly report track space issues.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Shapes (Control Panel Editor)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Minimal size of a shape changed to 4x4 pixels.</li>
	<li>Error detection improve - shapes no longer disappear on invalid data.</li>
	<li>Both line and fill colors may have transparency - i.e. can be made transparent.</li>
</ul>	
<h4>Warrants</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Help file added to the NXWarrant window. See file for details to the following</li>
	<li>NXWarrant algorithm changed to conform to actual block distances.  It is strongly recommended to enter reasonable lengths of OBlocks.</li>
	<li>Menu item for layout scale added.</li>
</ul>	

   <h4>Web Server and Web Throttles</h4>

    <ul>
    <li>Fixed error introduced in 3.8 that sometimes prevented a Panel from linking to another Panel (Randall Wood)</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Joan de Castro improved the Catalan translation.</li>
    <li>Included the pathname of currently loaded panel file to Context output (Matthew Harris)</li>
    <li>Added the possibility to include both the currently loaded panel file and
        relevant files from active profile when uploading debugging info (Matthew Harris)</li>
