<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is one of the last in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

The JMRI 3.9.* releases series, including this one, and JMRI 3.10 (expected in December 2014),
will be the last JMRI releases that will work with Java 1.6.  
To use any later JMRI test or production releases, you'll have to 
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or later.
All JMRI releases 3.9.3 and are tested on Java 1.8, so you 
can do the Java update now if you want to.

<p>The 3.9.5 release had some changes to XML file processing.  They're meant to be transparent
for existing files (roster, panels, etc), but mistakes happen. If you encounter trouble
with existing roster or panel files, please let us know.  Most importantly, if 
that happens, immediately make a back up copy of your files!

<p>RFID support has been changed to allow for additional protocols - existing
   CORE-ID readers <em>should</em> remain unaffected but, in certain
   circumstances, it may be necessary to update connection configuration with 
   the correct protocol.</p>

<p>The activation.jar library is no longer included with the JMRI download.
This shouldn't have any impact on you, but it's remotely possible that it
might impact you if you have your own Java code that you're combining with JMRI
and/or you're still using a Java version before Java 1.6.
(Scripts and panel files will not be impacted.)</p>

<p>Images associated with roster entries are now saved to the roster directory instead of
the resources directory when added to the roster entry. Existing images are not moved.</p>

<!-- keep this warning in place through the 3.11/3.12 development cycle -->
<p>The XmlIO web service has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed after JMRI 3.12 (July 2015).
All users and developers who are relying on direct access to the XmlIO API are
recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle users are recommended to
begin using webThrottle instead, or to plan on investing in devices that can support
webThrottle, <a href="http://www.withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a> for iOS, or
<a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org">Engine Driver</a> for Android.</p>

<!-- keep this warning in place through the 3.11/3.12 development cycle -->
<p>Several methods in the InstanceManager class have been deprecated and will be removed
after JMRI 3.12 (July 2015). This doesn't affect JMRI users, but if you have your own 
code that uses JMRI, please 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/jmri/java/src/jmri/InstanceManager.java">take a look at the code</a>
and make any necessary changes.

<h3>Changes since test release 3.9.5:</h3>

<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A problem in the QDecoder ZBasic definition was fixed.
        <li>Decoder definitions can now be written for accessory decoders that use
            accessory ops mode programming.  
            See the <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/0NMRA_accessory.xml">xml/decoders/0NMRA_accessory.xml</a> file
            for an example.  This is new support which needs more work and testing. If you
            have one of these decoders and want to help, please contact us.
        <li>Peter Ulvestad fixed some spelling errors in BLI Blueline decoder definitions.
        <li>Fixed a problem with addresses in some older TCS BEMF decoders
    </ul>

<h4>Signaling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Additional icons in the <a href="http://jmri.org/resources/icons/USS/">USS series</a>
        <li>Fixed a problem with the Approach aspect and diverging in the basic signal set
    </ul>

 
<h4>Scripting</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The Python interpreter is now initialized on demand, when first used. If the former
    default behavior of initializing the Python interpreter during application launch is
    required, include -Dorg.jmri.python.preload=true in the JMRI_OPTIONS environment
    variable.</li>
    <li>It is now possible to influence the initialization of the Python interpreter by
    setting Jython and Python properties in the file "python.properties" in a Configuration
    Profile directory, or in the JMRI Settings directory.</li>
    <li>A Jython interpreter must be in the Java CLASSPATH. JMRI is shipped with a Jython
    interpreter, so unless the JMRI installation is modified, one should be available.</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Operations</h4>
   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>New feature. You can now manually select a background color for a train's row in the
     "Trains" window. There's also an "Auto" option that allows you to select a background color for
     when a train is built, build fails, or is terminated. See under Tools in the Trains window
     "Trains Table Colors".</li>
    <li>Removed in manifest and switch list title any references to "manifest" or "switch
     list". Now manifests and switch lists text is completely under the control of a user.</li>
   </ul>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>LocoNet turnouts that use EXACT feedback now transition through INCONSISTENT as 
        they move from THROWN to CLOSED or CLOSED to THROWN.  
    <li>SE8c signal heads now try to track the layout status to detect changes
        in their state caused by external events, e.g. something outside JMRI
        changing them.  This is useful when e.g. you've got two computers controlling
        a LocoNet.  Note that this works for RED, YELLOW, GREEN and DARK, but 
        not for the FLASHING aspects, nor for Held and Lit states.  The recommendation
        is still to have all your layout Logix running in a single running copy
        of JMRI.
    <li>NCE Network Connection method fixed to enable the different NCE menu items. (Ken C)
    <li>RFID support has been added for Seeed Studio RDM630 readers. (Matthew Harris)
    <li>Walter Thompson improved the LocoNet stats help.
    <li>Improved handling of long vs short in AbstractAutomat scripting
    </ul>
