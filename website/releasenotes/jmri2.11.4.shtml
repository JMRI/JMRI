      Release Notes for JMRI 2.11.4 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: April 16, 2011</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.11.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.
 
<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fourth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.12 or 3.0 production release in 2011. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>The release notes are arranged by contributor now. 
    This not only gives credit to the hard work behind each individual contribution, 
    but also helps provide a bit more organization, 
    as each developer tends to have a particular part of the code they focus on

<li>Big news for those who find the standard JMRI font too big or too small. 
    You can now change it via Preferences -&gt; Display

<li>Numerous improvements to Operations

<li>The LocoNet monitor translates additional commands into plain English

<li>Fixes glitches in the CP290 and Insteon Powerline interfaces

<li>Fixes a timing glitch in the RobotThrottle3 script that allowed a train 
    to effectively trip its own signal before it actually passed. 
    With the fix in place, Walt our intrepid moderator has run 
    7 simultaneous trains under RT3 control for 4 hours without interruption

<li>The AutoDispatcher script now sports user defined track colors along with several new schedule commands

<li>Improvements to the JMRI installer allows the Windows Task Manager to properly display the names of the 
    various JMRI applications

<li>Assorted bug fixes and improvements to the Layout, Panel and Control Panel editors

<li>JMRI throttles now feature icons for the throttle and function buttons 
    (you can turn them off if you don't like them)

<li>The 1st pieces of the Aspect Signaling system are coming into place. With this release you can assign speeds in the block and turnout tables. These speeds are also available to the various automation tools such as RobotThrottle3 and AutoDispatcher

<li>Cleared out a couple big bottlenecks in the Mini-Web Server. 
    Web based throttles and panels should should now have a lot more "snap" to them

<li>Various additions and corrections to the decoder files, 
    with an especially large contribution of definitions for the newer Digitrax sound decoders

</ul>
along with other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

Development Version 2.11.4 contains significant improvements to the Powerline Interfaces. 
Some of these improvements involved a complete restructuring of the underlying code. 
As a result, previously working Preferences may now show no connections for some of the Powerline Interfaces. 
If this occurs, go to Preferences and setup the Powerline Layout Connections again. 
Then save the Preferences and restart JMRI.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

In Development Version 2.11.3 JMRI instituted a more robust and transparent system for handling missing panel icon files. 
If missing icon files are discovered during the panel loading process 
this system presents a dialog box that allows the user to either delete the offending reference 
or use the file browser to find the proper location. 
Older versions of JMRI didn't always fully remove the references to deleted panel icons. 
Panels which contain these stray references will present the dialog box during the first panel load. 
If the panel worked fine before, simply choose the delete option for each "missing" icon presented 
to remove the stray references. Once the panel has finished loading, save/store the panel file, quit JMRI and then reload. As a precaution, we recommend either making a backup copy of your panel file before diving in or saving the modified file under a different name

<p>
There have been extensive changes to the throttle code.
If you have written scripts that use throttles, particularly
multiple throttles, please check to make sure they still work.

<p>
The numerical values of "ON" and "OFF" for Lights changed in JMRI 2.11.2, 
along with some of the other constants in the class.  
This will have no impact on people just using the program.  
If you're using scripts with numerical values
in them, please recode them to use the symbolic values.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since production version 2.11.3</h3>

<p>
<p>Dan Boudreau:
<ul>
<li>Users can now adjust font size.  See Edit Preferences, Display GUI.</li>
</ul>

New operations features and bug fixes:
<ul>
	<li>Cars with a final destination will no longer wander if the
	destination track doesn't have space for the car.</li>
	<li>The edit schedule destination track menu now shows only valid
	tracks. Staging tracks are no longer shown in the edit schedule window.</li>
	<li>The program will now check the entire schedule in match mode
	when generating custom loads from staging.</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor bug with switch lists, the location status
	wouldn't become "Changed" when there were only car pick ups.</li>
	<li>The switch list "Print Switch List Changes" now only shows new
	trains since the last printing.</li>
	<li>New "Set Cars" tool. Now you can set the location,
	destinations, and load for a group of cars.</li>
	<li>You can also decide to not modify the car's load status when
	using the Set Cars Tool.</li>
	<li>New car sort in the cars window, by car's final destination.</li>	
	<li>New build option, you can now optionally select the departure
	track from staging.</li>
	<li>New operations feature. You can now optionally create a Comma
	Separated Values (csv) manifest file. Now you can use Excel to create a
	custom manifest to your liking. Files can be found in
	operations-&gt;csvManifests</li>
	<li>A new capacity check has been added to limit overloading of a
	siding with a schedule in aggressive mode. Overloading a siding can
	still happen when using aggressive mode, but the overloading is now
	limited.</li>
	<li>Bug fix. A car in a kernel with FRED must be the lead (*) car.
	When editing car with FRED and in kernel, the program will
	automatically make the car the lead.</li>
	<li>Manifests and switch lists now block
	cars by kernel. The new blocking order is: first by road, then number,
	kernel, location and finally destination.  This should keep cars in a
	kernel together on the manifest and switch lists.</li>
	<li>You can now change the loco and car manifest and switch list pick up
	and set out prefixes, i.e. " [ ] Pick up".  See Setting-&gt;Tools Print Options.</li>
	<li>Users can now reset a train directly from the Trains window.</li>
	<li>You can now have operations windows close on save.  See Settings Options.</li>
