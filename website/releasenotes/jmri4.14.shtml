      Release Notes for JMRI 4.14 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: December 23, 2018</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Production Release 4.14 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 4.13 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 4.14" available for download today.</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.9.6 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running OK before
        updating to this release release.  There have been a number of 
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    you <u>must</u> 
    update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to this release.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.15.1.shtml">JMRI 4.15.1</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this production release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>This release changes how "Internal" Throttles, Consisting, CV Programmers and Command Station
        references are configured.  This is done to avoid <u>accidentally</u> getting
        one of these configured as a default instead of using your attached hardware device
        (the dreaded "programmer always reads 123" condition). 
        Most JMRI users will not have to do anything.
        If you do need to use 
        an internal version of these, please go to preferences and add an internal "None"
        connection in addition to the ones you already have, then set defaults.  
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.12 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.13 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p>When running JMRI using Java 9 or Java 10,
    the script import statements need to be fully-qualified:
    in addition to 'import java', you might need 'import java.beans'
    and others. 

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.8.shtml">JMRI 4.11.8</a></span>
    Some new display capabilities were introduced into Layout Editor
    during JMRI 4.11-series development.   
    This release changes some of the defaults in this area, which might 
    change the appearance of some track segments on your panels if they're 
    still using default values. If you select them and change their properties,
    then save your panel file(s), you can restore their previous appearance.
    There's a 
    <a href="../community/LayoutEditorTrackChanges.pdf">PDF document</a>
    with more details.
    We apologize for the inconvenience.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.8.shtml">JMRI 4.11.8</a></span>
    Because of changes to the "node identification" algorithm used to tell 
    one computer running JMRI from another, you might receive a warning message
    about the "Node Identity" the first time you run JMRI version 4.11.8 or newer. (If you 
    have more than one profile, this can happen with each).  There's no permanent
    problem here, but you might have to reset your window preferences (i.e. position
    and size, column layout, etc) in this case.
    We apologize for the inconvenience.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    If you are running a local web site with a copy of the JMRI content, as
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml#local">described here</a>,
    please repeat 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml#locallink">the "setSymLinks.sh" step</a>
    near the bottom of those instructions
    after installing JMRI 4.11.4 (or later).  This will make some new formatting available
    on your local site.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li><br>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li><br>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li><br>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li><br>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li><br>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.2.shtml">JMRI 4.11.2</a></span>
    The system connection preferences (i.e. hardware preferences) are now
    enforcing the <a href="jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">correct form</a>
    for system prefixes:  One upper case letter, 
    optionally followed by a number (one or more digits, e.g. "L12").
    Existing prefixes in existing configurations are unchanged, but
    new ones will have to have the correct form.

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>DCC++</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Costin Grigoras updated the DCC++ support
                    to periodically refresh the function values.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed scrolling in the LocoNet configuration tool panels</li>
                <li>Added the ability to see and select the DCC track signal "Idle" state within the Power Control tool.  
                This enables JMRI users to know when the Digitrax command station has placed the track signal into the "Idle" state, 
                and enables JMRI users to select that "Idle" state.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MERG CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There was work done on MERG consisting</li>
                <li>The MERG CBUS help screens where improved</li>
                <li>Improved MERG Event Capture</li>
                <li>Steve Young made a number of updates to the

                    </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Documentation improved</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>NCE</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added auto-refresh to the Show Cabs tool<li>
                <li>Fixed NCE Edit Macro</li>

                <li>Fixed NCE Edit Consist</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Jeff Collell added Light support</li>
                <li>A Signal Mast directly using OpenLCB Events for the
                individual aspects can now be created using the UI of the
                Signal Masts table.</li>
                <li>There is a new dialog for configuring parameters of various
                OpenLCB protocols, reachable from the Preferences
                dialog->Connection, selecting the appropriate OpenLCB
                connection and clicking the button "Protocol settings".</li>
                <li>The JMRI computer can now have it's node identity (Node ID,
                user name, user description) configurable in the Protocol
                Settings dialog. This will make the JMRI computer(s) attached
                to the layout appear in the Configure Nodes tree with their
                appropriate descriptions.</li>
                <li>Added support for Fast Clock using the Broadcast Time
                Protocol draft. Enable it either in Clock Master or Clock Slave
                mode in the Protocol Settings dialog. Each layout must have
                exactly one generator. Not all features of the standard are
                supported yet. Both Master and Slave mode allows setting the
                time & rate in PanelPro main window -> Tools -> Clocks -> Setup
                Fast Clock menu. For clock slave JMRIs it is advisable to set
                in the Start Up options "Start with fast clock:" to "Don't
                change" and untick the "Set Fast Clock Time" and "Set Clock
                Rate" check boxes to avoid restarting JMRI from re-setting your
                clock master.</li>
                <li>The Connection name for an OpenLCB connection can now be
                changed in the connection preferences dialog. This allows
                renaming it to "LCC" if a user prefers that name.</li>
                <li>In the connection preferences dialog the manufacturer list
                now contains "LCC" as an alias to OpenLCB. There are no
                differences between choosing one or the other, just the
                label.</li>
                <li>Internal bugfixes will make some rarely seen Java errors go
                away. The sequencing of loopback operations will be more
                deterministic, but Logix that were set up in a race condition
                might behave differently due to the sequential execution. A
                typical example that might change would be having a Sensor and
                a Turnout object both be set to the same pair of event IDs,
                then having a Logix change the sensor, and another Logix have
                both that Sensor and that Turnout be in the antecedents but the
                Turnout be non-triggering. The behavior of this setup used to
                be non-deterministic in multi-processor computers.</li>
                <li>The CAN Send Frame can now accept dotted-hex format Event
                IDs.</li>
                <li>The Firmware Upgrade dialog shows the Node list in sorted
                order, also displaying User names and Descriptions for easier
                selection of which node to upgrade.</li>
                <li>Firmware upgrade via the Stream protocol draft is now
                operational (at the time of this writing no commercial hardware
                is available that uses this variant). The protocol to use is
                auto-detected.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>RFID</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Changed the baud rate to 2400 for Parallax readers. Fixes <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/6026">issue 6026</a>.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Roco z21/Z21</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Much technical work was done on this to improve operation</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The decoder definition file structure was updated with a new "defaultItem" element.</li>
     </ul>

        <h4>Hornby</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Brian Jackson updated the TTS definition</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Mistral Train Models</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>Alain Carasso added a definition for the XR Trailer decoder</li>
             </ul>

        <h4>RR-CirKits</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Dick Bronson updated the MotorMan2 decoder definition</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SoundTraxx</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Michael Mosher added an SD60 definition</li>
                <li>Michael Mosher added definitions for several models</li>                
            </ul>

        <h4>TCS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Mike Mosher updated the WOW Steam V4 and various non-sound decoders</li>
            </ul>
	    
	    <h4>Team Digital</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Definitions for several Team Digital devices have been updated 
                to indicate that they use Programming-on-the-Main mode even when
                they are only connected to the LocoNet.  </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Uhlenbrock</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>New decoder definitions were added for:
                <ul>
                    <li>the IntelliSound4 Module 325x</li>
                    <li>the IntelliSound3 multi-protocol decoders 363x</li>
                    <li>the IntelliSound4 multi-protocol decoders 365x</li>
                </ul>
                The programmer for these mobile decoders shows an additional IntelliSound tab for configuration of the
                embedded and SUSI connected modules.<br>
                The advanced sound functions are grouped logically, so select a SUSI range, than a Bank (or <i>Normal</i>
                to disable sound programming). The CVs follow the full manufacturer's documentation. Test feedback is
                appreciated, especially on the associated software version numbers (read from CV7).</li>
                <li>Behind the scenes, common xml code has been combined in one place to ease work on translations.</li>
            </ul>

        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"/>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="since">since 4.13.4</span>
                Starting with this release, JMRI will create new profile directories with the
                suffix ".jmri".  This allows them to be more properly accessed in macOS/iOS 
                eco-system (we do it on all platforms for people who share profiles between
                different types of computers). It also allows people to rename their
                profiles (outside of JMRI, i.e. through their computer's file browser)
                with a .jmri ending. 
                For more background, please see 
                <a  href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/5777">PR 5777</a>.
                </li>
            <li>This release contains a significant update to how defaults are 
                handled for the various system components like programming tools, throttle tools, etc.
                Previously, the "internal" versions of those were often selected as defaults,
                causing some confusion.  Now, unless you have explicitly created an internal connection
                by adding it on the connections page, they won't be, and hardware-specific connections
                will be used instead.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>New Layout Scale process</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A default scale set is distributed with JMRI as an XML file rather than hardcoded lists.</li>
            <li>A jmri.Scale instance is a constrained bean:
              <ul>
                <li>The user name defaults to the scale name and can be changed.
                    The toString() method uses the user name and scale ratio, e.g. N (160).</li>
                <li>The scale ratio can be changed.</li>
                <li>The scale factor is automatically calculated from the scale ratio.</li>
                <li>Vetoable listeners can be notified of changes and can prevent changes
                    that might impact application stability.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>jmri.ScaleManager manages access to the Scale instances.</li>
            <li>A "CUSTOM" scale entry is included which an application can implement if desired.</li>
            <li>Any changes result in the default list being copied to the user file location.
                This makes it possible for users to create their own scale list.
                The distributed list is not used if the user file location list is present.</li>
          </ul>
