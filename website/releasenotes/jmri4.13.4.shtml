      Release Notes for JMRI 4.13.4 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: October 22, 2018</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.13.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2018.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.9.6 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running OK before
        updating to this test release.  There have been a number of 
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    you <u>must</u> 
    update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to this release.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.11.3.shtml">JMRI 4.11.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
            <li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.10.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.10 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.11 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.8.shtml">JMRI 4.11.8</a></span>
    Some new display capabilities were introduced into Layout Editor
    during JMRI 4.11-series development.   
    This release changes some of the defaults in this area, which might 
    change the appearance of some track segments on your panels if they're 
    still using default values. If you select them and change their properties,
    then save your panel file(s), you can restore their previous appearance.
    There's a 
    <a href="../community/LayoutEditorTrackChanges.pdf">PDF document</a>
    with more details.
    We apologize for the inconvenience.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.8.shtml">JMRI 4.11.8</a></span>
    Because of changes to the "node identification" algorithm used to tell 
    one computer running JMRI from another, you might receive a warning message
    about the "Node Identity" the first time you run JMRI version 4.11.8 or newer. (If you 
    have more than one profile, this can happen with each).  There's no permanent
    problem here, but you might have to reset your window preferences (i.e. position
    and size, column layout, etc) in this case.
    We apologize for the inconvenience.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    If you are running a local web site with a copy of the JMRI content, as
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml#local">described here</a>,
    please repeat 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml#locallink">the "setSymLinks.sh" step</a>
    near the bottom of those instructions
    after installing JMRI 4.11.4 (or later).  This will make some new formatting available
    on your local site.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.2.shtml">JMRI 4.11.2</a></span>
    The system connection preferences (i.e. hardware preferences) are now
    enforcing the <a href="jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">correct form</a>
    for system prefixes:  One upper case letter, 
    optionally followed by a number (one or more digits, e.g. "L12").
    Existing prefixes in existing configurations are unchanged, but
    new ones will have to have the correct form.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.6.shtml">JMRI 4.7.6</a></span>
    If you're having trouble getting your DCC programmer to work, try
    checking that the settings on the Defaults pane under Preferences window point to your
    hardware system.
    The reason: This version of JMRI (and all later) provides more options for
    picking the default system when you have more than one set of hardware attached
    The default is then used for throttles, for programming, etc.  JMRI tries to 
    guess the right settings for these when you upgrade to this version, but 
    apparently it sometimes gets that wrong (we haven't been able to track
    that down yet). Setting them manually fixes any wrong guesses.

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri4.13.3.shtml">Test release 4.13.3</a>:</h2>
<!-- <h2>Changes since <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">Production release 4.12</a>:</h2> -->

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aclosed&q=milestone%3A4.13.4">list of included commits</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added the ability to see and select the DCC track signal "Idle" state within the Power Control tool.  
                This enables JMRI users to know when the Digitrax command station has placed the track signal into the "Idle" state, 
                and enables JMRI users to select that "Idle" state.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Jeff Collell added Light support</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>RFID</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Changed the baud rate to 2400 for Parallax readers. Fixes <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/6026">issue 6026</a>.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>

	    <h4>Team Digital</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Definitions for several Team Digital devices have been updated 
                to indicate that they use Programming-on-the-Main mode even when
                they are only connected to the LocoNet.  </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Uhlenbrock</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New decoder definitions were added for:
            <ul>
                <li>the IntelliSound4 Module 325x</li>
                <li>the IntelliSound3 multi-protocol decoders 363x</li>
                <li>the IntelliSound4 multi-protocol decoders 365x</li>
            </ul>
            The programmer for these mobile decoders shows an additional IntelliSound tab for configuration of the
            embedded and SUSI connected modules.<br>
            The advanced sound functions are grouped logically, so select a SUSI range, than a Bank (or <i>Normal</i>
            to disable sound programming). The CVs follow the full manufacturer's documentation. Test feedback is
            appreciated, especially on the associated software version numbers (read from CV7).</li>
            <li>Behind the scenes, common xml code has been combined in one place to ease work on translations.</li>
        </ul>



   <h3>Switchboard Editor</h3>
        <a id="SW" name="SW"/>
        <ul>
            <li>A new "Auto Range" option allows you to release the fixed range of items and fill in any start and end
            address between 1 and 10,000. When a range over 250 is entered, a confirmation dialog pops up.<br>
            The actual range limit is 400 items, unless the <i>Hide unconnected items"</i> box is checked.</li>
            <li>The spinner to set the number of items was renamed <i>Number of Rows</i>.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"/>
        <ul>
            <li>When running JMRI using Java 9 or Java 10,
                the script import statements need to be fully-qualified:
                in addition to 'import java', you might need 'import java.beans'
                and others. These have been added to the sample scripts.
                (Although we might have missed a few...)
            </li>
            <li>JerryG improved some sample script documentation</li>
        </ul>            

    <h3>Timetable</h3>
        <a id="Timetable" name="Timetable"/>
        <span class="since">since 4.13.4</span>
        <ul>
            <li>The Timetable tool uses layout and train information to create train graphs.  
	        See <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/TimeTable.shtml">Timetable Help</a> for details.</li>
        </ul>
	
   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Karl Johan Lisby updated SCWarrants
                so they don't automatically turn off functions at end of run.
                This lets you keep them on if e.g. you're starting another warrant.
                </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting with this release, JMRI will create new profile directories with the
                suffix ".jmri".  This allows them to be more properly accessed in macOS/iOS 
                eco-system (we do it on all platforms for people who share profiles between
                different types of computers). It also allows people to rename their
                profiles (outside of JMRI, i.e. through their computer's file browser)
                with a .jmri ending. 
                For more background, please see 
                <a  href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/5777">PR 5777</a>.
