	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2012</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.1.8 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

This release created in SVN and built via Jenkins, but was never 
released to the public. Instead, we went straight to 
production release 3.2.  This page remains as a record of that.

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

None

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6.

<p>
To allow use of UTF-8 characters (special characters with accents, Japanese text, etc) in XML
files, particularly decoder definitions, the default file encoding has been changed to UTF-8.
This requires a change to the startup scripts distributed with JMRI.
If you're just using the JMRI-provided startup tools, you should be all set.
This was done in JMRI 3.1.6, so if you installed that, you're OK now.
If you're using your own custom startup scripts, 
you need to add a "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" option to them. 
If you have any problems with special characters in your existing files, 
please let us know as soon as possible.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None.
