<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.4 production release at mid-year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>For users of JMRI on Microsoft Windows, the installer will now request
Administrator permissions if the user running the installation is not a member
of the administrators group. Users of Windows Vista or later may receive a
UAC (User Account Control) pop-up message when installing.</p>

<p>The TCS decoder definitions have been extensively reworked.  
You'll notice that they list different families and the models are 
organized differently.  This is to make the automatic identification 
work much better.  Please let us know if you encounter any problems with this.

<p>This release and all future releases will not support the NCE serial interface running at 19,200 baud.</p>

<p>The decoder definition files have been extensively reworked for this release series
to reduce their size and allow  them to be translated to other languages.
Please keep an eye out for any inadvertent changes to the definitions 
that might have been introduced.</p>

<p>This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6 or later.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.
