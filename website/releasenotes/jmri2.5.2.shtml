      Release Notes for JMRI 2.5.2 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: March 27, 2009</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.5.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the second in a series of test versions.

It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
	<li>The new DecoderPro manual (in the program help pages)
	<li>Many new and improved decoder definitions for DecoderPro
	<li>Improved startup and <a href="/install/WindowsNew.shtml">install procedures</a> on Windows
	<li>Improvements to Logix, Routes and other tools
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

The Logix support in this JMRI version has a lot of
new capabilities, but panel files that use these capabilities
can't be read by previous versions of the program. 
Please keep backup copies of your panel files in case you
want to move back to a previous version.

<p>
There have been extensive changes to the way JMRI installs and starts on Windows.
(See the <a href="/install/WindowsNew.shtml">updated installation documentation</a> for details).
If you have custom shortcuts, you may have to revisit them.

<p>
The downloads are significantly larger due to more text and images
in the help pages, especially the updated manual.

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

<p>JMRI now requires Java 1.5 or later.
If you are using an older version of Java, please
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">upgrade your Java installation</a>.  
To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>
The way you drag things in the Layout Editor has changed if you
are using a Linux computer. 

<p>
Windows desktop shortcuts have been restructured to make them more reliable.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be affected by this change.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.5.1:</h3>

Fixed some links within help pages.

<p>
Xavier Chazelle provided a new decoder definition for the Uhlenbrock 73400 mini decoder.

<p>
New NMRA manufacturer numbers:
<ul>
    <li>49 - Joka Electronic
    <li>50 - N&amp;Q Electronics
    <li>51 - DCC Supplies, Ltd
</ul>

<p>
Matt Harris improved the Windows startup scripts to 
put the messages.log log file and the Jython cache files
in the JMRI preferences directory. 
This lets JMRI run cleanly on Windows 7.

<p>
Nigel Cliffe and Mark Waters provided new definitions for the
Zimo MX620 decoder.

<p>Dan Boudreau made several enhancements to the operations program.
You can now specify car loads, and define the name of the load received
or shipped for a siding by using the schedule feature. Schedules can now
be accessed from the Locations menu under Tools. You can now also modify
the default load names for empty and loaded. Edit frames now appear on
top when launched from tables. He also fixed a print problem when a car
with a FRED was printed in a switch list or manifest. Trains, Train, and
Route windows now have print and preview tools. Also fixed a problem
where some buttons were not visible on some operations windows.

<p>
Matt Harris fixed a problem launching JMRI on a Windows 64-bit machine with
more than 2GB of memory installed.

<p>
Ken Cameron fixed a problem saving the Powerline CP290 configuration.

<p>
The Linux startup scripts should now have executable permission set automatically.

<p>
Bob Coleman added Acela Signalhead support.  
Double and Triple will now work, 
but they send individual on and off commands rather 
than more optimal Acela signal commands down to the hardware.
So, added an Acela Aspect option that will do things efficiently 
for Acela and also correctly supports BiPolar and Wigwags.

<p>
Matt Harris made the startup scripts more reliable on Windows 98.

<p>
John Plocher updated the instructions for using Eclipse to build JMRI.

<p>
Andrew Crosland improved the CBUS and CAN utility tools.

<p>
David Duchamp added automatic setting of turnouts to Dispatcher

<p>

<p>
Matt Harris added a decoder definition for versions 41 to 43 of the 
Lenz LE103XF.

<p>

with information from Bob Grosh.

<p>
Jeff Schmaltz updated the Massoth decoder definitions.

<p>
Jeff Schmaltz added additional detail to the Zimo MX69 and MX690 definitions.

<p>
Jeff Schmaltz updated the version numbers for several ESU decoders.

<p>
Mark Waters fixed CV38 in the Zimo MX620 series of decoder definitions,
updated the more recent versions to include additional CVs,
and created a new definition for the MX620 decoder version 9.12.

provides a table of active NCE cabs addresses, loco speed, and function keys.

<p>
Matt Harris has created a new, much more professional Windows installer.

<p>
Bob Jacobsen updated the RPS support to handle large number of points better.

<p>
David Duchamp added a continuous running option to Dispatcher.

<p>
Fixed a problem with the function mapping in DecoderPro when a decoder
has a large number of functions and outputs, which was causing trouble 
for the MRC Sound Brilliance 1644 decoder.

<p>
Pete Cressman and David Parks fixed a problem with a tiny active 
area for MultiSensors when the default inactive, etc, icons are still used.

<p>
Ken Cameron added methods so you can enable and disable polling of 
C/MRI, etc, nodes via scripts.

<p>
Peter Cressman provided a large update to Logix. In particular, the 
Conditionals in the Logix can now compute more complicated logical
expressions; more than two actions can be attached to a conditional;
the user interface is more flexible; and certain internal race conditions
that resulted in inconsistent results have been fixed.

<p>
Richard Sauerbrun provided info for the TCS 1278 decoder model.

<p>
David Duchamp added a 3-way turnout tool and other additions to Layout Editor tools

<p>
Simon Ginsburg updated the German, Czech and Spanish translations.

<p>
Ken Cameron provided an example script for turning CMRI node polling on and off.

<p>
Fixed a bug in C/MRI error handling that would cause the wrong node to be reset
if several polls were missed.  (This only affected C/MRI, not other hardware types)

<p>

and greatly improved the previous PM4Announce.py script.

<p>
Lou DeHayes provided a definition for the MRC Sound Brilliance 1806 decoder.

<p>
Pete Cressman improved the user interface for defining Sensor Groups. 
Also, Sensor Groups can now be migrated to become a Logix conditional 
by viewing the group and then pressing the 'make group' button.
(This deletes the group as a series of routes and implements it as a Logix Conditional.  
This is a special type of Conditional for radio button type action 
and cannot be edited as a Conditional.) 
A Panel for the names of existing groups is added to the Sensor Group window.  
Editing of Sensor Groups is done from Sensor Group window - view the group, make changes, 
press make group.

<p>
Pete Cressman removed the limitation on the number of turnouts or sensors that
can be set in a route.

<p>
Pete Cressman made it possible to export Routes to Logix conditionals - 
there, additional attributes can be added to the triggering controls or 
outputs by ordinary conditional editing.  
Pressing 'Add Route' still creates a traditional route in the Route Table.  
Existing Routes can be migrated to their equivalent implementation as Logix 
Conditionals by pressing the 'Export to Logix' button on the Route Editing window.

<p>
Marc Fornier added the K1D4 decoder to the TCS definitions.

<p>
Jim Betz added the Z2 TCS decoder

<p>
