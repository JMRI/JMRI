    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test version 4.5.8 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the perhaps the last in a series of test versions that will 
end in the next JMRI production release in December 2016.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
We would very much appreciate testing and feedback, so we can catch bugs before the production release.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>

<!--
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.5.9.shtml">JMRI 4.5.9</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>None yet</a>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.4.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.4 release note</a> for warnings predating the 4.4 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.6)</em> 
    When a Digitrax DCS240 is the command station, JMRI throttles may not be able to take control 
    of a locomotive or consist in some cases if the DCS240 "expanded slots" (i.e. 400 slots) feature is in use. 
    Be sure to "dispatch" or "release" locomotives and consists from throttles which use "expanded 
    slots" before attempting to acquire the locomotive or consist via a JMRI throttle, as this may 
    enable JMRI to acquire the locomotive or consist.  This problem can affect throttles which 
    use the JMRI WiThrottle interface and throttles controlled via the JMRI Web Server.  This issue
    is thought to be present in all previous versions of JMRI.
    
<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.6)</em> 
   DCC++ connections on Linux may not work.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.6)</em> 
        As part of fixing the 
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/2081">TMCC throttle issue</a>,
        the handling of TMCC preferences was changed.  If you have a TMCC
        connection configured, please go to the 
        "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Connection">Defaults</a>"
        pane in the Preferences window and make sure that the 
        TMCC connection is selected for the appropriate device types.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.5)</em> 
        Apple has released a new "Sierra" version of macOS (formerly known as OS X) which has
        enhanced security for downloaded programs.  We're providing a new form of signed download
        to work with this, see below.  We'd be interested to hear whether that download
        works on older OS versions, so that we can just release this new form
        without having to provide separate downloads.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.2)</em>
    This and future versions of JMRI may not function on OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. OS X
    operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
    user's group.
    <p>To remove Java SE 6 from OS X, follow these steps (these steps assume
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>, if not,
      adjust the following paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command <code>/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh</code> It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
          It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
        </li>
      <li><em>El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  
<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.2)</em>
    Support for directly executing AppleScript within JMRI has been removed
    due to changes in macOS and Java outside our control. If you require the
    ability to use AppleScript, you may be able to add this capability on your
    own by visiting <a href="https://jmri.github.io/applescript">JMRI
      AppleScript Support</a>, but please be aware that this may not work
    on upcoming releases of macOS or Java.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.1)</em>
    LocoTools, no longer supported since JMRI 2.10, has been removed from the Linux and OS X distributions.</li>

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.1)</em>
    Internal turnouts and sensors need to have complete, individual system names.
    The names "IT" and "IS" (without any suffix) are no longer permitted:
    "IT12" is fine, but just "IT" is not. Most panel files that contain these should
    automatically migrate them to new names when saved, but in some cases you might need to manually update them.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.3.5)</em>
    When sharing a configuration between this version and JMRI 4.3.4 or older, the older version of JMRI will not
    reflect changes in preferences, window position, table sorting, column order, or other user interface state. This is due to
    changes in how user preferences and interface state are stored.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.3.3)</em>
    You can now set the order of your startup items: If you're opening panel files, running scripts, etc as
    the program starts up, there's a preferences pane that lets you easily set the order in which those happen.
    If you've set the order manually (e.g. by editing configuration files) in the past, please check this
    preference to make sure it's set the way you want.</p>

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.1.2)</em>
    Jython has been upgraded to version 2.7.0 with the following potentially breaking changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The decodeJmriFilename() function is no longer available by default. Use the  FileUtil.getExternalFilename() method instead.</li>
      <li>The simple propertyListener object is no longer available by default. Create your own, following the examples provided in the jython folder in the JMRI distribution.</li>
      <li>jmri_defaults.py included in the JMRI distribution is no longer executed by default, but will be executed before any other Jython scipts if included in your User Files location.</li>
      <li>The default behavior of python.cachedir.skip is now true. If using a custom python.properties file, include "python.cachedir.skip=false" in that file.</li>
      <li>Certain Python scripts are too large to be evaluated in Jython. If a script fails with the <code>java.io.IOException: Mark invalid</code> error, set "jython.exec=true" in a custom python.properties file or rewrite the script to be less than 100,000 characters per file. Note that when using "jython.exec=true" it may be desirable to run the included script jmri_bindings.py as a startup action to emulate the evaluation environment used when jython.exec=false.</li>
    </ul>

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.1.1)</em>
    Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  Definitions
    included with this release have been converted to the new form.
    If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
    validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
    Please ask on the JMRI Users group
    for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.</p>
