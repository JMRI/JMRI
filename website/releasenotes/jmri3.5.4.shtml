<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.6 production release around the end of the year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.5.3:</h3>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Trains can now make local moves at the last location in a train's route. You can
     disable this feature by not allowing pickups at the last location in the train's route.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem where the program would redirect cars from the alternate track for a
     train that didn't have access to the spur that specified the alternate track. Thanks to Joe
     Mattick for bring this to our attention.</li>
    <li>Fixed a couple of minor issues when building trains that had restrictions with regards
     to local moves and cars traveling from origin to terminal.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Oscar Moutinho added a new webThrottle app, based on JSON and web sockets</p>

   <p>Steve Todd updated the web version of the Operations Manifest to work properly for in-route trains, and rearranged 
   and added some items to the JMRI Web Server local home page.</p>
   
   <p>Matthew Harris updated the MS Windows launcher to check for an already running
   instance of a JMRI application and to provide an option to continue or abort.
   </p>

    <p>Fixed problem where black-on-black panel icons would not display properly.

    <P>Robin Becker improved the TAM quad decoder definition
    
    <p>Dave Heap improved the DecoderPro operation: Sheet Read and Write operations were ignoring readOnly and writeOnly attributes if the CV value was Unknown.
    The readOnly and writeOnly attributes are now always respected for all Sheet operations. 
    Read Changes will still attempt to read Unknown values but Write Changes will not attempt to write Unknown values.
    
    <p>Dave Heap added extra CVs, panes, workarounds for programmer issues and numerous fixes/improvements for ESU V4 files.
    
    <p>Alain Carasso improved the Mistral Gold decoder definition with "Other Sound Setting" (CV62)
    
    <p>Dave Heap improved the TCS WOW decoder definition.
    
    <p>Steve Lowens improved the Tsunami Rapido F9A definition.
    
    <p>Jeff Schmaltz added a decoder definition for the SoundTrax Piko decoder
    
    <p>Dispatcher - Added an AutoTerminate Option when creating new Trains - KD
    <p>Layout Editor - Fix an NPE error when bring up a popup on a Turntable Ray - KD
    <p>Layout Editor - Fix a bug with the linked connection point - KD
