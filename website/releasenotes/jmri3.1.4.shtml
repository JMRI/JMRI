      Release Notes for JMRI 3.1.4 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: October 15, 2012</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.1.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.2 production release.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.1.3</h3>

<p>Steve Todd made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>fixed issue with xmlio server which was preventing multiple clients from getting updates.</li>
    <li>added layoutblocks to /panel servlet</li>
    <li>added signalhead list and monitoring to /xmlio servlet</li>
    <li>multiple enhancements to showPanel.js, now handles majority of panel widgets</li>
    <li>corrected outdated help regarding JMRI Web Server and added details of new and modified components.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bob Bucklew contributed a set of six wider lever icons that use the same graphic but are placed on a wider transparent background. 
These are easier to use with touch panels, but also work well with mouse or trackball clicks. 
The larger target is especially useful when used with a 3 position multi sensor icon.
They are available in the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/resources/icons/USS/plate/levers/">/resources/icons/USS/plate/levers/</a> directory.

<p>Robin Becker contributed a set of code buttons to match Bob Bucklew's wider lever icons.</p>
<P>Robin Becker fixed a nasty, long-standing problem with how various complicated variable definitions in DecoderPro
interacted.  This could, under the right circumstances, cause reading or writing of the decoder to hang permanently.

<p>Kevin Dickerson made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Roster - Fix an issue that corrupted the roster index if the roster was saved while a newly created unsaved roster entry was open.</li>
    <li>Tables - Fixed a potential error that could occur when loading a panel file if the turnout table was already open.<li>
    <li>Entry Exit (NX) - Added the option to set the action when the NX sensors are selected a second time.</li>
    <li>Layout Editor - Fixed an issue with te SSL Logic for a slip icon that resulted in a diverging route not being set for limited speed correctly.</li>
    <li>Sections - Add Directional Sensors to SSL, now covers SSL used on Single and Double Slips.</li>
    <li>Abstract Automation - Assign the name to the thread to help identify any issues caused by the thread</li>
    <li>Dispatcher - Fix a couple of Index Out Of Bounds Exceptions</li>
    <li>Dispatcher - Fix an issue where a loco set to a paused state would never restart</li>
    <li>ZTC - Fixed an issue that prevent a connection being made</li>
    <li>ECOS - Update some of the back end code relating to the Ecos loco database</li>
    <li>ECOS - Update throttle code to allow 14/28/128 speed steps</li>
</ul>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>When building a train, the move list is no longer in alphabetical order.</li>
    <li>You can now force a car or locomotive to any track when using the "Set" window.</li>
    <li>You can now reset the move counts for cars and locos. See under Tools-&gt;Roster in the
     Cars and Locomotives window.</li>
    <li>Train, car, and locomotive log files are now only created when there's data to save.
     This should eliminate empty log files.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where all cars in a kernel were being checked when selecting a track from
     staging. Only the lead car in the kernel should have been checked.</li>
    <li>The train log now includes the build failure messages</li>
    <li>You can now have your manifest show the departure time rather than the estimated
     arrival time. See Print Options for more information</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Ken Cameron made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>NCE Cab Monitor - Converted to using table format for the cab detail display</li>
</ul>

<p>Pete Cressman made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to draw shapes (rectangles, circles etc) in ControlPanelEditor.  <b>Note:</b> Use Shift key to select for dragging or popup
(expected usage is to overlay panel items).</li>
<li>Added let Warrants run automated trains without them occupying the starting block - thus warrants can be chained dynamically.</li>
</ul>

<P>
The OpenLCB support now has a built-in hub for Internet access to your OpenLCB. Start the hub
from the OpenLCB menu or a startup item, the connect your iPhone via port 12021.
<p>
The issue that prevented NCE Power Pro Systems from being used for programming has now been fixed.

<p>
Dave Heap improved the ESU LokSoundV4.0 and LokSound Select decoder definitions.

<p>
Nigel Cliffe provided definition files for two Harman DIY decoders.

<p>
Mike Mosher did a major update to the QSI Version 8 decoder definitions

<p>
Clint Taylor updated how functions are handled in the LocoNet slot monitor.
