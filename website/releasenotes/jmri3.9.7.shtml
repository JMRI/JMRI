<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next (and hopefully last) in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

The JMRI 3.9.* releases series, including this one, and JMRI 3.10 (expected in December 2014),
will be the last JMRI releases that will work with Java 1.6.  
To use any later JMRI test or production releases, you'll have to 
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or later.
All JMRI releases 3.9.3 and are tested on Java 1.8, so you 
can do the Java update now if you want to.

<p>The 3.9.5 release had some changes to XML file processing.  They're meant to be transparent
for existing files (roster, panels, etc), but mistakes happen. If you encounter trouble
with existing roster or panel files, please let us know.  Most importantly, if 
that happens, immediately make a back up copy of your files!

<p>RFID support has been changed to allow for additional protocols - existing
   CORE-ID readers <em>should</em> remain unaffected but, in certain
   circumstances, it may be necessary to update connection configuration with 
   the correct protocol.</p>

<p>The activation.jar library is no longer included with the JMRI download.
This shouldn't have any impact on you, but it's remotely possible that it
might impact you if you have your own Java code that you're combining with JMRI
and/or you're still using a Java version before Java 1.6.
(Scripts and panel files will not be impacted.)</p>

<p>Images associated with roster entries are now saved to the roster directory instead of
the resources directory when added to the roster entry. Existing images are not moved.</p>

<!-- keep this warning in place through the 3.11/3.12 development cycle -->
<p>The XmlIO web service has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed after JMRI 3.12 (July 2015).
All users and developers who are relying on direct access to the XmlIO API are
recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle users are recommended to
begin using webThrottle instead, or to plan on investing in devices that can support
webThrottle, <a href="http://www.withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a> for iOS, or
<a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org">Engine Driver</a> for Android.</p>

<!-- keep this warning in place through the 3.11/3.12 development cycle -->
<p>Several methods in the InstanceManager class have been deprecated and will be removed
after JMRI 3.12 (July 2015). This doesn't affect JMRI users, but if you have your own 
code that uses JMRI, please 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/jmri/java/src/jmri/InstanceManager.java">take a look at the code</a>
and make any necessary changes.
