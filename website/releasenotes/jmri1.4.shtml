      Release Notes for JMRI 1.4 production release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: April 8, 2004</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Production version 1.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download</p>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Although there are many important items on the to-do lists, it was
	time to put out a new production version. There are several known bugs
	that remain in this version, and we'll probably continue to find new
	ones.  For information on bugs, please see our bug tracker at:</p>

   	<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/bugs/">
   	    http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/bugs/</a></p>

	<p>Requests for enhancements (RFEs) are tracked via:</p>

   	<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/feature-requests/">
	   http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/feature-requests/</a></p>

	<p>Please feel free to add to either of these!</p>
	</ul>

	<h3>Warnings:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Panel files written by 1.3.11 and later versions may not be readable 
	with versions before 1.3.0.  Older files will remain readable, but if 
	you edit them with this version and then store them, you might not be 
	able to read them if you go back to version 1.2.5.</li>

	<li>There is no OS/2 version of this test release because our OS/2
	test machine is no longer online.  If you have a suitable OS/2
	machine and are willing to host our release testing, please let me
	know.</li>

	<li>If you are building your own copy of the program from the source
	code using Ant, please make sure to update the build.xml file.
	There have been some changes in the build procedure during the
	1.3.9 build.</li>

	<li>These downloads are significantly larger than version 1.3.5 and
	previous.  This is due to the addition of a help system starting in
	test version 1.3.8.</li>

	<li>LocoNet sensor numbering has been changed starting in version
	1.3.4!  This will effect people who have panel files (.xml files
	containing panel definition) for LocoNet block occupancy sensors.
	The sensor numbers now start with 1, not 0, so you'll have to edit
	the panel files to change e.g. LS0 to LS1, LS23 to LS24, etc.  This
	does not effect input via other (non-LocoNet) protocols, including
	C/MRI, NCE AIU, etc.  If you use LocoNet sensor numbers for the
	Speedometer, you'll have to increase them by one also.</li>

	<li>If you have pre-1.2.3 roster entries that use Zimo decoder
	definitions, you'll have to recreate them.  The Zimo decoder
	definitions have been completely reworked in a better organization
	starting with test version 1.2.3.</li>
	</ul>

	<li> Create utility package to handle string parsing, hex output formatting, etc.

	<li> Advanced preferences panel now has scroll bars if it gets too big. 
	I'd appreciate feedback on this; the sizing and resizing logic might 
	not be right yet.

	<li> Printing now removes duplicates, has better borders. Fixed a bug that 
	prevents decoders with more than 80 CVs from printing. (Dennis Miller)

	<li> Fixed bug(s) in roster that prevents changing the roster location. 
	That feature in the advanced prefs should now work. (Paul Bender)

	<li> Wangrow now shows as an explicit choice in the preferences, and as a 
	separate system type.

	<li> XpressNet improvements:  Turnout messages corrected, should now work. 
	Internal improvements to ops mode programming and throttle. (Paul 
	Bender)

	<li> Improvements to LocoNet Monitor output text for INPUT_REP, SW_REP 
	messages.  (Suggested by David Townend, more changes to come)

	<li> Larger space for address on PM4 programmer and add PM42 options,

	<li> Fixed bug causing inconsistent addressing of LocoNet sensors; see 
	note under warnings.

	<li> Digitrax Zephyr is a DCS50, not DB50 (pointed out by Ron Wojtylko)

	<li> Fixed wrong logic for one signal in SE8cSignalExample

	<li> Fixed missing "on" bit in SE8c signal messages

	<li> Jar file now carries index, manifest, so it should be possible to 
	launch JmriDemo directly from it.

	<li> Update some signal logic for the Cornwall RR signals 6A, 6B, 18A and 
	18B, add Conewago pocket.

	<li> LI100/LI101 Communications timing bug fix (corrects LI101 lock up 
	problems) (Paul Bender)

	<li> Internal code cleanup in the XPressNet Tools (Paul Bender)

	<li> Empty DecoderPro tabs are now grayed-out; an advanced option is 
	provided to suppress them completely if desired.

	<li> Another attempt at advanced preferences panel scroll bars and 
	limiting the size of the panel so it fits on the screen. I'd 
	appreciate feedback on this; the sizing and resizing logic might not 
	be right yet.

	<li> More improvements to the LocoNet monitor display of addresses.

	<li> French translation available for many menus and labels. (Francois Taburet)

	<li> LocoNet fast clock tool now available: lets you set and query the clock.

	<li> CornwallRR program has a new crossover installed, a better algorithm 
	for setting the turnouts at power up, some minor improvements to the 
	signal logic, and a new graphic (Nick Kulp)

	<li> Fixed a bug that was causing some preference options to appear multiple times.

	<li> DS54 definition file now correctly displays CV47

	<li> Jack Shall updated the appearance and added ToolTips in the 
	DecoderPro comprehensive programmer.

	<li> Dennis Miller added a "Help" system, which is accessed from the main 
	menubar.  Initial contents are Joe Ellis' DecoderPro manual (with 
	some modifications), plus some additional pages.

	<li> Paul Bender added an initial version of a consist-manager tool, based 
	on a very general infrastructure.  It should work for advanced (CV19) 
	consists on any system currently supporting ops mode programming.

	<li> DecoderPro will now use "Direct Bit" programming mode first if it's 
	available in both the command station and decoder (previously, 
	priority had been given to paged mode)

	<li> Paul Bender added a Command Station Configuration manager.  This code 
	attempts to enable only the portions of the JMRI library that are 
	useable with a given command station.  For example, with the Lenz 
	Compact/Atlas Commander, the Programmer is disabled since these units 
	do not support programing from an XPressNet device. He also added 
	code to the tools menu to disable items for which a manager does not 
	exist.

	<li> MERG decoders updated (Len Royles, Phil Grainger and others)

	<li> Support added for the SPROG command station, including initial 
	throttle support.  This has had only limited testing, so feedback 
	would be greatly appreciated!

	<li> Alex Shepherd added support for the LocoNetOverTcp protocol.

	<li> Plugin system added:  See http://jmri.org/Technical/plugins.html

	<li> Mac OS X now puts it's menus on the main menubar, making the 
	applications much more Mac-like; Updates to icons, etc, on Macintosh 
	systems.

	<li> Alex Shepherd added a new "LocoBuffer statistics tool" which allows 
	users of current LocoBuffer versions to view statistics on LocoNet 
	traffic.

	<li> A new "Decoder ID" page has been added to the web which is based on 
	the current DecoderPro definitions automagically: 
	http://jmri.org/xml/XSLT/index.html

	<li> Paul Bender added response message handling routines to Lenz Turnout 
	Code. Forced send of an "off" after an "on" is sent to an accessory 
	decoder.  This corrects the "multiple fire issue" some people are 
	seeing (And I have been able to replicate using a Switch-It, and a 
	button to throw the turnout back to it's starting position). 
	Turnouts displayed through JMRI (either through a Control Panel, the 
	Turnout tool, or the turnout table) will now react to commands sent 
	via another XpressNet device on systems that have feedback.

	<li> Paul Bender started work on Lenz Sensor code.  Skeleton in place. 
	Feedback encoders should be reflected in the sensor table, though 
	they are not currently handled. (this has not been tested).

	<li> Paul Bender made modifications to the throttle GUI code so that it 
	actually registers as a PropertyChangeListener with the system 
	dependent throttle code. He also modified the throttle GUI and back 
	end code, so the "Dispatch" button can be shut off on systems for 
	which this makes no sense.

	<li> Code for finding "DTD" files reworked in an attempt to fix startup 
	problems on certain XP systems.  Not really clear if it worked, 
	feedback greatly appreciated.

	<li> Paul Bender added ops mode programming support to Lenz.
	Fixed bug in LocoNet monitor where the Throttle ID field was being 
	displayed wrong.

	<li> Initial public release of Jython support for scripting and control 
	(http://jmri.org/Technical/Jython.html)

	<li> Bug that prevented moving the Roster location (see advanced 
	preferences) is probably fixed.

	<li> Bug preventing display of SE8c example on some systems 
	(http://jmri.org/apps/Signalling/SimpleSignalExample.html) is believed fixed.

	<li> Initial inclusion of "PacketPro" application for testing decoders 
	(nee PacketScript)

	<li> XpressNet connection can now be made via an XPA telephone adapter &amp; 
	modem (Paul Bender)

	<li> Tooltips can now be added to items in the decoder definition files. 
	If present, they override the definitions in the programmer 
	definition file.

	<li> Phil Grainger added the Digitrax DH83FX decoder, and the needed 5th 
	output function to the Digitrax "Basic" decoder definition.

	<li> Robin Becker updated the Soundtraxx LC Steam and Diesel decoder definitions

	<li> Wayne Eric provided a decoder definition for the MRC AD370 sound decoder.

	<li> Ian Havercroft updated the version identification in ESU decoders so 
	they successfully identify.

	<li> Digitrax DZ123 definition added, with ident info courtesy Robert Johnson

	<li> Jack Shall updated the Lenz 80 decoder file.

	<li> DH163 can now do direct-bit mode programming

	<li> Fix problem with creating two copies of roster entries, Bug 871882

	<li> Allow multi-line comments in roster comment fields:  Dennis Miller

	<li> New NCE D13SR Torque Compensation decoder file from Michael Mosher

	<li> Panes from decoder files (but not programmer files) are active even 
	if they contain no variables (Requested by Manhart Matthias)

	<li> LocoNet Throttles were behaving poorly in version 1.3.8, with the 
	speed slider not moving correctly.  Fixed.

	<li> Fix problem with not prompting to save file when closing window after 
	changing a speed table entry, bug 881556

	<li> Better diagnostics if a LocoNet RMI connection (LocoNet 
	server/client) fails (RFE 874488)

	<li> Peter Brandenburg has contributed a new CT_Elektronik_Sound_GE_70_80 
	decoder definition file.

	<li> Fixed bug 874472 causing DecoderPro not to have a LocoNet menu when 
	connected via a Loconet server

	<li> Added size information to several more decoders. (Doesn't effect 
	DecoderPro operations, but does appear on the selection web pages)

	<li> Improved formatting of the throttle ID in the LocoNet Monitor 
	(suggested by Glen Colbert)

	<li> Added title to PowerPanel frame so that it's easier to find the icon

	<li> Lenz LI100/LI101 connection has improved timeout logic, so that it 
	doesn't slow the computer at startup

	less-common functions, which improves build time

	<li> Added sample scripts for a siglet and a simple automaton to the 
	jython directory. Added PacketPro.bat for Windows. These features are 
	still quite preliminary, as evidenced by a lack of documentation, and 
	is certain to change.

	<li> Soundtraxx DSD, DSX, LC decoders updated by Robin Becker

	<li> Bug where decoders that differ only in family name, esp. certain NCE 
	decoders, could not be properly selected.

	<li> Roco LocoMouse has now been tested to work (Paul Bender)

	<li> QSI decoder in the Lionel Challenger now identifies (Walter Thompson)

	comments in the definition files (Jack Shall)

	<li> Tooltips added to some NEC, Digitrax decoders (Jack Shall)

	<li> New TCS M1 decoder definition contributed by Eddie Delozier.

	<li> Lenz sensor inputs now supported (Paul Bender)

	<li> Problem with Lenz throttles in top part of speed range corrected (Paul Bender)

	<li> Added "Load Throttle" as one of the available buttons/startup actions 
	in advanced preferences. Also added I8N to those items (only English 
	at present), and made the mechanism easy to extend.

	<li> Added example of creating your own button via a script 
	(jython/JButtonExample.py)

	<li> Various small improvements to panel load/store to improve robustness 
	of storing signaling information

	<li> "Simple Signal Logic" tool now allows a signal to drop red if any one

	<li> Added CV7, CV8 to the Digitrax DS54 programmer (Walt Thompson)

	<li> Paul Bender fixed some problems with XpressNet throttles that first 
	appeared in JMRI 1.3.10.  These included odd behavior in 128 and 28 
	step mode, and the speed scale being wrong in 28 step mode.

	<li> Nick Kulp contributed three new sets of signal icons, available at:
		<ul>
		<li> resources/icons/smallschematics/PRRsignals
