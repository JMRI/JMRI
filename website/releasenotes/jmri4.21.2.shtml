      Release Notes for JMRI 4.21.2 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: October 3, 2020</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.21.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->
<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please 
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release in early 2021.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.20, please follow these instructions carefully:

<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>? 
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on. 
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    then it's <u>very important</u> 
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later relese.
    </li>
    
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>? 
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release. 

</ol>   
 
Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues 
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.19.6.shtml">JMRI 4.19.6</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        None yet
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.20.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.20 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.21 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>
installing this test release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21,1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo class has become a jmri.SystemConnectionMemo
        interface and a jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo class. This may
        require changes to scripts.  If you have a script that references
        jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo, please change it to either
        jmri.SystemConnectionMemo or jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo
        (it's easier to have you just try the two than to explain which 
        one will work in which case)
    </li>
    
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The way preferences are loaded at startup has been slightly
        modified.  There is no impact to JMRI applications, but Non-JMRI
        applications that are not derived from apps.Apps or apps.AppsBase
        but are using jmri.implementation.JmriConfigurationManager to load
        preferences will no longer see preferences if an error occurs.  To
        restore the old behavior, use apps.AppsConfigurationManager instead.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.1.shtml">JMRI 4.19.1</a></span>
        The <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        calls in the various <code>Manager</code> classes
        are no longer needed with Java 8 and have been deprecated for eventual
        removal.  Their replacements are 
        <code>getByUserName</code> and <code>getBySystemName</code> 
        respectively. 
        If you use <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        in script or Java code you've written, please 
        switch to the new names.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
        There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
            <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
            <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
            <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
            <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
        </ul>
        Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
        open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.
    </li>
</ul>

            </ul>

        <a id="diy" name="diy"></a>
        <h4>Public Domain and DIY decoders</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>LocoIO programming using the Public_Domain_HDL_LocoIO decoder definition has been significantly
                  expanded. This update requires JMRI 4.21.2 or later. Because of the included improvements you are
                  advised to start with new Roster Entries for your LocoIO boards. Help files have been updated.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SoundTraxx</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>TSU2 Diesel fix sound slections, Genesis OEM Diesel add models</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>CTC Tool</h3>
        <a id="PE-CTC" name="PE-CTC"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The CTC tool no longer uses an external XML file, CTCSystem.xml, for retaining
            its configuration.  The configuration is now part of the standard PanelPro data file.
            This change eliminates issues with data consistency between the JMRI tables and
            the CTC configuration.  The CTC Editor File menu has an menu item to import an
            existing CTCSystem.xml file so that the configuration will be included in
            Panels &rArr; Store Panels.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Logix</h3>
        <a id="Logix" name="Logix"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The "Copy Logix" feature has been enhanced to provide more assistance 
          in copying conditionals. See the updated help files for details.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>new scripts ShutdownOS.py and RestartOS.py which can be called to safely
                end JMRI and then request that the underlying OS shutdown or restart itself</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Location Following" (sound follows loco) with occupancy sensors and JMRI Blocks
            now also works with a RosterEntry or RosterId as Block value.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Meters and MeterFrames</h3>
        <a id="Meters" name="Meters"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>jmri.MultiMeter is split into jmri.Meter.</li>
            <li>jmri.VoltageMeter and jmri.CurrentMeter is added.</li>
            <li>AmpMeterFrame and VoltMeterFrame are replaced by MeterFrame</li>
            <li>The user can select which VoltageMeter/CurrentMeter the MeterFrame should show</li>
            <li>The MeterFrames are stored in the panel file and restored when the panel is loaded</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>AbstractProxyManager</h3>
        <a id="Proxy" name="Proxy"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>AbstractProxyManager can now automatically create system specific managers.</li>
            <li>When a NamedBean is added to a proxy manager, there needs to be a system specific
			manager for that bean unless the bean is for the internal manager. The ProxyMeterManager
			and AbstractProxyManager automatically creates a new system specific manager if it doesn't
			already exists. This works as long as the system specific manager doesn't need to have
			system specific knowledge of the named beans.</li>
            <li>This means that, for example, the user may create a Jython script that creates a Meter
			for the LocoNet connection but doesn't need to create the LocoNet meter manager since that
			manager is automatically created.</li>
			<li>Once a specific connection needs to store specific data about meters, a connection
			specific manager needs to be created, for example LnMeterManager for LocoNet.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows launcher updated to honour return codes to shutdown or reboot host machine</li>
            <li>The Ant version invoked by Maven was bumped to 1.10.8.  No user
                action required, but developers need to be online the first time
                they build using Maven.</li>
            <li>An option (disablePermissiveSignalMastLogic) has been added to SignalMasts and SignalMastLogic
                to enable conditional permissive aspects.  See the jmri.SignalMast Javadoc for details.
