      Release Notes for JMRI 4.13.2 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: August 10, 2018</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.13.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2018.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.9.6 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running OK before
        updating to this test release.  There have been a number of 
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    you <u>must</u> 
    update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to this release.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.11.3.shtml">JMRI 4.11.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>None currently</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.10.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.10 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.11 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.8.shtml">JMRI 4.11.8</a></span>
    Some new display capabilities were introduced into Layout Editor
    during JMRI 4.11-series development.   
    This release changes some of the defaults in this area, which might 
    change the appearance of some track segments on your panels if they're 
    still using default values. If you select them and change their properties,
    then save your panel file(s), you can restore their previous appearance.
    There's a 
    <a href="../community/LayoutEditorTrackChanges.pdf">PDF document</a>
    with more details.
    We apologize for the inconvenience.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.8.shtml">JMRI 4.11.8</a></span>
    Because of changes to the "node identification" algorithm used to tell 
    one computer running JMRI from another, you might receive a warning message
    about the "Node Identity" the first time you run JMRI version 4.11.8 or newer. (If you 
    have more than one profile, this can happen with each).  There's no permanent
    problem here, but you might have to reset your window preferences (i.e. position
    and size, column layout, etc) in this case.
    We apologize for the inconvenience.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    If you are running a local web site with a copy of the JMRI content, as
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml#local">described here</a>,
    please repeat 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml#locallink">the "setSymLinks.sh" step</a>
    near the bottom of those instructions
    after installing JMRI 4.11.4 (or later).  This will make some new formatting available
    on your local site.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li><br>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li><br>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li><br>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li><br>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li><br>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.2.shtml">JMRI 4.11.2</a></span>
    The system connection preferences (i.e. hardware preferences) are now
    enforcing the <a href="jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">correct form</a>
    for system prefixes:  One upper case letter, 
    optionally followed by a number (one or more digits, e.g. "L12").
    Existing prefixes in existing configurations are unchanged, but
    new ones will have to have the correct form.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.6.shtml">JMRI 4.7.6</a></span>
    If you're having trouble getting your DCC programmer to work, try
    checking that the "Defaults" under "Preferences" are set to your
    hardware system.
    The reason: This version of JMRI (and all later) provides more options for
    "default systems": If you have multiple sets of hardware attached, which
    should be used for throttles, for programming, etc.  JMRI tries to 
    guess the right settings for these when you upgrade to this version, but 
    apparently it sometimes gets that wrong (we haven't been able to track
    that down yet). Setting them manually fixes any wrong guesses.
