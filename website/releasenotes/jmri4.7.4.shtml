      Release Notes for JMRI 4.7.4 release
      </h2>

    <p>Date: May 28, 2017</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.7.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2017.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.3</a></span>
        The buttons to start the LocoNet Over TCP server
        may not be set properly if the server
        has already been started with the program (e.g. if the
        preferences are set to start the server). 
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a></span>
        If the NCE Command Monitor window is open,
        messages of the form
        "ERROR - Unhandled (command/reply type); code: &#8230;"
        will appear in the JMRI System console.
        The NCE Command Monitor still seems to be functioning correctly.
    </li>
</ul>

If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.7.5.shtml">JMRI 4.7.5</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>Required Migration Step<span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a></span></h3>
JMRI was updated in JMRI 4.7.4 to use a new serial library. Depending on your exact
circumstances, you may need to do some migrations:
<ul>
<li>If you are using JMRI on Linux or Mac OS X and are updating from an older JMRI version,
<em>you must open the JMRI preferences and make sure that the selections are 
correct for your serial device(s).</em> Be sure to save the changes.
<p>
In general, previous versions used serial device names like 
"/dev/cu.usbserial-ABC123FG". This version will generally omit the prefix, and
use serial device names like "cu.usbserial-ABC123FG".
(If given the choice if a name starting with "tty" and one starting with "cu", 
pick the "cu" one). See the before and after images to the right.
<li>
If you are using Linux and have previously used the "JMRI_SERIAL_PORTS"
option to make sure your serial device is visible to JMRI, you'll have 
to change that to use the "purejavacomm.portnamepattern" option instead.
See the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/install/FAQLinux.shtml#usb">JMRI Linux install page</a> for more information.
<li>
If you have your own JMRI scripts to access a serial device, you'll have to update
their library references:
    <ul>
    <li>Any 
        <code>import gnu.io</code> statements will have to be replaced by 
        <code>import purejavacomm</code> statements.
    <li>More generally, any reference to 
        <code>gnu.io</code>, e.g. a reference to a class like 
        <code>gnu.io.SerialPort</code>, statements will have to be replaced by 
        a reference to the corresponding 
        <code>purejavacomm</code> class.
    </ul>
</ul>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>This version of JMRI uses a new library to access serial ports, including
        USB serial ports.  This is a major migration for JMRI, so 
        please let us know if you encounter any problems connecting to 
        your layout. See the migration note above for steps you might have to take.
            <ul>
            <li>Windows users only: this version only, fixed in JMRI 4.7.5, you 
                might have to manually remove a lib\jna-4.2.2.jar 
                file if it's present. If the program starts OK for you, don't 
                worry about this.</li>
    <li>This version of JMRI (and all later) writes a slightly streamlined
        version of panel file contents.  
        Older files should still be readable by this version of JMRI, 
        but files written by this version may not be readable by versions
        before JMRI 4.7.4 depending on their contents.</li>
    <li>The LocoNetOverTCP server has changes that may require users to take action:
        <ul>
        <li>If you have set the JMRI Preferences to start the LocoNetOverTCP
            server when JMRI starts, or you have selected a port other 
            that 1234, you need to go back to the Preferences window
            and reconfigure that. The previously-stored preferences 
            won't work with this version.
        <li>Scripts refering to
            the class jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.Server need to 
            be changed to refer instead to
            jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.LnTcpServer.</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.6.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.6 release note</a> for warnings predating the 4.6 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.3</a></span> This release will not start cleanly if installed over earlier versions of JMRI (the Windows installer ensures
    this is not an issue). Remove the JAR files <em>jackson-annotations-2.0.6.jar</em>, <em>jackson-core-2.0.6.jar</em>,
    and <em>jackson-databind-2.0.6.jar</em> from the <em>lib</em> directory within the previous installation directory to resolve
    this.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span> JMRI no longer supports the portable paths <code>resource:</code> or <code>file:</code> that
        were deprecated in JMRI 2.13. When loading a panel, an error message will be displayed
        if the panel contains a path that starts with <code>resource:</code> and the panel will
        not load until changed using an external editor. Paths starting with <code>file:</code>
        cannot be automatically flagged because JMRI allows file: URLs.
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span> JMRI applications will not load a panel file that fails XML validation; an error will be
        shown that should explains the error, allowing it to be fixed using an editor. (The
	    explanations remain a work in progress.)

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span>
        The LocoNet Server (the LocoNetRMI service; not the LocoNetOverTcp service)
        in this version of JMRI doesn't properly interoperate with JRMI 4.6 or before.
        The workaround is to update both client and server JMRI machines to the same
        JMRI version.  We expect this will be fixed in <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.5</a>.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.6.shtml">JMRI 4.5.6</a></span>  
        As part of fixing the 
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/2081">TMCC throttle issue</a>,
        the handling of TMCC preferences was changed.  If you have a TMCC
        connection configured, please go to the 
        "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Connection">Defaults</a>"
        pane in the Preferences window and make sure that the 
        TMCC connection is selected for the appropriate device types.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span> This and future releases of JMRI may not function on OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. OS X
    operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
    user's group.
    To remove Java SE 6 from OS X, follow these steps (these steps assume
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>, if not,
      adjust the following paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command <code>/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh</code> It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
          It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
        </li>
      <li><em>El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span> Support for directly executing AppleScript within JMRI has been removed
    due to changes in macOS and Java outside our control. If you require the
    ability to use AppleScript, you may be able to add this capability on your
    own by visiting <a href="https://jmri.github.io/applescript">JMRI
      AppleScript Support</a>, but please be aware that this may not work
    on upcoming releases of macOS or Java.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.1.shtml">JMRI 4.5.1</a></span> 
    Internal turnouts and sensors need to have complete, individual system names.
    The names "IT" and "IS" (without any suffix) are no longer permitted:
    "IT12" is fine, but just "IT" is not. Most panel files that contain these should
    automatically migrate them to new names when saved, but in some cases you might need to manually update them.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.3.3.shtml">JMRI 4.3.3</a></span>
    You can now set the order of your startup items: If you're opening panel files, running scripts, etc as
    the program starts up, there's a preferences pane that lets you easily set the order in which those happen.
    If you've set the order manually (e.g. by editing configuration files) in the past, please check this
    preference to make sure it's set the way you want.</p>

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.1.2.shtml">JMRI 4.1.2</a></span>
    Jython has been upgraded to version 2.7.0 with the following potentially breaking changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The decodeJmriFilename() function is no longer available by default. Use the  FileUtil.getExternalFilename() method instead.</li>
      <li>The simple propertyListener object is no longer available by default. Create your own, following the examples provided in the jython folder in the JMRI distribution.</li>
      <li>jmri_defaults.py included in the JMRI distribution is no longer executed by default, but will be executed before any other Jython scipts if included in your User Files location.</li>
      <li>The default behavior of python.cachedir.skip is now true. If using a custom python.properties file, include "python.cachedir.skip=false" in that file.</li>
      <li>Certain Python scripts are too large to be evaluated in Jython. If a script fails with the <code>java.io.IOException: Mark invalid</code> error, set "jython.exec=true" in a custom python.properties file or rewrite the script to be less than 100,000 characters per file. Note that when using "jython.exec=true" it may be desirable to run the included script jmri_bindings.py as a startup action to emulate the evaluation environment used when jython.exec=false.</li>
    </ul>

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.1.1.shtml">JMRI 4.1.1</a></span>
    Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  Definitions
    included with this release have been converted to the new form.
    If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
    validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
    Please ask on the JMRI Users group
    for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.</p>

<h3>Changes since <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">test release 4.7.3</a>:</h3>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aclosed&q=milestone%3A4.7.4+">list of included commits</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.

    <h4>Hardware Support</h4>

        <h5>C/MRI</h5>
            <ul>
            <li>This release has improved support for multiple C/MRI connections. Working now:
                <ul>
                <li>Multiple connections, with the extra ones either identified by
                    a new letter ('K', etc) or a suffix ('C2', 'C3', etc). Each 
                    connection has to have its own nodes defined via the preferences screen.
                <li>The connections
                    can be of mixed type:  Multiple serial, or multiple network, or 
                    a mix of serial and network.
                <li>Sensors, Turnouts and Lights can be defined in all the 
                    C/MRI connections through the respective tables.
                </ul>
                    
            <li>Not yet in this release:
                <ul>
                <li>You can't (yet) configure start-up actions to work with 
                    the 2nd and later C/MRI connections. E.g. if you open a 
                    C/MRI monitor in the startup, it'll be using the 1st connection.
                <li>Some of the labeling and documentation needs to be updated.
                </ul>
            </ul>

        <h5>Digitrax</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Contains a fix for the "Looping" behavior with 
                    SE8c SignalHeads seen in <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.3</a>.</li>
		        <li></li>
            </ul>

        <h5>LocoNet</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The LocoNet over TCP server has been refactored with the following changes (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/3498">#3498</a>):
		            <ul>
                        <li>The server can now be started automatically using the Startup preferences.</li>
                        <li>Server preferences are set in the application preferences window.</li>
                        <li>The server classname has changed to jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.LnTcpServer
                            (any scripts referencing the server will need to be changed).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>


        <h5>ZTC</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Added Support for the ZTC611 Command Station's internal USB connection</li>
                <li>Added a ZTC611 specific implementation of XPressNet Turnouts</li>
            </ul>

    <h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>

        <h5>Hornby</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Dave Heap made the following changes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Added the "Hornby TTS 9F 2-10-0".</li>
                    <li>Improved Hornby model identification.</li>
                    <li>
                        Replace the incorrectly named "Hornby TTS A4 4-6-0" definition with "Hornby TTS A4 4-6-2".
                        <br>
                        ("Update Decoder Definitions" from the "Actions" menu will fix existing roster entries.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

    <h4>Logix</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Logix conditionals are now directly related
              to a parent Logix.  When an existing XML file is
              loaded, any <strong>conditional references</strong>
              are automatically converted.  A review of the 
              system console for any messages is recommended.  There
              are two possible messages:
              <ul>
                <li>Conditional has no parent Logix</li>
                <li>Conditional is not in the Logix index</li>
              </ul>
              Both of these were caused by errors in previous versions
              or manual changes to the panel xml file.  After saving the
              xml file, the errors will not occur.<br>
              Use <strong>Help &gt;&gt; System Console...</strong> to 
              display the system console.
          </li>
          <li>When creating a conditional reference, the input
              field has been replaced by two drop down combo boxes.
              The first one is used to select a Logix and the
              second one to select the Conditional within the
              selected Logix.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Operations</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Train and route departure times can now be set to one minute intervals. Previously, the
        menus only allowed departure times to within five minute intervals.</li>
     <li>The option to make backup copies of manifests now also makes backup copies of switch lists.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Panel Editors</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed initial size and position of new Switchboards</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Turnouts, Lights and other elements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Egbert Broerse added the option to display the current state of Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and Blocks as graphics instead of text.
                It can be enabled in the Preferences &gt; Display &gt; GUI tab.</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Signals</h4>
        <h5>Signal Heads</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Contains a fix for the "Looping" behavior with 
                    SE8c SignalHeads seen in <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.3</a>.
                    This most commonly hit LocoNet systems, but as SE8c boards
                    can be used with any DCC system, it was a general problem.</li>
            </ul>

   <h4>Web Access</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Operations, Trains web page now auto-updates as trains are added, deleted or changed.</li>
        </ul>

   <h4>Internationalization</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sonnys Hansen improved the Danish translation</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This version of JMRI (and all later) writes a slightly streamlined
                version of panel file contents.  
                Older files should still be readable by this version of JMRI, 
                but files written by this version may not be readable by versions
                before JMRI 4.7.4 if they contain definitions of Blocks or OBlocks.</li>
            <li>This version of JMRI uses a new library to access serial ports, including
                USB serial ports.  This is a major migration for JMRI, so 
                please let us know if you encounter any problems connecting to 
                your layout. See above for some steps you will have to take to 
                update settings in the preferences.
