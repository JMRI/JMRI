      Release Notes for JMRI 4.17.1 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date:  June 27, 2019</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.17.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please 
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release late in 2019.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.11.9 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running OK before
        updating to this test release.  Once you have JMRI 4.12 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been a number of 
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    you <u>must</u> 
    update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to this release.


<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>MERG CBUS - Throttle direction changes are not always sent to the Layout, resolved in 
        <a href="jmri4.17.2.shtml">JMRI 4.17.2</a></li>
    <li>LocoNet connections - New and updated LocoNet connections with this release might 
        end up with the wrong baud rate, which will cause them to not function.  
        This is resolved in  
        <a href="jmri4.17.3.shtml">JMRI 4.17.3</a></li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.11.3.shtml">JMRI 4.11.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.16.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.16 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.17 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<ul>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.6.shtml">JMRI 4.15.6</a></span>
        Remembering the location and size of layout panels created and maintained
        using Layout Editor, Panel Editor, Control Panel Editor, and Switchboard
        Editor is no longer dependent on saving the panel.  The location and size
        values are retained using the same processes used by other JMRI windows.  This
        makes the window management behavior consistent.  To continue using the
        old behavior, go to <strong>Preferences >> Display</strong> and enable
        <strong>Use old location and size logic for editor panels</strong>.

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.6.shtml">JMRI 4.15.6</a></span>
        Starting in <a href="jmri4.15.6.shtml">JMRI 4.15.6</a>, Memories
        must have valid system names of the form "IM" folllowed by something.
        "IM123" and "IMEAST" are both valid. 
        The system name "IM", all by itself, has never been valid, but JMRI 
        will now be enforcing that:
        <ul>
            <li>You won't be able to create a memory with that name via
                the Memory table or scripts
            <li>If you have that name in a panel file, an error will be 
                logged and the panel file won't load. You'll have to 
                remove it from he file or rename it in the file
                before loading it.
        </ul>
        JMRI needs to start enforcing this in preparation for some
        future code that will appear later this year.
</li>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.5.shtml">JMRI 4.15.5</a></span>
        The handling of Turnout system names has been updated
        to be (more, hopefully completely) consistent with the
        <a href="/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">planned approach</a>.
        Specifically, case now (generally) matters in system names:
        <ul>
            <li>You can now have an internal turnout named "ITsome lower case name".
            <li>But note you can no longer refer to "ITSOME LOWER CASE NAME" or
                "ITSome LoWeR cAse Name" and get the same one.
        </ul>
        This should not require any migration for stored configurations or 
        panel files, as they have been automatically been being kept consistent 
        since JMRI 4.8.  But you might have case errors in i.e. scripts which
        will fixing inconsistent references in your scripts.
        Of course, bugs are always possible. If you find a place where 
        names seem to be handled inconsistently, please let us know!

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.4.shtml">JMRI 4.15.4</a></span>
        The calculation of Turnout Addresses for the
        <a href="/help/en/html/hardware/dccpp/Turnouts.shtml" target="_blank">
        Direct DCC Accessory Command ("a" command)</a> mode
        has been fixed (commands are now sent to the correct accessory address rather
        than 4 less than the nominated hardware address). For pre-existing panels,
        changes will need to be made to either the actual decoder address or the panel.
        If help is required, ask on the
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/" target="_blank">
        jmriusers</a> group.

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.3.shtml">JMRI 4.15.3</a></span>
        The prefix that identifies a layout connection should be a single letter, like "N" or "L",
        or a letter and some digits, like "K2" or "D3". Some older systems used to have
        longer "legacy system prefixes" like "DX", "DCCPP", "DP", "MR", "MC", "PI", and "TM".
        Those <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">legacy system prefixes</a>
        will now cause JMRI to issues a warning at startup. In this release, JMRI will
        still work with those prefixes, but they will need to be migrated to the proper form soon;
        JMRI 4.17.1 and later will <u>require</u> that this have been fixed.
        Therefore, this warning can't be suppressed
        without migrating the prefix in the connection configuration (and any associated
        panel files and scripts).
        If you're getting this warning and therefore need to do that migration,
        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">migration page</a>.</li>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.
