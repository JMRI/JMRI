      Release Notes for JMRI 3.9.5 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: November 8, 2014</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.9.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

This release has some changes to XML file processing.  They're meant to be transparent
for existing files (roster, panels, etc), but mistakes happen. If you encounter trouble
with existing roster or panel files, please let us know.  Most importantly, if 
that happens, immediately make a back up copy of your files!

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

The JMRI 3.9.* releases series, including this one, and JMRI 3.10 (expected in December 2014),
will be the last JMRI releases that will work with Java 1.6.  
To use any later JMRI test or production releases, you'll have to 
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or later.
All JMRI releases 3.9.3 and later are tested on Java 1.8, so you 
can do the Java update now if you want to.

<p>RFID support has been changed to allow for additional protocols - existing
   CORE-ID readers <em>should</em> remain unaffected but, in certain
   circumstances, it may be necessary to update connection configuration with 
   the correct protocol.</p>

<p>The activation.jar library is no longer included with the JMRI download.
This shouldn't have any impact on you, but it's remotely possible that it
might impact you if you have your own Java code that you're combining with JMRI
and/or you're still using a Java version before Java 1.6.
(Scripts and panel files will not be impacted.)</p>

<p>Images associated with roster entries are now saved to the roster directory instead of
the resources directory when added to the roster entry. Existing images are not moved.</p>

<!-- keep this warning in place through the 3.11/3.12 development cycle -->
<p>The XmlIO web service has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in JMRI 3.11 (July 2015).
All users and developers who are relying on direct access to the XmlIO API are
recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle users are recommended to
begin using webThrottle instead, or to plan on investing in devices that can support
webThrottle, <a href="http://www.withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a> for iOS, or
<a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org">Engine Driver</a> for Android.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.9.4:</h3>

<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoderAdvanced.shtml#tcsaccess">Code improvements</a> to handle some special cases in the TCS WOW decoders</li>
    <li>Lolke Bijlsma provided a definition for the Shine Plus series from Train-O-Rama.
    <li>Pierre Billon updated Doehler and Haass definitions, adding several versions for the 
            SD18A combo sound decoder, SD21A combo sound decoder, and the SH10A.
    <li>Xavier Chazelle provided a definition for the N scale Fleischmann "Leig einheit" F830681 double unit van equipped with a Fleiscmann specific dual decoder for opening or closing doors
    <li>The TCS WOW decoder definitions received a lot of attention from M. Mosher and others
    </ul>

<h4>Signaling</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Blocks now have a UNDETECTED state to represent a block that's not connected to a Sensor.
        The default signal logic treats this an unoccupied, so that a train can be cleared into
        an undetected track.  
        <p>
        Custom signal logic can use this to handle special rules for unsignaled sidings, etc.
        <p>
        By default, this is similar to the behavior of JMRI 3.6 and before.  JMRI 3.8
        treated blocks without a connected sensor as occupied, so that trains could not be cleared into 
        a block if there was no sensor configured in the block.
    </li>
    <li>Suzie Tall provided a new <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/CFL-2014/aspects.xml">CFL-2014</a> 
        signal system for Luxemburg to complete the BeNeLux set.
    </ul>

 
<h4>Operations</h4>
<p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Added more options and tool tips to the Edit Manifest Text and Edit Switch List Test
     windows. You can now show the train's name and description with most of the manifest and switch
     lists messages.</li>
    <li>New feature for interchange/classification tracks, added a "Check Destinations" button
     to the "Edit Track Destinations" window. When pressed the program will check all car types,
     roads, and loads that the track services, and will confirm if the destinations selected can
     also service the same types, roads, and load. Also checks to see if there's a train or trains
     that can also service the track and the destinations for all car types services by the track.
     The check stops when the first problem is found.</li>
    <li>New tool for the "Locations" window, "Modify Locations by Car Load". Now you can
     quickly see and adjust which tracks at a location can accept certain loads. Also show which
     loads staging tracks can ship.</li>
    <li>Fixed a minor issue when manually placing a car on an interchange/classification track.
     The program would remember which route the car was previously set out by. The program now
     clears the last route information when manually placing a car.</li>
    <li>Improved how the program determines where in a train's route to set out a car when
     manually adding a car to a train.</li>
    <li>Fix a minor problem when using a pool, sometimes the program reported a "Capacity"
     issue, when it really was a "Length" issue.</li>
    <li>Added the "Show Car Types" tool the the "Trains" window.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Control Panel Editor</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Shapes: Vertices of polygon shapes may be deleted or inserted.  Use A or D, or Insert or Delete keys.</li>
    <li>Item Palette: Additional sensor positions can be added (or deleted) to MultiSensors. See Help page.</li>
    </ul>	

<h4>Warrants</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Overrun bug fixed in NXWarrant when route was a short distance.</li>
    </ul>	

<h4>Web Server and Web Throttles</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue with very large panels getting truncated (Randall Wood).</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
        The XML output format has changed from NORMALIZE to PRESERVE. This allows keeping
        leading and trailing spaces on text in the XML file.  This shouldn't cause any
        problems with existing files, but if it does, please let us know so we can correct
        things.
    </li>
    <li>
        Analogue clocks displayed on panels can now have the colour of their hands changed (Matthew Harris).
    </li>
    </ul>
