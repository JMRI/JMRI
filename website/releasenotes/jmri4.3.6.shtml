      Release Notes for JMRI 4.3.6 release
      </h2>

    <p>Date: May 15, 2016</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test version 4.3.6 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2016.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

The DebounceSensors.py sample script doesn't work with sensors that go to INCONSISTENT state during their transition,
particularly the Sensor that indicates whether a JMRI Route is lined or not.

<!--
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.3.7.shtml">JMRI 4.3.7</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.2.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.2 release note</a> for warnings predating the 4.3 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<!-- 4.3.5 -->

<p>When sharing a configuration between this version and JMRI 4.3.4 or older, the older version of JMRI will not
    reflect changes in preferences, window position, table sorting, column order, or other user interface state. This is due to
    changes in how user preferences and interface state are stored.
    
<!-- 4.3.3 -->
<p>You can now set the order of your startup items: If you're opening panel files, running scripts, etc as
    the program starts up, there's a preferences pane that lets you easily set the order in which those happen.
    If you've set the order manually (e.g. by editing configuration files) in the past, please check this
    preference to make sure it's set the way you want.</p>

<p>The DispatcherPro, JMRI Demo, and SignalPro applications are no longer shipped in distributions. Use PanelPro
    in lieu of these applications.</p>

<!-- 4.3.1 -->
<p>The internals of the Layout Editor have been reworked a bit.  Please keep an
    eye out for any changed behaviors.</p>

<p><!-- 4.1.5 -->The code for handling Panel Editor / Control Panel Editor icons has changed
    to better deal with rotating icons.  This has changed how opaque vs transparent
    icon backgrounds are handled. Please check your panels to make sure we 
    haven't inadvertently caused a problem, particularly if you've got rotated 
    icons and/or use have custom icons with transparent backgrounds.  If there
    are any problems, please send in a copy of your panel file so we can 
    recreate the problem and fix it.</p>

<p><!-- 4.1.4 -->The configuration is now stored in multiple files within a directory named <code>profile</code> 
    inside a Configuration Profile instead of within the file <code>ProfileConfig.xml</code>. 
    PanelPro and DecoderPro both should migrate from the old configuration to the new configuration seamlessly. 
    See JMRI <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/69#issuecomment-155385101">Issue #69</a> for more details. 
    Please report any issues at <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/new">our GitHub project</a>.</p>

<a id="decoderSchema" name="decoderSchema"></a>
<p><!-- 4.1.4 -->The <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/schema/decoder.xsd">XML schema</a>
    for decoder files has been made more precise. 
    This shouldn't effect people who just use the JMRI decoder definitions as distributed,
    because they all work with this more precise version.  But if you have decoder
    definitions of your own, you may have to update them.
    Specifically, the decoder file verification will now reject a few things that it didn't catch before, even though they didn't really work:
    <ul>
        <li>There can be only one label element for a given language on a given variable.
        <li>A variable element has to contain just one type element such as decVal, enumVal, etc.
    </ul>
    As a side effect of checking this, the qualifier elements inside a variable now have to
    be at the front of the contents, and the label, comment and tooltip elements have to be 
    at the back. You can't just sprinkle them around and hope the code finds them
    (because sometimes in the past the program would miss one; now we require an order we're
    sure the code will understand).

<p><!-- 4.1.2 -->Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan requires signed drivers for USB adapters. If you've upgraded
    from an earlier version, your drivers may not work.  That will cause JMRI to throw errors
    when it doesn't find communications links.  To fix this, go to the web site for your
    adapter manufacturer, find the drivers that are listed to work with Mac OS X 10.9 or later,
    download, and install, then retry JMRI again.

<p><!-- 4.1.2 -->Jython has been upgraded to version 2.7.0 with the following potentially breaking changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The decodeJmriFilename() function is no longer available by default. Use the  FileUtil.getExternalFilename() method instead.</li>
      <li>The simple propertyListener object is no longer available by default. Create your own, following the examples provided in the jython folder in the JMRI distribution.</li>
      <li>jmri_defaults.py included in the JMRI distribution is no longer executed by default, but will be executed before any other Jython scipts if included in your User Files location.</li>
      <li>The default behavior of python.cachedir.skip is now true. If using a custom python.properties file, include "python.cachedir.skip=false" in that file.</li>
      <li>Certain Python scripts are too large to be evaluated in Jython. If a script fails with the <code>java.io.IOException: Mark invalid</code> error, set "jython.exec=true" in a custom python.properties file or rewrite the script to be less than 100,000 characters per file. Note that when using "jython.exec=true" it may be desirable to run the included script jmri_bindings.py as a startup action to emulate the evaluation environment used when jython.exec=false.</li>
    </ul>

<p><!-- 4.1.1 -->Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  Definitions
    included with this release have been converted to the new form.
    If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
    validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
    Please ask on the JMRI Users group
    for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.</p>

<p><!-- 4.1.1 -->The OpenLCB 0.6.4 library in this version has a bug in its alias
    calculations which prevents JMRI from communicating occasionally.
    A patch has been submitted to the OpenLCB group, but as they seem no longer interested in maintaining that code, it's not known when this will be fixed.
    In the meantime, the workaround is to restart JMRI and/or the hardware node(s)
    and try again; that might allocate different alias values.</p>
