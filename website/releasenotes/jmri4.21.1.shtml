      Release Notes for JMRI 4.21.1 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: August 31, 2020</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.21.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please 
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release in early 2021.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.20, please follow these instructions carefully:

<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>? 
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on. 
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
    then it's <u>very important</u> 
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later relese.
    </li>
    
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>? 
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release. 

</ol>   
 
Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues 
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.19.6.shtml">JMRI 4.19.6</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
   
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21,1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo class has become a jmri.SystemConnectionMemo
        interface and a jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo class. This may
        require changes to scripts.  If you have a script that references
        jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo, please change it to either
        jmri.SystemConnectionMemo or jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo
        (it's easier to have you just try the two than to explain which 
        one will work in which case)
    </li>
    
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The way preferences are loaded at startup has been slightly
        modified.  There is no impact to JMRI applications, but Non-JMRI
        applications that are not derived from apps.Apps or apps.AppsBase
        but are using jmri.implementation.JmriConfigurationManager to load
        preferences will no longer see preferences if an error occurs.  To
        restore the old behavior, use apps.AppsConfigurationManager instead.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.20.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.20 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.21 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>
installing this test release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.1.shtml">JMRI 4.19.1</a></span>
        The <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        calls in the various <code>Manager</code> classes
        are no longer needed with Java 8 and have been deprecated for eventual
        removal.  Their replacements are 
        <code>getByUserName</code> and <code>getBySystemName</code> 
        respectively. 
        If you use <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        in script or Java code you've written, please 
        switch to the new names.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
        There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
            <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
            <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
            <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
            <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
        </ul>
        Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
        open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.
    </li>
    
</ul>

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">Production Release 4.20</a>:</h2>
 
The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=milestone%3A4.21.1+is%3Amerged">list of included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Digitrax.shtml#deviceBoardId">
                    Instructions</a> detailing how to change the Board ID (Board 
                    Address) of certain Digitrax LocoNet-based devices using 
                    JMRI have been added to the Digitrax hardware page.</li>
                <li>Fixed a problem in the PM4Announce script</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MERG CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>When the connection is lost to a GridConnect Serial Device ( eg. CANUSB4 losing power /
                Windows Sleep Modes ), JMRI will periodically attempt to reconnect to the device.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The MQTT temporary directory has been moved to the current profile directory.
                    This will allow JMRI to have MQTT connections even when JMRI is installed
                    in a protected location.
                <li>MQTT Turnouts now support MONITORING and EXACT feedback modes</li>
                <li>When status UNKNOWN or INCONSISTENT is received from MQTT 
                    and the turnout operating mode is MONITORING or EXACT, 
                    the layout is now updated with this status</li>
                <li>When EXACT feedback mode is selected, 
                    two different MQTT topics will be used - one for commands and one for state</li>
                <li>Added MQTT Sensors</li>
                <li>MQTT connection configuration now lets you set the prefix for Turnouts, Sensors,
                        Lights, Reporters, Signal Heads and Signal Masts.  (There's no actual support
                        for Lights, Reporters, Heads and Masts yet, but you can set the prefix).
                        Note: You should check the settings for Turnouts and Sensors to ensure
                        they're what you want.  This code upgrade might have overwritten any
                        values you (had to) manually edit into preferences in the past.
                <li>The new "jython/SendMqttMessage.py" sample script show how to
                    send across an existing MQTT connection.
                <li>The new "jython/ReceiveMqttMessage.py" is simple demo of 
                    receiving MQTT messages into a script. It just prints the received messages,
                    but you can build up from there. 
            </ul>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>
        <h4>ESU</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added LokPilot 5 Fx micro Next18 variants and Pullman Silberling.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Update for some new ESU firmware features.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix some errors.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>F29-F31 now present in Function Labels pane for generation 5 decoders.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The DecoderPro programming/editing screens now have a Find operation!
                <p>
                Ctrl-F or Cmd-F will open a small find bar at the bottom of the pane
                where you can enter a search string.  Hitting Return will find the first 
                occurrence. There are right and left arrows to find the next occurrence forward
                and backwards respectively.  Ctrl-G or Cmd-G will also find the next forward
                occurrence. Shift-Ctrl-G or Shift-Cmd-G will find the next occurrence going backwards.
                The "Done" button will dismiss the 
                bar, but you can leave it up without it interfering with anything.
            </li>
            <li>Added a new optional "maxFnNum" model-level attribute for Decoder Definitions.
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Specifies the highest F key supported by the decoder. The assumed default is "28".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Note that `maxFnNum` is not to be confused with the existing `numFns`,
                        a legacy attribute that limits the total number of function mapping lines displayed.
                        Neither is derivable from the other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This value is currently used to build the Function Labels pane.
                    </li>
                   <li>
                        This value is propagated to the Roster Index and intended to be used in future by throttles, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Example definitions are LokSound 5(uses F0-F31) and LokSound V3.5(uses only F0-F15).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p>
            </li>
            <li>Added a new optional "allowResetDefaults" decoder-config level attribute for Decoder Definitions.
                <p>
                For some decoders, it's either impossible or impractical for the decoder definition
                to have universally applicable defaults incorporated. In these cases,
                setting allowResetDefaults="no" disables the "Reset to defaults" button on the Roster Entry pane
                and provides an explanatory tooltip.
            </li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher System</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher_System" name="Dispatcher_System"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>Jython based System which automates the build of a Dispatcher system</li>
             <li>Requirement: Start with a Panel with track, signals, signal logic built with</li>
             <li>automatic signal logic, sections built with automatic section builder</li>
             <li>Provides Gui to: Modify xml of panel to provide icons to setup dispatch</li>
             <li>between stops, Generate Transits and TrainInfo files required by dispatcher</li>
             <li>Provides a runtime system to operate the system</li>
        </ul>       

    <h3>Operations</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed problem where operations database was always saved when exiting JMRI.</li>
            <li>Fixed problem with Panel name for train icons.</li>
            <li>Fixed problem with track move count when track has an alternate track.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>CTC Tool</h3>
        <a id="CTC-Tool" name="CTC-Tool"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>To correct prior release notes, the CTC panel can be created with Layout Editor, Control Panel Editor
            or Panel Editor.</li>
            <li>This release gets a new capability: Auto-Generation of Traffic Locking (TRL) rules, which is the most tedious
            and difficult aspect of (any) CTC systems.  However, TRL Auto-Generation is <strong>dependent</strong> on Layout Editor, with Signal
            Masts at block boundaries, and with automatically generated Signal Mast Logic.  The Signal Mast Logic
            can be modified <strong>after</strong> discovery, but there has to be at least <strong>one</strong>
            discovery process run.  After this process is complete, if you are not happy with the way Layout Editor
            displays the layout, you can create a parallel Control Panel Editor or Panel Editor screen.  Personally, in
            my opinion, Layout Editor looks very close to an actual CTC panel if drawn correctly.</li>
            <li>There is a reminder dialog that was added to remind users of the CTC system that using "," (Comma) and
            ";" (Semi-colon) in ANY of the System and User names for items used by the CTC system is <strong>not</strong>
            supported, and may cause problems in the program.  The reminder can be silenced permanently too by the user.</li>
            <li>When CTC Runtime starts (Run CTC Logic), if there are any problem(s), warning(s) or informational
            message(s), it will now popup a dialog box to inform the user.  Previously, I relied on the System Console
            for the logging of those messages (which still happens), but the System Console screen may not be
            visible, ergo the need for this new feature.</li>
            <li>Bug Fix: It was possible (though technically wrong) for a user to specify a single turnout as locked
            in two (or more) <strong>different</strong> O.S. sections.  If this was specified, the runtime program would
            fight itself and eventually cause a stack overflow.  This is now prevented during user entry from occurring.
            If you have specified this prior to this release, you <strong>must</strong> manually correct this.</li>
            <li>Bug Fix: There was a problem that occurred when certain Java libraries were used.  The CTC .xml file that
            contains all of the data was slightly corrupted due it.  By just running this new version of CTC Editor, those
            problems will <strong>automatically</strong> be fixed. You may then exit the CTC Editor even without saving,
            as the fix will have already been done. (internal file version 5 to 6)</li>
            <li>Bug Fix: If an O.S. section did <strong>not</strong> have a Signal Lever defined, it was
            possible (though wrong) to enable Traffic Locking and / or Call On.  Now it is impossible to define either
            if there is no Signal Lever defined <strong>properly</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>
              The 'Circuit Builder' menu has been updated. See below.
            </li><li>
              The 'Edit Turnout Icon' menu item of Indicator Track popups synchronizes
              paths with the 'Add/Edit Circuit Paths' window of Circuit Builder.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Circuit Builder</h4>
            <a id="CPE-CB" name="CPE-CB"></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                	A 'change Portal Icon Set' menu item is added to the 'Circuit Builder' menu of
                	Control Panel Editor. User defined icon sets for Portals can be installed here.
                </li><li>
                	When using the 'Add/Edit Circuit Portal' window, the popup menu of a Portal
                	now allows repositioning from the 'Set Location' menu item.
                </li><li>
                	Features added to the 'Add/Edit Signal Mast' window are;<br>
                	1. A Signal list shows the signals that are configured to protect the block.<br>
                	2. Buttons will open the Tables for creation, renaming and deletion of 
                	both signal Masts and Signal Heads.<br>
                	3. Signal icons can be dragged in the fashion of Item Palette from the window
                	to the panel<br>
                	4. Instructions for these operations are described on the window.
                </li><li>
                	Two new error alerts are added to the 'Error Checks' menu item of the 'Circuit
                	Builder' menu.<br>
                	1. OBlocks that do not have a block length are listed. Every Path in a block should
                	have its length specified in order to run Warrants. But for convenience, this
                	length can be inherited from the block length.<br>
                	2. Signals that are not configured to protect a block are listed. If these signals
                	have icons they can be highlighted with a corresponding menu Item.
                </li>

            <a id="CPE-P" name="CPE-P"></a>
            Some minor changes are made to the user interface.
            <ul>
                <li>
                  For the tabs having icon sets, i.e. turnouts, sensors, etc., should all icon sets be deleted,
                  a 'Restore Default' button is displayed to reinstall the default icons.
                </li><li>
                  The above restoration feature can be done at any time by holding keys CNTL A down while 
                  clicking the 'New Icons' button.  All customized icon sets defined by the user are retained
                  and any missing default icons are added.
                </li><li>
                  The unused functions to create, delete, or restore the status states of Indicator Turnouts 
                  are now only displayable by holding keys CNTL A down while clicking the 'Edit Icons' button.
                </li><li>
                  Several new checks and alerts will inform users when duplicate names are used for 
                  icon sets or when duplicate icon sets are found with different names.
                </li><li>
                  The fixed set of Portal icons may be redefined by the user under the 'Portal' tab.
                  Portal icon sets created by the user may be selected for panels by a new menu item, 
                  'Change Portal Icon Set' in Circuit Builder. The new set is then used for Warrant displays.
                </li><li>
                  The drag and drop of icons under the 'Icon' and 'Background' tabs no longer requires naming 
                  the icon first. The drop from the Icon catalog can be done directly into the panel.
                </li><li>
				  The tabs having tables now display the element's actual table editing window when the 
				  'Add New Table Item' button is pressed.
                </li><li>
                  Editing an icon set for an Indicator Turnout now follows the same paradigm as the rest of 
                  the tabs having icon sets. Defining new icon sets, changing icons, or renaming sets functions
                  the same for all such tab items.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
        <a id="Preferences" name="Preferences"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>When a hardware connection fails, some hardware types may attempt to reconnect.<br>
            The interval between reconnection attempts and the maximum number of reconnection attempts
            can now be changed by saving your profile, then editing the profile.xml file.<br>
            The reconnectMaxInterval is in seconds, reconnectMaxAttempts is infinite if -1, else the value.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Routes</h3>    
        <a id="Routes" name="Routes"></a>
       <ul>
            <li>A configurable (minimum) interval for all turnout outputs that are part of a Route on the same
                connection can be set in Preferences &gt; Connection &gt; Additional Connection Settings (serial connections
                only).
                Default is 250 milliseconds. Up to now this delay was fixed to 250 ms in the code so this new option
                will only be noticeable if you change it. No restart is required.
                Use the [Reset] button to restore the default.
                The same setting is applied to Turnout Outputs, for example as Signal Mast outputs.
            </li>
       </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Some internal refactoring that should help with the long term
            maintenance of JMRI has been done. This may cause some scripts to
            fail until classes or methods are renamed in those scripts.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>

        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The B&amp;O-1980 signal system was updated to correct several
                    errors and to include masts which can be used to protect a 
                    block of "short braking distance".
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Signal Masts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A configurable (minimum) interval for all outputs on the same connection can be set in
                    Preferences &gt; Connection &gt; Additional Connection Settings (serial connections only).
                    Default is 250 milliseconds. Use the [Reset] button to restore the
                    default. The same setting is applied to turnout outputs in a Routes.
                </li>
            </ul>
	    <h4>Cab Signals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Better set row height in table.</li>
            </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>VSD now supports the "Location Following" (sound follows loco) with occupancy
                sensors and JMRI Blocks. See the 
				<a href="https://jmri.org/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/Main_VSD.shtml#VSDLocations">
                documentation</a> for details.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo class has become a jmri.SystemConnectionMemo
                interface and a jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo class. This may
                require changes to scripts.  If you have a script that references
                jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo, please change it to either
                jmri.SystemConnectionMemo or jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo
                (it's easier to have you just try the two than to explain which 
                one will work in which case)</li>
            <li>Added PR automation to check for a comment in the release note when a PR
                is opened, and to ensure that somebody has been assigned to the PR.</li>
            <li>The jmri.JmriPlugin class is deprecated without a replacement. If you depend on
	              on this class, please <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/new">raise an issue on GitHub</a>
		            so we can discuss how to meet your requirements through other means.</li>
            <li>"Display Message Log" has been removed from the Debug Menu. Use the
                "System Console" from the Help Menu to view log messages.</li>
            <li>The older "Upload Debugging Information" item
                in the help menu has been replaced by 
                a "Report Issue..." item.  This walks you through creating a
                <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues">JMRI GitHub issue</a> and uploads information 
                that will make debugging easier.  You need a (free)
                GitHub account to do the final submission.
                There's more info on the 
                <a href="https://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/util/issuereporter/swing/IssueReporter.shtml">help page</a>.
            <li>The interface jmri.Light has been split into jmri.Light and jmri.VariableLight. Lights
                that supports variable intensity must now implement the jmri.VariableLight interface.
                All lights are still managed by the jmri.LightManager, but a new manager jmri.VariableLightManager
                has been added that keeps a copy of the VariableLights. But register and deregister of
                all lights must still be done thru the LightManager.</li>
        </ul>
