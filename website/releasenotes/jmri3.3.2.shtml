<!-- 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.4 production release at mid-year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

The decoder definition files have been extensively reworked for this release
to reduce their size and allow  them to be translated to other languages.
Please keep an eye out for any inadvertent changes to the definitions 
that might have been introduced.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since test release 3.3.1:</h3>

Fixed speedometer opening three little blank windows.

<p>Walt Thompson fixed a bunch of links in the help pages.
<p>Walt Thompson improved the help file linking.

<p>
More graphics in the help pages will not display in a desktop web browser when clicked.

<p>Updated Standalone LocoNet help page information for LocoBuffer-USB and LocoBuffer-II use of LocoNet RailSync wires.

<p>Fixed a problem that could result in roster entries sharing a backing file if you 
export an entry and then re-import it into the same JMRI instance.  If you have done this, 
in the past, the fix is to "Recreate Roster Index" from the debug menu.

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A new feature called the "Yardmaster" window. Now you can now get a switch list for a location
     similar to the "Conductor" window. In the "Locations" window, there's now a button called
     "Yardmaster" for each location. The Yardmaster window has a combobox containing a list of trains
     that have work for the location. Only built trains with work are available.</li>
    <li>You can now independently control the build report font size. If using the text editor,
     use a smaller font size if you want to increase the amount of text per line.</li>
    <li>Some additional work integrating the Manifest Creator. There are now run buttons on the
     trains window to activate the program. Select "Generate csv Manifest" in the build options
     window to enable these new buttons.  You can also edit the file name of the Manifest Creator,
     see under Trains->Tools "Setup Excel Program".</li>
    <li>In the "Set Car" window, the destination for the car is now by default disabled. You
     should be using the "Final Destination" when manually setting a destination for the car. If you
     need the destination field enabled, under Tools, is an option to enable it.</li>
    <li>New feature, the last date and time a car was assigned to a train. Note that the last
     time and date is set when the car is delivered, or if the car was reset from a built train.
     This should help you find "stuck" cars if you have any.</li>
    <li>Improved car routing when the car has custom loads and/or final destinations. Thanks to
     Dave Cochrun and Inspector Dave in helping me improve this part of the program.</li>
    <li>You can now use the escape key to close any active operations window. All operations and
     other JMRI windows can also be closed by using the control-W key.
   </ul>

   <p>Steve Todd added an option to the Communications Monitor windows to allow users
     to filter out unwanted message types.</p> 

<p>Egbert Broerse provided definitions for the <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/RG-1965/index.shtml">Rio Grande signals as of 1965</a>.

<p>Paul Bender made some internal improvements to the XPressNet programmers.</p>

<p>Michael Mosher update the BLI and NCE decoder definitions
