      Release Notes for JMRI 4.1.1 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: August 16, 2015</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 4.1.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2015.</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at release time.

<!--
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.1.2.shtml">JMRI 4.1.2</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  Definitions
included with this release have been converted to the new form.
If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
Please ask on the JMRI Users group
for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.

<p>The OpenLCB 0.6.4 library in this version has a bug in its alias 
    calculations which prevents JMRI from communicating occasionally.
    A patch has been submitted to the OpenLCB group.
    In the meantime, the workaround is to restart JMRI and/or the node
    and try again; that might allocate different alias values.
    
<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<h3>Changes since test release 4.0:</h3>

    <h4>Hardware Support</h4>

        <p>Improved error handling during start-up when something Really Unexpected
            happens, such as configuring to connect to a port that doesn't even exist.</p>

        <h5>C/MRI</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>You can now connect to your C/MRI nodes via a
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/cmri/CMRI.shtml#net">network connection</a>.</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>LocoNet</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>JMRI can now directly program LocoNet devices that use the
                    "System Variable" (SV) protocol version 2.  Select
                    "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Addressing.shtml#SVs">System Variable Type 2</a>"
                    as a 
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/simpleprog/SimpleProgFrame.shtml">Single CV Programmer</a>
                    mode to use this, and see 
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Addressing.shtml#SVs">this page</a>
                    for more details.
            </ul>
            
		<h5>NCE</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Configure USB Tool - Removed attempted reading of the current USB cab id.
					It was not working for all cases and prevented reseting the cab id
					when the USB had an invalid (for the system currently connected) cab id.</li>
			</ul>

        <h5>OpenLCB</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The OpenLCB library advanced to version 0.6.4, which (among other things)
                    fixed a problem when trying to read broken configuration definition info
                    from a node.
                    <p>
                    Note that this is probably the last version of this library, as
                    prototype work is no longer a part of the OpenLCB group effort.
                    It's not yet clear whether a new group will emerge to maintain
                    this code. If you're interested in helping, please contact
                    the JMRI or OpenLCB developers.
                    </li>
                <li>The basic work to allow programming of OpenLCB Nodes via the
                    DecoderPro infrastructure is in place.  Later updates will
                    connect this to DecoderPro itself.</li>
                <li>A basic
                <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/downloader/LoaderFrame.shtml">bootloader</a>
                    is available for attached OpenLCB nodes.
                    This lets you install new firmware in a compatible node from
                    a local .hex file (provided by the node manufacturer). Nobody
                    has announced nodes that use this feature, but hopefully since we
                    built it they will come. 
                    <p>
                    Note: For safe and reliable operation, this relies on items 
                    that were removed from the OpenLCB specification in February 2015.
                    For more information, see the 
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/downloader/package-summary.html">package documentation</a>.

   </ul>

   <h4>OBlocks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Add feature for Tracker to follow trains into and through dark OBlocks.</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Preferences</h4>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some preferences are now stored in properties files in the  <code>preferences</code> directory within the current profile. The file <code>preferences.properties</code> contains settings that a common to all computers using that profile, while the file (or files) named in the pattern <code>jmri-&lt;MAC address&gt;-&lt;profile-hash&gt;.properties</code> contain per-computer settings.</li>
            <li>Web Server and JSON Server preferences are now stored in the above format. Although the pre-JMRI 4.1 settings files for these servers are not removed, changes to these services' settings made in JMRI 4.1 will not be available to earlier versions of JMRI. These services' settings will only be migrated to the new format by clicking Save in the Preferences window.</li>
            <li>mDNS / Bonjour / ZeroConf network services advertisements can be blocked on IPv4 or IPv6 addresses by editing the the per-computer
              preferences file to include either or both of the following lines:
              <ul>
                <li><code>jmri-util-zeroconf.IPv4=false</code></li>
                <li><code>jmri-util-zeroconf.IPv6=false</code></li>
              </ul>
              Valid values for these settings are <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Note that this is an experimental feature.</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Logix</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhancement Request #574 implemented. Can use fractions of seconds for timing.</li>
            <li>Add feature to set sensor/turnout delay times indirectly from memory.</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Roster Speed Profile</h4>
        <p>Improvements made to the UI.
        <ul>
            <li>The starting and ending speed steps can be set for measuring a profile. Also the
            increment for each profile step may be set</li>
            <li>The speed profile will interpolate or extrapolate for omitted speed steps<li>
            <li>The speed profile can be viewed in a table</li>
            <li>There is an option to merge or replace the speed profile</li>
        </ul></p>

    <h4>Panel Editors</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix backgrounds of text to stay transparent when rotated.</li>
            <li>Fix false resizing of IndicatorTrackIcons</li>
            <li>Fix spurious window names appearing under "Windows" menu</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved the script editor (Panels -&gt; Script Entry):
                <ul>
                <li>Now remembers the selected directory from operation to operation,
                    so you don't have to renavigate each time.
                <li>Use the same file selector for Load and Store, so it's
                    easy to work in one directory.
                <li>Use a proper Store dialog so you can e.g. change the
                    filename.
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Include a python.properties for configuring the Jython environment.</li>
            <li>Improve
                <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml">instructions</a>
                for making a local copy of the JMRI web site
                and providing a local XML catalog.</li>
            <li>Sonny Hansen has greatly improved the Danish translation.</li>
            <li>The Multiple Decoder Programming tool is back to being available
                in the DecoderPro tools menu.  Also, you can add it as a button or
                startup item in PanelPro and DecoderPro.</li>
            <li>The Danish translations has been made more general. It was coded as
                _da_DK, which is "Danish (Denmark)".  That's been changed to _da, which
                is generic "Danish", no matter where spoken.  If you have local translation
                files for Danish, this might conflict. Contact the JMRI list for help
                with this. Contributed translations are always welcome!</li>
            <li>The "Check XML File" option under the PanelPro Debug menu didn't need
                to be a separate item, as it was already included in "Validate XML File".
                It's been removed, please select the "Validate XML File" from now on.</li>
            <li>You can now add "Validate XML File" as a custom button via the Start Up pane
                in the Preferences.</li>
        </ul>
