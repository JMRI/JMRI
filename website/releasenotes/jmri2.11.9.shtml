<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the ninth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.12 or 3.0 production release in 2011.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None yet)

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

Development Version 2.11.4 contains significant improvements to the Powerline Interfaces. 
Some of these improvements involved a complete restructuring of the underlying code. 
As a result, previously working Preferences may now show no connections for some of the Powerline Interfaces. 
If this occurs, go to Preferences and setup the Powerline Layout Connections again. 
Then save the Preferences and restart JMRI.

<p>In Development Version 2.11.3 JMRI instituted a more robust and
transparent system for handling missing panel icon files. If missing
icon files are discovered during the panel loading process this system
presents a dialog box that allows the user to either delete the
offending reference or use the file browser to find the proper location.
Older versions of JMRI didn't always fully remove the references to
deleted panel icons. Panels which contain these stray references will
present the dialog box during the first panel load. If the panel worked
fine before, simply choose the delete option for each "missing" icon
presented to remove the stray references. Once the panel has finished
loading, save/store the panel file, quit JMRI and then reload. As a
precaution, we recommend either making a backup copy of your panel file
before diving in or saving the modified file under a different name</p>

<p>There have been extensive changes to the throttle code. If you
have written scripts that use throttles, particularly multiple
throttles, please check to make sure they still work.</p>

<p>The numerical values of "ON" and "OFF" for Lights changed in JMRI
2.11.2, along with some of the other constants in the class. This will
have no impact on people just using the program. If you're using scripts
with numerical values in them, please recode them to use the symbolic
values.</p>
