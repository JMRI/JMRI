      Release Notes for JMRI 2.11.3 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: March 1, 2011</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.11.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.
 
<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the third in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.12 or 3.0 production release in early 2011. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>Many operations improvements
<li>support for the new Digitrax DCS51 Super Chief Xtra and the SPROG 3
<li>Major additions to Logix and Editors
<li>Improvements to throttles, including web and smartphone throttles.
</ul>
along with other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>There have been extensive changes to the throttle code.
If you have written scripts that use throttles, particularly
multiple throttles, please check to make sure they still work.

<p>Due to now working checking of panel files during the load,
many users may see a popup about missing icon files.
All past versions were silent if an icon file was not found.
If the panel loaded 'clean' under the prior version, this is
due to 'dirt' in the panel files of old icon file references that
may be ignored. But save a copy of the panel file before updating.


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

The numerical values of "ON" and "OFF" for Lights changed in JMRI 2.11.2, 
along with some of the other constants in the class.  
This will have no impact on people just using the program.  
If you're using scripts with numerical values
in them, please recode them to use the symbolic values.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

Powerline interfaces for CP290 and Insteon broken. Thanks to
Jim LaFevre for spotting this.
<p>
People have reported spurious warnings when setting up multiple 
connections.  If you get one, and you're sure that you have not
configured two connections to use the same serial port, just 
click the button to continue.

<p>
Pete Cressman added support for invisible icons on panels.  The file "Invisible.gif" in the program icon directory can be selected 
as a dimensionless icon.  This can be used when sensors are stacked and allows "peeking through" a state of the top sensor
to view the state of the sensor underneath.  For example. combining two sensors to depict a 3 state panel jewel.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson updated the JMRI mini web server
index.html with entries to prefs/roster.xml and web/roster.html
Also, added automatic creation of function buttons from the JMRI roster 
to the web throttles application, including lockable buttons.

<p>
Dan Boudreau and Ken Cameron updated the NCE support to
allow more than one NCE connection.

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a bug with configuring multiple port options.

<p>
Paul Bender updated how the throttles handle notifications internally.

<p>
Ken Cameron updated the main window to 
show connection name for each line. 
Nice confirmation for multiple connections.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added a warning when trying to load an icon with a bad url

<p>
Kevin Dickerson improved the script input window.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson improved how Blocks are saved and loaded

<p>
Matt Harris fixed a problem with the System Console configuration

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added a "New Throttle Window" to the File menu

<p>
Pete Cressman added a dialog to correct or delete broken icon paths (bad url) when loading a panel.

<p>
Dennis Miller fixed some help page links

<p>
Giorgio Terdina updated AutoDispatcher2 to version 2.3.4, 
which copes with some changes in SignalHeadicon and is backwards compatible.

<p>
James LeFevre added more functions to the TMCC throttle.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson improved the ZeroConf handling.

<p>
Pete Cressman added new Logix features
<ul>
<li>A dialog will display Logix errors if any occur during runtime</li>
<li>Conditionals can be set to calculate the triggering of their actions whenever one of the state 
variable changes state.  Until now Conditionals have only calculated the triggering of their actions  
when the antecedent expression itself changed truth value.  In both cases, 
actions are still triggered according to the truth value of the antecedent expression.</li>
<li>State variables to test the status of Occupancy Blocks have been added.</li>
<li>Actions for setting Occupancy Block conditions have been added.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Pete Cressman added new ControlPanelEditor features
<ul>
<li>Clipboard Copy &amp; Paste can be done between two control panels.</li>
<li>The Item Palette can hold multiple sets of icons for each item type.</li>
<li>The Item Palette has "Indicator Track" and "Indicator Turnouts" that change color when their block sensor 
shows occupacy.  When used with Occupancy Blocks and Warrants, indicator icons will show allocation, 
path route, occupancy or error condition by color.</li>
<li>Accelerator keys added for Item Palette and Table List.</li>
<li>The Item Palette user interface has all tab items drag from a "Drag Panel" icon.  Dragging from a table
row places a text label in the panel.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Andrew Crosland added support for SPROG 3.

<p>
Andrew Crosland changed the defaults for the CBUS console to decimal, show events.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added an option in the Ecos preferences to select if we always force control of the loco when trying to open a throttle or not.

are now dynamically added via the using code.  The message preferences pane is 
now dynamically created bases upon this information.  
See AbstractTableAction and LogixTableAction for examples of its use.
The old items stored in the xml files is no longer valid, but shouldn't 
be a major issue as all these dealt with was the supression of message boxes.

<p>
Matthew Harris fixed a GUI anomaly on Tabbed Preferences window

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added the ability for the user to add icons to the panel editor via the mouse popup menu while in edit mode.   The icon will be placed at the co-ordinates of the mouse.
Also Signal Masts and sensors can be added to boundary points on the layout editor

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added the ability to find an east or west bound positionable point by either a signal head, signal mast or sensor.
Also added tools to return either a facing or protected blocks by signal heads, masts or sensors.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson has done some work on storing frame positions and sizes
via the user preference manager.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson improved the Jynstrument throttle support:
<ul>
<li>Added function control up to 28.
<li>Removed filter on kind of acceptable devices so that any Jinput device 
    can be used for throttle control (Keyboard, mouse...).
<li>Added a sample driver for keyboards.
Note: once the keyboard driver is running, all keyboard inputs will be considered even if the JMRI window is not on the front
<li>A "None" device was introduced in the device list accessible on right click, 
    avoids to have all key inputs redirected to the Throttle.
</ul>

<p>

<li>Reworked the sensor reporting code to allow it to properly convert sensor numbers to DS-64 inputs and be much easier to understand.
<li>Reworked the sensor probe decode to report which sensors are being probed, rather than the esoteric "bits a/c/b" information.
<li>Added in a decode for what I call the PANEL QUERY (0xDF opcode).
<li>Added in a decode for what I call the PANEL RESPONSE (0xD7 opcode). [Tested against UR-91 and UR-92, but not UR-90.]
<li>I found the slot read/write stuff totally unclear, so I modified some of the terms and how it prints out and got what I think is a much clearer output.
<li>Added decodes for the Duplex Group Name query and response.
<li>Added decodes for the Duplex Group Channel query and response.
<li>Added decodes for the Duplex Group Password query and response.
<li>Added logic in the SEND IMMEDIATE decode to decode F-keys F13..F28 and print something nice.
<li>Made numerous improvements in internal structure and documentation
<li>Corrected the inconsistency of "." or no "." on messages to always have a ".".
<li>Better report a request for Command Station OpSw values (slot=127).
<li>Annotated things that were reverse engineered.
