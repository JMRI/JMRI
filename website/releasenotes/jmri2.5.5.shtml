      Release Notes for JMRI 2.5.5 release
      </h2>

	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.5.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fifth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.6 production release in late June 2009. 
Because this test release is very close in content to the next production 
release, we'd really appreciate it if people would check it out and
send a brief note on their experience to the JMRI Users group.

It contains many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>Better organization of Tsunami Diesel decoders
<li>Fixes to several startup problems
<li>Better operations printing
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

This version introduces reorganized definitions for 
SoundTraxx Tsunami Diesel definitions.  Several definition files have been
removed, and are replaced by one common file.  
If you haven't modified your Tsunami XML files, you don't have to read
the rest of this paragraph.
If you have modified or replaced the Tsunami definitions in 
the program directory in a previous
copy of JMRI, you should back up the modified files before installing
JMRI 2.5.5. This version removes the old files, so if you have modifications,
you'll have to put them back manually afterwards.  In general, it's better
to put local modifications in the preferences directory, not the program directory,
so you won't have to do this in the future.

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

If you're using a MERG CAN-RS or CAN-USB unit to talk to a MERG CBUS, you should
check that your preferences are set properly.

Starting with version 2.5.3, JMRI uses a new version of the Log4J library, and 
several additional libraries.  If you've written your own
Java code using JMRI, or have your own startup scripts, you
might have to make some changes to adapt to these new libraries.
If you don't get messages about missing or deprecated methods,
you don't have to worry about this.

<p>
The XSLT location was moved back to the web in JMRI 2.5.3.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.2, Logix support has a lot of
new capabilities, but panel files that use these capabilities
can't be read by previous versions of the program. 
Please keep backup copies of your panel files in case you
want to move back to a previous version.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.2, 
there have been extensive changes to the way JMRI installs and starts on Windows.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be affected by this change.

<p>
The downloads are significantly larger due to more text and images
in the help pages, especially the updated manual.

<p>JMRI now requires Java 5 or later. (Java 5 is also called Java 1.5)
If you are using an older version of Java, please
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">upgrade your Java installation</a>.  
To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.1,
the way you drag things in the Layout Editor has changed if you
are using a Linux computer.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.5.4</h3>

<p>
Ken Cameron fixed an error in the RobotThrottle demo script
that happened when items didn't have user names.

<p>
Dan Boudreau improved printing in operations:
When printing locations, tracks now only 
show which rolling stock types are accepted;
provide users the option to only print cars that have a valid location.

<p>
Paul Bender fixed a problem when XPressNet simulator is starting up.

<p>
Dan Boudreau updated some internal deprecated references.

<p>
Fixed a problem preventing the "exclude" option in decoder definitions
from working when "include" was also in use.

<p>
Simon White added support for
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/FindBugs.shtml">FindBugs</a>
to our software build process.

<p>
Dan Boudreau updated the code to remove some Java 1.5 generics warnings.

<p>
Paul Bender improved the consisting performance and added code to handle
certain kinds of I/O errors.

<p>
Jack Shall has updated the SoundTraxx Tsunami diesel definitions so that they
now live in a single file, and share definitions of most CVs.

<p>
Matt Harris fixed a bug in the startup code that could prevent JMRI applications
from starting up on Windows.

<p>
Paul Bender improved how the connection configuration dialog works.

<p>
Peter Cressman fixed a problem with Conditional names.

<p>
In the JMRI 2.5 series, the values of Memory objects are stored in panel
files and restored when the file is reloaded.  This version fixes a problem
with replacing "empty" (null) values with a space character; in JMRI
2.5.5, empty values are restored as empty, not as a space character.

<p>
You can now use "Internal" lights with more setups.

<p>
Dick Bronson updated the signal icons for USS CTC machine schematic panels.

<p>
Ken Cameron added a new "FileLogging.py" script, which logs sensor changes to a 
comma-separated-variable (CSV) for later examination.
