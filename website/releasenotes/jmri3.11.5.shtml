<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2015.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Paths in panels that start with <code>home:</code> will not load correctly.</li>
</ul>

If any of those effect you, please either wait for 
<a href="jmri3.11.6.shtml">JMRI 3.11.6</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or pick up a 
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>This release, and all later releases in this cycle, require Java 1.8 or higher.
To use this or any later JMRI releases, you'll have to 
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or higher.
</p>

<p>JMRI 3.11.3, and therefore this version, removes some files that were present in earlier versions.
Failure to remove these can result in some portions of
JMRI (notably the web server) failing to function correctly.
If you are updating an existing JMRI installation to this version on
<a href="../install/Linux.html#update">Linux</a>, 
you must remove any older version of JMRI or unpack this
version of JMRI in an alternate location. 
The recommended update procedures for JMRI on
<a href="../install/WindowsNew.shtml#update">Microsoft Windows (run the installer)</a> 
and 
<a href="../install/MacOSX.html#update">Mac OS X (open disk image and drag to final location, e.g. Applications folder)</a> 
remove/replace the older version of JMRI, ensuring that these obsolete files are not 
present.
</p>

<p>This release uses JDOM 2.0.5, which requires some code changes if you are directly
calling the parts of JMRI that interchange XML objects.</p>

<p>There are now separate settings for the default Service Mode Programmer and 
for the default Ops Mode Programmer.  If you're using two or more system connections,
this lets you use one connection for ops mode (on track) programming and another connection
for your programming track. If you're using two separate connections, you
should go to the Defaults pane on the Preferences window and check that those 
defaults were set properly.</p>

<p> If you are making a direct connection to a Intellibox unit via
    serial or USB, you will have to reselect your preferences.
    See the 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Uhlenbrock.shtml">Uhlenbrock support page</a> 
    for instructions.</p>

<p> If you are using an NCE USB adapter, you will have to reselect your preferences
     the first time you use a JMRI 3.11 version (if you set them using JMRI 3.10 or earlier).
    See the 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/nce/NCE.shtml">page on configuring JMRI for NCE</a> 
    for instructions.</p>

<p>The Save button in the Preferences window now only prompts for restarts if required.
There may be instances when pressing save incorrectly fails to prompt to restart JMRI or
prompts to restart JMRI when it should not.</p>

<p>Because of internal code changes, this version of JMRI may not be compatible with
<a href="http://cats4ctc.org"><!-- was http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/ --> CATS 2.34</a> or earlier.  Keep using 
<a href="jmri3.10.shtml">JMRI 3.10</a> with CATS until there's a CATS update that
says it will work with JMRI 3.11.</p>

<p>The XmlIO web service has been removed. All users who were relying on the
XmlIO API are recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle
users are recommended to begin using webThrottle instead, or invest in devices
that can support webThrottle, the iOS WiThrottle, or the Android Engine
Driver.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.11.4:</h3>


<h4>Hardware Support</h4>
        
    <h5>MERG CBus</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Mark Riddoch provided a Reporter for CBus that allows for the 
            connection of an RFID reader attached via a suitable CBus node.</li>
        </ul>

    <h5>NCE</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Ken Cameron has fixed significant issues in the NCE Macro editor when
        	used with the serial connected PowerPro system (CS02). It seems
        	to have been an issue since June 2014, release 3.7.8 when the
        	NCE USB support was added.
        </ul>
    
    <h5>SPROG</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Dave Heap changed the SPROG and SPROG Command Station code so you can now use
			the full NMRA DCC address ranges of 0 to 10,239 long ("Extended")
			or 1 to 127 short ("Basic") addresses. The throttle now gives you a selector for Long or Short address.</li>
        <li>Dave Heap improved the Slot Monitor display.</li>
        </ul>        
    <h5>"Direct" programming mode</h5>
        Dave Heap added a new "Direct" programming mode choice for 
        DCC systems (such as NCE) that use both the Direct Bit and Direct Byte
        operations when programming.  Direct Bit and Direct Byte (when
        available) mean that the command station is told to use only one or the
        other, which might be useful with very old decoders.
        
<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>

    <h5>BLI</h5>
        <p>Michael Mosher improved the BLI P2 definition</p>
            
    <h5>MRC</h5>
        <p>Alain Le Marchand added definitions for the MRC sound 1617 and 1618 decoders</p>
        
<h4>Operations</h4>
   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You can now control which destinations out of staging are allowed for custom loads. See
     under "Edit Staging Track" tools "Track Destinations". "</li>
     <li>Improved build report to show trains in the route when using detailed or very detailed.</li>
   </ul>

<h4>Logix</h4>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/bugs/520/">Bug #520</a> fixed. 
        Actions Delayed Turnout and Delayed Sensor now toggle states correctly. </li>
   </ul>

	
<H4>Warrants</H4>
   <ul>
    <li>Lengths of paths within a block can now be set individually.</li>
   </ul>

	
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the Layout Editor, whereby a Cross-Over that has been snapped to grid 
        then rotated by 90&deg; fails to display correctly when the panel is reloaded. - KD</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where WebThrottle could occasionally send unwanted
		emergency stops with LocoNet and CBUS systems. (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/bugs/516/">Bug 516</a>) - Randall Wood</li>
	</ul>
