      Release Notes for JMRI 1.9.2 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: December 12, 2007</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.9.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions.
It contains 
many new features, including:
<ul>
<li>several new decoder definitions
<li>support for the fast clock on NCE systems
<li>DecoderPro is much smarter about handling errors while reading and writing CVs
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 1.9 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.0" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None!)

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

<p>
The NCE support has been revamped so that "NCE USB" is a new choice in the preferences window.
Note that this support is still experimental, and will likely evolve as NCE adds features to the adapter.

<p>This version of JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts.  This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts.  Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>This version of JMRI requires Java 1.3 or later.  
To see JMRI's plans for which Java versions will be required when, please
see our
<a href="../help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technological roadmap page</a>.

<p>For Lenz users: There are now separate choices for each of the serial-based Lenz Computer Interfaces 
(i.e. the LI100, LI100F, LI101F). Since release 1.7.3, to aid in backwards compatibility, all the interfaces 
currently have the same options as far as port speed is concerned. 
Eventually, the port speeds which are not supported by each interface WILL be removed. 
If you're using one of the interfaces listed above with this release, please check your configuration 
and select the correct device-specific option. There is no impact for LIUSB users with this change.

<p>We have added additional information to the roster files to help properly handle short/long addressing 
in systems that allow low addresses (e.g. 65) to be either short or long addresses. 
The only current system we support that has this capability is NCE.
If you have an NCE system, and you have locomotives with addresses of 127 or less,
you should open their roster entries in DecoderPro, check that the proper short or long address is selected, and save them again.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), 
otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.
 
<p>The beginnings of support for the QSI Programmer device are present, but it's not complete yet

<h3>Changes since test version 1.9.1:</h3>

<p>
Dan Boudreau updated some help pages.

<p>
Some XML-validity problems have been fixed in various decoder definition files, so they now pass the most stringent tests.

<p>
Fixed a problem what would cause the fast-clock time to jump when the rate was changed if the clock wasn't stopped

<p>
Turnouts now fire a property change if their feedback mode changes, so the turnout table can properly show their updated status.

<p>
Ian Birchenough provided a definition for the ZTC 4007 decoder

<p>
Dan Boudreau added the ability to turn off local control of turnouts with NCE rev C and CVP AD4 controllers

<p>
Dan Boudreau improved the error checking and handling in the Logix and Conditional editors

<p>
Paul Bender and Bob Jacobsen fixed bug 1829354, crash if additional buttons were selected in the preferences.

<p>
Ken Cameron updated the NCE fast clock support. The internal and NCE clocks are synchronized, and either can be master.

<p>
Giorgio Terdina updated the XPressNet monitor for the proper reporting of Command Station Software Version and Emergency Stop packets.
Paul Bender updated how it to use the correct Momentary/Continuous value when setting momentary functions.

<p>
Paul Bender fixed a problem in the way function notifications were handled in the throttles.

<p>
Bob Jacobsen updated the advanced preferences panel to show the options for startup actions and buttons in lexical (alphabetical) order.

<p>
The configuration tools for Digitrax boards (PM4, SE8c, etc) now have scroll-bars on their windows, so they can be used on computers with smaller screens,

<p>
Fix bug (introduced in 1.9.1) that prevented the Copy Roster Entry menu item from working

<p>
Add methods to JmriJFrame so you can get a list of all currently-existing frames (windows)

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed some spurious error messages when opening a saved throttle layout

<p>
The various files written from now on by JMRI can now be easily viewed in a web browser, 
but only if you have an active internet connection so that formatting information can be downloaded.  
The formatting is still somewhat rough, and suggestions as to how to improve it are welcomed.

<p>
The help pages have been reformatted so they can be properly displayed on the web site.  This shouldn't cause any problems, but please let us know if you notice any.

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed an error that would occasionally surface when closing a clock window

<p>
Bob Jacobsen added retry-twice-on-error to the DecoderPro speed table handling

<p>
Ken Cameron added a modern LCD-type clock display

<p>
Many of the decoder definitions have been updated to show whether they have NMRA warrants

<p>
Dan Boudreau improved handling of programming errors. Dan and Andrew Crosland changed the single CV programmer and DecoderPro main screen so that options that are not available are now disabled.

<p>
Andrew Crosland added new support for the SPROG acting as a command station.  Please see the SPROG web pages for more information on this, as it's still under development

<p>
Previously, if an error was encountered in the early parts of reading or writing an indexed CV, the operation would end improperly. Now, the failed write is retried a couple times, and if it still fails, the CV is marked in error (red)
<p>
Help pages have been added to many more windows, though they generally need volunteers to add content to them.

<p>
The DTDs for several file types have been brought up to date.  If you're using a smart XML editor, this will be useful to you.

<p>
Dan Boudreau updated the NCE packet sniffer inteface to add some more capabilities

<p>
Dan Boudreau added a "Confirm" button to the CV panel, for checking whether a value is correct in the decoder
