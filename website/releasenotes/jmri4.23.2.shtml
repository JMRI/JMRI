      </h1>

    <p>Date: March 8, 2021</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.23.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release in Summer 2021.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.20, please follow these instructions carefully:
<!-- Note:  At this point, we're not requiring an update to 4.22; change if needed-->
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later relese.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Logix definitions that have more than 1 conditional will invoke the conditionals in the wrong sequence</strong>.
    This can lead to unpredictable results.  The affected releases are 4.21.5 thru 4.23.2.
    For people using Logix, this upgrade is NOT recommended.</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri4.19.6.shtml">JMRI 4.19.6</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <h4>LogixNG</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
            This version of LogixNG is not backward compatible with previous versions.
            If anyone has a panel file with LogixNG that doesn't load with this new version,
            request help for it on the JMRI developers list or the JMRI users list and the author
            of LogixNG, Daniel Bergqvist, will fix it.
            <br>
            An updated tutorial profile due to this: <a href="http://jmri.bergqvist.se/Tutorial/PreviewLogixNG.jmri.zip">Tutorial/PreviewLogixNG.jmri.zip</a>
            </li>
            <li>
            The action <i>If Then Else</i> now has the options <i>Trigger action</i> and <i>Continuous action</i>.
            If <i>Trigger action</i>, the child actions will only be executed if the expression changes
            its result. If <i>Continuous action</i>, the child actions will always get executed.
            </li>
            <li>
            Menu item <i>Tools -> LogixNG -> Import Logix</i> now supports importing Logix to LogixNG.
            The user can select whenether import system Logixs or not (SYS and RTX). Currently,
            the import Logix dialog doesn't support importing a subset of Logixs. It will be a
            later feature. Note that the import tool allows the user to import the same Logix
            multiple times since it doesn't remember which Logixs that has already been imported.
            </li>
            <li>
            There are a couple of actions not implemented yet. <i>Warrant</i>, <i>OBlock</i>, <i>Clock</i>,
            <i>Audio</i> and <i>Set Light Intensity</i>. If you try to import Logixs that uses any of
            these actions, the import will fail and an error dialog will be shown. No Logixs will be
            imported in this case.
            </li>
            <li>
            If you are using local variables, the action <i>Log local variables</i> may be useful. When
            it's executed, it logs all the current local variables and their values as WARN messages
            to the log.
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.20.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.20 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.21 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>
installing this test release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21,1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo class has become a jmri.SystemConnectionMemo
        interface and a jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo class. This may
        require changes to scripts.  If you have a script that references
        jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo, please change it to either
        jmri.SystemConnectionMemo or jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo
        (it's easier to have you just try the two than to explain which
        one will work in which case)
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The way preferences are loaded at startup has been slightly
        modified.  There is no impact to JMRI applications, but Non-JMRI
        applications that are not derived from apps.Apps or apps.AppsBase
        but are using jmri.implementation.JmriConfigurationManager to load
        preferences will no longer see preferences if an error occurs.  To
        restore the old behavior, use apps.AppsConfigurationManager instead.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
        There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
            <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
            <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
            <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
            <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
        </ul>
        Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
        open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.
    </li>
</ul>
