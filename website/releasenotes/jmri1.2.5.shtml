      Release Notes for JMRI 1.2.5 production release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: August 24, 2003</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject:  DecoderPro new production version 1.2.5</p>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>A new production version of JMRI/DecoderPro is available
	    for download. The links are below, after some warnings you
	    should read.</li>

	    <li>Version 1.2.5 has a long list of updates over the previous
	    1.1 production version, including new DCC systems, new tools,
	    and new decoder definitions.</li>

	    <li>If you've never installed a version of this program before,
	    please start with the http://jmri.org/README.html page, and
	    follow the links for your computer type and layout hardware.
	    This will show you how to install the things that are needed
	    before the program will run.</li>

	    <li>If you've previously installed a working version of the
	    program, you only need to download and install the proper one
	    of the downloads listed below.</li>

	</ul>

	<h3>Warnings:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>If you haven't downloaded and run a 1.2.something test version,
	this version will require that you re-enter your preferences. You
	might want to open the preferences window (from the Edit menu) and
	write down your settings before installing this version. (You'll be
	able to go back to the older version if you need to)</li>

	<li>If you have pre-1.2.3 roster entries that use Zimo decoder
	definitions, you'll have to recreate them. The Zimo decoder
	definitions have been completely reworked in a better organization
	starting with test version 1.2.3.</li>

	</ul>

    <h3>Download links:</h3>
