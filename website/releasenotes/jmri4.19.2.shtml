      Release Notes for JMRI 4.19.2 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: January 12, 2020</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.19.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please 
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release in early summer 2020.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.11.9 or earlier, we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and make sure that's running without errors 
        during startup or on the JMRI log.  
        Once you have JMRI 4.12 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been
        changes in serial port support, panel file format and configuration options since those earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this), 
        you <u>must</u> 
        update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
        carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
        before updating to this release.
<p>If you are currently using JMRI 4.17.7 or earlier, including if the previous paragraphs
        convinced you to update to JMRI 4.12, 
        we strongly recommend that you update to 
        <a href="jmri4.18.shtml">JMRI 4.18</a> and make sure that's running without errors 
        during startup or on the JMRI log.
        Once you have JMRI 4.18 running OK, 
        store your configuration and panel files and use those from then on.
        There have been
        changes panel file format and configuration options since earlier releases, 
        and moving to the stable <a href="jmri4.18.shtml">JMRI 4.18</a> release
        is a good way to work through any possible problems.
        </p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.11.3.shtml">JMRI 4.11.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
   
    <li>The system names for Routes are required to start with "IO" to avoid
    	ambiguity or confusion with Reporters (the system names of which start
    	with "IR"). JMRI 4.19.2 or later should automatically rename Routes
    	correctly, but it is possible that references to those Routes will need
    	to be updated.
	  </li>
    <li>The Logix system names for LRoutes (RTX*) and Sensor Groups (SYS) now start with
    "IX:".  These changes are <strong>NOT</strong> backward compatible.  Once a panel
    xml file has been saved with the new names, opening it in previous versions of JMRI will
    result in errors.
      <ul>
        <li>The RTXINITIALIZER Logix will fail with an error message.</li>
        <li>The Sensor groups will not be active.  Attempting to edit them will result
        in a Java null pointer exception.</li>
      </ul>
    To recover, delete IX:SYS and/or IX:RTXINITIALIZER from the Logix table and re-create
    them.  Hint:  Use the Logix table Select >> Browse feature to get the current contents
    before deleting them.
    </li>

</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.18.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.18 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.19 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<ul>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.1.shtml">JMRI 4.19.1</a></span>
        JMRI now enforces the standard form of system names,
        where the system is denoted by a single letter or a letter plus digits.
        Some users of JMRI 4.18 or earlier might have incompatible values.
        If you have one of these hardware connections:
        <ul>
            <li>Anyma DX512 using “DX”
            <li>DCC++ using “DCCPP"
            <li>DCC4PC using “DP"
            <li>JSON client using “json”
            <li>MRC using “MR"
            <li>Marklin CS2 using “MC"
            <li>Raspberry PI using “PI"
            <li>TAMS using “TM”
        </ul>
        you may have to migrate. Please update to JMRI 4.18 prior 
        to installing JMRI 4.19.1 (or later) and check the JMRI Console to
        see if there are any instructions there. See the 
        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/MigrateSystemPrefixes.shtml">migration page</a>
        for additional information.
    </li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.19.1.shtml">JMRI 4.19.1</a></span>
        The <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        calls in the various <code>Manager</code> classes
        are no longer needed with Java 8 and have been deprecated for eventual
        removal.  Their replacements are 
        <code>getByUserName</code> and <code>getBySystemName</code> 
        respectively. 
        If you use <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code> 
        in script or Java code you've written, please 
        switch to the new names.
    </li>


<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        JMRI's scripting support now defaults to the UTF-8 character encoding for all
        script files on all platforms. This may require that some scripts be re-saved
        using UTF-8.</li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        <strong>Windows Only</strong> The JMRI installer removes the existing
        <em>lib</em> folder from a JMRI installation when upgrading JMRI. The
        existing lib folder contents are retained in the backup folder.
        <strong>This means that any files you have added to the <em>lib</em>
            folder will be removed.</strong></li>
<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.5.shtml">JMRI 4.17.5</a></span>
        <strong>macOS Only</strong> This version includes changes to how
        the final .dmg file is built, signed and notarized.  This was done to increase
        compatibility with macOS 10.15 Catalina.
        Please drag the JMRI icon to the Applications folder to install this release.
        For more information on 
        <a href="https://jmri.org/install/MacOSX.shtml#catalina">Catalina compatibility</a>,
        see the 
        <a href="https://jmri.org/install/MacOSX.shtml#catalina">JMRI web site</a>.

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.17.4.shtml">JMRI 4.17.4</a></span>
        Panel file NamedBean items such as Turnouts, Sensors, etc are now written to panel
        files in order by their Manager system prefix and system name.
        Previously, they had (roughly) been written in the order they'd be 
        read from the earlier file(s). This will result in a big change to the order
        the first time a file is re-written, but after that it should be much more stable.</li>

<li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

</ul>

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri4.19.1.shtml">Test Release 4.19.1</a>:</h2>
 
The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=✓&q=milestone%3A4.19.2+is%3Amerged">list of included commits</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a problem introduced in JMRI 4.19.1 that
          prevented the function buttons in the on-screen throttles
          from working on some types of computers.</li>
          <li>Fixed a problem introduced in JMRI 4.17.7 that
          causes a partial crash when reading in historical
          consist data from the consist.xml file.
        </ul>

    <h3>Logix</h3>
        <a id="Logix" name="Logix"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The system names for generated Logix definitions created by Sensor Groups (SYS),
          LRoutes (RTX*), Route Exports (RTX*), USS CTC and LE Slips now have a standard Logix
          prefix of "IX:".  The existing names in panel xml files will be automatically
          migrated during panel loading.  A dialog box will be displayed with the results.
          The details of the affected Logix renames will be displayed in the JMRI System
          console.  The migration will also apply to any other Logix which has a system
          name that does not start with IX.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>

        <h4>Signal Masts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Matrix Signal Masts can now drive up to 10 outputs.</li>
            </ul>

   <h3>Web Access</h3>
        <a id="WA" name="WA"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The RESTful API end point
				<a href="http://127.0.0.1:12080/json/version">/json/version</a>
				(start the JMRI web server on your local computer to follow that link)
				has been added to provide a list of JMRI JSON API versions
				supported by the running JMRI instance.</li>
			<li>The JSON services have been rewritten to potentially support
				multiple version of the JMRI JSON API in a future release.</li>
            <li>JSON services now optionally take a version number as part of
				the URL. See the
				<a href="https://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/server/json/package-summary.html#package.description">JSON Server JavaDocs</a>
				for details of this change. This should have no impact on
				existing clients.</li>
            <li>The JMRI JSON API version has been incremented to 5.3.0 to
            	reflect the above changes.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>In the
            <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/message/165236">jmriusers forum</a>
            it has been suggested to open a JMRI throttle
            automatically when a VSDecoder via Roster Entry is added.
            VSD does already save the Path and the Profile of a VSDecoder in the Roster Media.
            This PR adds a new attribute: VSDecoder_LaunchThrottle = yes launches
            a JMRI throttle automatically.
            The new attribute is stored when the user clicks the "Save to Roster" button.
            The new attribute can be changed manually or by a Jython script.</li>
            <li>Rework on Auto-Load, see
            <a href="https://jmri.org/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/Main_VSD.shtml#auto-load">the details</a>.</li>
            <li>Added a further action "STOP_AT_ZERO" for the "ENGINE_STARTSTOP" trigger. See the
            <a href="https://jmri.org/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/VSD_File_and_Config.shtml#engine-startstop">VSD documentation</a></li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Petr Sidlo added a Pragotron clock, which is digital clock
                found in many European train stations.</li>
            <li>The <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code>
                calls in the various <code>Manager</code> classes
                are no longer needed with Java 8 and have been deprecated for eventual
                removal.  Their replacements are
                <code>getByUserName</code> and <code>getBySystemName</code>
                respectively.
                If you use <code>getBeanByUserName</code> and <code>getBeanBySystemName</code>
                in script or Java code you've written, please
                switch to the new names.
            </li>
		    <li>The system names for Routes are required to start with "IO" to avoid
		    	ambiguity or confusion with Reporters (the system names of which start
		    	with "IR"). JMRI 4.19.2 or later should automatically rename Routes
		    	correctly, but it is possible that references to those Routes will need
		    	to be updated.
			    </li>
			<li>Daniel Bergqvist provided information on
			    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/githubdesktopinto.shtml">how to use the GitHub Desktop tool</a>
			    for JMRI development.
			<li>Updated the JDOM library from 2.0.5 to 2.0.6. Removed the unused JDOM 1 support.</li>
        </ul>
