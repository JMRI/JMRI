<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2015.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Operation manifests and switch lists won't preview or print unless there's a logo
     specified</li>
     <li>Some SoundTraxx decoders won't be recognized (fixed in <a href="jmri3.11.3.shtml">JMRI 3.11.3</a>)
   </ul>

   <h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

    <p>None</p>
    
<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>This release, and all later releases in this cycle, require Java 1.8 or higher.
To use this or any later JMRI releases, you'll have to 
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or higher.
</p>

<p>This release uses JDOM 2.0.5, which requires some code changes if you are directly
calling the parts of JMRI that interchange XML objects.</p>

<p>There are now separate settings for the default Service Mode Programmer and 
for the default Ops Mode Programmer.  If you're using two or more system connections,
this lets you use one connection for ops mode (on track) programming and another connection
for your programming track. If you're using two separate connections, you
should go to the Defaults pane on the Preferences window and check that those 
defaults were set properly.

<p> If you are making a direct connection to a Intellibox unit via
    serial or USB, you will have to reselect your preferences.
    See the 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Uhlenbrock.shtml">Uhlenbrock support page</a> 
    for instructions.

<p> If you are using an NCE USB adapter, you will have to reselect your preferences
     the first time you use a JMRI 3.11 version (if you set them using JMRI 3.10 or earlier).
    See the 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/nce/NCE.shtml">page on configuring JMRI for NCE</a> 
    for instructions.

<p>Because of internal code changes, this version of JMRI is not compatible with
<a href="http://cats4ctc.org"><!-- was http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/ --> CATS 2.34</a> or earlier.  Keep using 
<a href="jmri3.10.shtml">JMRI 3.10</a> with CATS until there's a CATS update that
says it will work with JMRI 3.11.

<p>The XmlIO web service has been removed. All users who were relying on the
XmlIO API are recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle
users are recommended to begin using webThrottle instead, or invest in devices
that can support webThrottle, the iOS WiThrottle, or the Android Engine
Driver.</p>
