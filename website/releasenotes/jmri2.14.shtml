      Release Notes for JMRI 2.14 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: December 24, 2011</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Production release 2.14 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

We are very pleased to announce that the 2.13 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.14" available for download today.<br>
<strong>In July 2013 we've released <a href="jmri2.14.1.shtml">version 2.14.1</a> as an update to the last release to work with Java 1.5</strong>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>


<h3>Warnings</h3>

The way in which UserNames are edited in the tables changed since JMRI 2.12.
Renames are now performed via a mouse pop-up menu and can not be directly edited.

<p>
JMRI 2.12 is the last release which is completely supported by Java 1.5.
In this release, there are minor interface features, such as 
drag-and-drop of some items, that require your computer to have Java 1.6 installed.
Computers with only Java 1.5 will still be able to use JMRI, including PanelPro and DecoderPro,
in this release except for those features.
Releases in the next cycle
will require Java 1.6.


<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

NCE turnout pushbutton lock does not work properly, solution is to upgrade to 2.14.1 or newer.
<p>
There are currently some connectivity issues for Users running Windows v7 64-bit and a Digitrax PR3 interface.
If you are experiencing issues, then please raise a question on the JMRI Users group for assistance.

<h3>Changes since production release 2.12</h3>


<p>Paul Bender has made the following updates/bug fixes in the LocoNet
Consist Manager:
<ul>
    <li>The direction checkboxes now function properly</li>
    <li>The reverse button now has some function, though there is a known issue with loosing the lead address</li>
</ul>

<p>Dan Boudreau made the following enhancements to operations.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can now show the timetable name on your manifests and switch lists.  See under Settings-&gt;Tools
	Print Options, Manifest Comments, select Show Timetable.</li>
	<li>You can now show the loco consist name and car kernel name on manifests and switch lists.
	See Print Options under Settings-&gt;Tools</li>
	<li>You can now select which staging track a train is to terminate on.
	See Options under Settings-&gt;Tools</li>
	<li>You can now optionally select 12 hour format for your manifests and switch lists.  See under Settings-&gt;Tools
	Print Options, Manifest Comments "12hr Format" check box.</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor issue with cars in a kernel and their destinations when performing a train reset.</li>
	<li>Improved build report when a train is departing staging.</li>
	<li>The program can now generate a csv switch list file.  This allows you to create custom switch lists
	for your railroad.  See Settings-&gt;Tools-&gt;Options.</li>
	<li>You can now print the loco's or car's owner name on manifests and switch lists.</li>
	<li>You can now print the car's return when empty (RWE) on manifests and switch lists.</li>
	<li>Added RWE location and track to csv manifests and switch lists</li>
	<li>You can now optionally print the route comment on manifests.  See Print Options under Settings-&gt;Tools</li>
	<li>The loco consist name is now printed on the roster when sort by consist is selected in the locomotives window</li>
	<li>Custom loads can now be defined as a "load" or an "Empty".  This is useful when using the loads and empties feature
	when creating manifests.</li> 
	<li>Manifest and switch list font size can now be increased to 14 points.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where a car would be set out to a track that wasn't to be serviced as determined by the train's direction.
	This only occurred when a train visited a location more than once.  Thank you Steve Davis for bring this bug to our attention.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem when generating a car load from staging and the spur would not service the default load empty.  Thank
	you Frank Wyatt for bringing this bug to our attention.</li> 	
	<li>You can now use a text editor to preview and edit your train manifest and switch lists. Requires Java 1.6 and jar file from
	my <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~daboudreau/JMRI_JAVA1.6/jmri.jar">site</A>. See Print Options under Settings-&gt;Tools.</li>
	<li>Improved how the program selects the departure track from staging, now if the train requires a caboose or car with FRED,
	all tracks in staging are checked.</li>

    <li>improved how panel markers (locos) save their text info.  Now when you save your panel, the marker's text size, font, etc. is also saved.

    <li>Now when the program fails to find destinations for cars
    departing out of staging, the program will list all of the cars and
    provide the option of removing the cars without destinations from the
    staging track.</li>
    <li>Added train copy feature. See under Tools for Trains or Edit
    Train.</li>
    <li>New feature, train conductor. Now you can get the manifest for
    a train in a window that updates as the train moves. It also includes a
    check list for the work needed at each location. To activate the train
    conductor, see under Edit Train, Tools, Conductor. You can also launch
    the train conductor from the train icon. Right click the icon and select
    Conductor.</li>
    <li>The program now confirms during a build that all of the cars in
    a kernel have the same departure location and track.</li>
    <li>The program now waits for the scripts to complete before building a train.</li>
    <li>You can now rename the RFID and Value fields to anything you like.  See Settings->Tools->Options</li>


	<li>Fixed a problem in aggressive mode where all cars from staging would fail to find a destination.</li>
	<li>Improvements to conductor window, you can now modify the train's set outs and pick ups on the fly.</li>
	<li>Added the operation menus to all of the major windows,
		Settings, Cars, Locomotives, Locations, Routes, and Trains.</li>
	<li>Improved the build sort in the Cars and Locomotives windows. The sort now considers the date
		format MM-YYYY where MM is the two digit month, and YYYY is the year.
		The year can be two or four digits, two digit years are converted to the 1900s.</li>
	<li>You can now change all of the track types for a location, see under Edit Location-&gt;Tools "Change Track Type".


	<li>You can now restrict how a train delivers cars along its
		route. You can now have all cars picked up along the route
		delivered to the last location in the route.  See under Edit Train-&gt;Tools "Train Build Options"</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where train icons would not appear on a panel if car, engine, or train logging was enabled.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem when requesting an engine change in a train's route.  Sometimes the program would experience a null pointer which would cause the 
	program to lock up.</li>
	<li>Removed "Unit of Length" as part of localization and added the ability to select feet or meters in the Setting window.
	<li>Changed the draw bar length when using meters as the unit of length from 4 meters to 1 meter.</li>
	<li>New feature, blocking cars from staging.  The blocks are based on the location where the cars where picked up before terminating into staging.
	So for example, if your train's route had three stops, A, B, and C, and then terminated into staging.  The cars from A would be blocked together
	when the next train departed staging.  The same goes for pick ups from B and C, those cars would remain together.  The program when attempting to
	find destinations for the cars departing staging, starts with the largest block of cars, and then checks the route, and attempts to send the largest
	block to the location requesting the most moves.  After doing that, the program does the same with the next block of cars, it finds the second
	location in the route and sends the cars there.  This is a very simplistic approach to blocking cars, it assumes that cars picked up at a location
	were placed into the train as a group.  This blocking feature doesn't consider where in the train the cars are, as some operators when picking up cars, will
	add the cars to any part of the train.  So the first stop in the train's route may not have the cars at the head of the train, but they should be in a group, somewhere in
	the train.  The first time you depart staging with this feature on, the cars will not be blocked for you, you need to first terminate a new train into
	staging, those cars will have the block tags assigned to them.  To enable this feature, see Edit Staging Track, "Optional Car Blocking" in the lower right corner of the window.</li>


    <li>You can now request that when building a train to use normal mode. Useful if your train
     is departing staging and you prefer that all cars in staging be set out before other cars in
     the train's route.</li>
    <li>Fixed a minor bug in conductor window. Previously if the conductor window was open and
     a new train was built, the window status would sometimes show 0 cars 0 length 0 tons when
     departing a location without any work.</li>
     <li>When manually placing a car at a spur with a schedule, the program now will ask if you want to apply
     the schedule to the car.</li>
     <li>If you reduce the maximum train length in the settings window, the program now checks all of your routes
     to see if any of your locations has a departure train length greater than the new length you just entered.</li>

   </ul>


<p>Gert Muller
<ul>
<li>The current implementation for Align Horizontally or Vertically computes the average of the X or Y, 
and then move the components to that in the Panel Editor. 
But then you might have to move all of them again to the place wanted. 
It would be really nice to be able to select (Ctrl-Left Click in Windows and Linux at least) 
the piece of track that does not need to move first, then select the rest of the components and 
choose "Align Horizontally to first selected" (or Vertically of course).
<li>It is quite helpful to be able to write a script to execute and then be able to save it to a file, 
and similarly to be able to load one to perhaps edit and then execute it. 
The attached patch implements both Load and Store.
</ul>
