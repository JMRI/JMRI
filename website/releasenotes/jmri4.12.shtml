<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 4.11 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 4.12" available for download today.</p>

<h3>Required Migration Step<span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a></span></h3>
JMRI was updated in JMRI 4.7.4 to use a new serial library. Depending on your exact
circumstances, you may need to do some migrations:
<ul>
<li>If you are using JMRI on Linux or macOS / OS X and are updating from an older JMRI version,
<em>you must open the JMRI preferences and make sure that the selections are 
correct for your serial device(s).</em> Be sure to save the changes.
<p>
In general, previous versions used serial device names like 
"/dev/cu.usbserial-ABC123FG". This version will generally omit the prefix, and
use serial device names like "cu.usbserial-ABC123FG".
(If given the choice between a name starting with "tty" and one starting with "cu", 
pick the "cu" one). See the before and after images to the right.
<li>
If you are using Linux and have previously used the "JMRI_SERIAL_PORTS"
option to make sure your serial device is visible to JMRI, you'll have 
to change that to use the "purejavacomm.portnamepattern" option instead.
See the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/install/FAQLinux.shtml#usb">JMRI Linux install page</a> for more information.
<li>
If you use your own JMRI scripts to access a serial device, you'll have to update
their library references:
    <ul>
    <li>Any 
        <code>import gnu.io</code> statements will have to be replaced by 
        <code>import purejavacomm</code> statements.
    <li>More generally, any reference to 
        <code>gnu.io</code>, e.g. a reference to a class like 
        <code>gnu.io.SerialPort</code>, statements will have to be replaced by 
        a reference to the corresponding 
        <code>purejavacomm</code> class.
    </ul>
</ul>

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<ul>
    <li>This release will occasionally set the default connection
        to internal, which prevents programming decoders.  One 
        symptom is getting 123 every time you read a CV.
        This is fixed in 
        <a href="jmri4.14.shtml">JMRI 4.14</a>.
        We recommend you update to that version.
    </li>
</ul>

<!--
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.13.1.shtml">JMRI 4.13.1</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>Warnings for this release:</h3>

<p>See the <a href="jmri4.10.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.10 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.11 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from a version earlier than JMRI 4.10.</p>

<p>When running JMRI using Java 9 or Java 10,
    the script import statements need to be fully-qualified:
    in addition to 'import java', you might need 'import java.beans'
    and others. 

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.8.shtml">JMRI 4.11.8</a></span>
    Some new display capabilities were introduced into Layout Editor
    during JMRI 4.11-series development.   
    This release changes some of the defaults in this area, which might 
    change the appearance of some track segments on your panels if they're 
    still using default values. If you select them and change their properties,
    then save your panel file(s), you can restore their previous appearance.
    There's a 
    <a href="../community/LayoutEditorTrackChanges.pdf">PDF document</a>
    with more details.
    We apologize for the inconvenience.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.8.shtml">JMRI 4.11.8</a></span>
    Because of changes to the "node identification" algorithm used to tell 
    one computer running JMRI from another, you might receive a warning message
    about the "Node Identity" the first time you run JMRI version 4.11.8 or newer. (If you 
    have more than one profile, this can happen with each).  There's no permanent
    problem here, but you might have to reset your window preferences (i.e. position
    and size, column layout, etc) in this case.
    We apologize for the inconvenience.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    The <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml#LE">additions to Layout Editor in JMRI 4.11.4</a> mean that
    files containing Layout Editor panels written by JMRI 4.11.4 or later will fail a 
    validation check in JMRI 4.11.3 or earlier. 
    If you back-date your JMRI version and need to to get past this, please
    <a href="#validate">bypass validation</a>.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    If you are running a local web site with a copy of the JMRI content, as
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml#local">described here</a>,
    please repeat 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/WebSite.shtml#locallink">the "setSymLinks.sh" step</a>
    near the bottom of those instructions
    after installing JMRI 4.11.4 (or later).  This will make some new formatting available
    on your local site.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
    There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
    <ul>
        <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li><br>
        <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li><br>
        <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li><br>
        <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li><br>
        <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li><br>
    </ul>
    Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
    open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.2.shtml">JMRI 4.11.2</a></span>
    The system connection preferences (i.e. hardware preferences) are now
    enforcing the <a href="jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">correct form</a>
    for system prefixes:  One upper case letter, 
    optionally followed by a number (one or more digits, e.g. "L12").
    Existing prefixes in existing configurations are unchanged, but
    new ones will have to have the correct form.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.9.4.shtml">JMRI 4.9.4</a></span>
    Due to changes in the capitalization of some method and property names, some scripts may fail until
    adjusted to use the new capitalization. The <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc">Javadocs</a> for any
    JMRI class will list the correct capitalization.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.9.4.shtml">JMRI 4.9.4</a></span>
    For Windows users only: <a href="jmri4.9.3.shtml">JMRI 4.9.3</a> (and all later) has a new 
    version of the "LaunchJMRI.exe" program.  It's used to set options as
    JMRI is starting up, and is a completely normal part of JMRI.  Because it's
    new and different, however, your anti-virus program may reject it. 
    You might get a message about "file removed" or "file quarantined" or similar
    and then JMRI might not start.
    The solution is to make sure that your anti-virus program doesn't interfere
    with JMRI's installation and running. There are so many of those, unfortunately,
    that we can't really provide useful instructions beyond that.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.6.shtml">JMRI 4.7.6</a></span>
    If you're having trouble getting your DCC programmer to work, try
    checking that the "Defaults" under "Preferences" are set to your
    hardware system.
    The reason: This version of JMRI (and all later) provides more options for
    "default systems": If you have multiple sets of hardware attached, which
    should be used for throttles, for programming, etc.  JMRI tries to 
    guess the right settings for these when you upgrade to this version, but 
    apparently it sometimes gets that wrong (we haven't been able to track
    that down yet). Setting them manually fixes any wrong guesses.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.3</a></span> 
    This release will not start cleanly if installed over earlier versions of JMRI (the Windows installer ensures
    this is not an issue). Remove the JAR files <em>jackson-annotations-2.0.6.jar</em>, <em>jackson-core-2.0.6.jar</em>,
    and <em>jackson-databind-2.0.6.jar</em> from the <em>lib</em> directory within the previous installation directory to resolve
    this.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span>
    JMRI no longer supports the portable paths <code>resource:</code> or <code>file:</code> that
    were deprecated in JMRI 2.13. When loading a panel, an error message will be displayed
    if the panel contains a path that starts with <code>resource:</code> and the panel will
    not load until changed using an external editor. Paths starting with <code>file:</code>
    cannot be automatically flagged because JMRI allows file: URLs; these will have to 
    be changed manually.
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span><a id="validate" name="validate"/>
    When loading a panel file, JMRI applications now check the file's syntax and contents.
    This process is called "XML validation"
    If validation fails, an error message is shown
    that should explain the error, allowing it to be fixed using an editor. (The
    explanations remain a work in progress.) If you have a problem loading a
    panel file, please
    <ol>
        <li>Configure your JMRI startup to first run the 
            <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/TurnOffXmlValidation.py">jython/TurnOffXmlValidation.py</a>
            script which will suppress the error. This script needs to be run
            before your panel is loaded.
        <li>Write out a new version of the panel file (after saving a backup!)
        <li>Use that new version from now on.
        <li>And drop use of the jython/TurnOffXmlValidation.py script.
    </ol>

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span>
    This and future releases of JMRI may not function on OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. OS X
    operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
    user's group.
    To remove Java SE 6 from OS X, follow these steps (these steps assume
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>, if not,
      adjust the following paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command <code>/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh</code> It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
          It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
        </li>
      <li><em>El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span>
    Support for directly executing AppleScript within JMRI has been removed. If you require the
    ability to use AppleScript, you may be able to add this capability on your
    own by visiting <a href="https://jmri.github.io/applescript">JMRI
      AppleScript Support</a>, but please be aware that this may not work
    on upcoming releases of macOS or Java.

                <li>During initialization of the LocoNet, certain EXACT-feedback messages will now
                    set auto-created turnouts to EXACT mode. As part of that, the JMRI Turnout's state
                    should more accurately reflect the layout state.</li>
                <li>The LocoNet code was updated to fully support multiple hardware connections. Some deprecated

                <li>Processing addresses in Node IDs and Event IDs
                    has been speeded-up, which will reduce (but not remove)
                    delays in table scrolling seen on some large layouts.

                <li>Egbert Broerse improved the documentation</li>
            <li>There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
                <ul>
                <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
                <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li><
                <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
                <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
                <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
                </ul>
            Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
            open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.

	            </li>
            <li>Text labels with alternate font assignments retain their formatting. (Dave Sand)</li>
            <li>The column widths for the Valid Paths section of the routing table adapt to the content. (Dave Sand)</li>
            <li>Now displays hidden mainline track sections while in edit mode.</li>
            <li>Fixed the View Block Routing selection list for cross-overs to use the actual block name
            instead of the same name for each entry.</li>
	        <li>Dave Sand fixed a problem where the wrong default value was assigned to an unoccupied block</li>
	        <li>Changed some of the Layout Editor appearance defaults, which might 
                change the appearance of some track segments on your panels if they're 
                still using default values. If you select them and change their properties,
                then save your panel file(s), you can restore their previous appearance.
                There's a 
                <a href="../community/LayoutEditorTrackChanges.pdf">PDF document</a>
                with more details.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Logix</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Three new Conditional Actions have been added for Entry/Exit.
            <ul>
              <li>Set NX Pair Enabled &mdash; Enable a NX Pair. When enabled, it can used
                  to create a route.</li>
              <li>Set NX Pair Disabled &mdash; Disable a NX Pair. This will prevent the
                  use of the pair to create a route.</li>
              <li>Set NX Pair Segment Active / Inactive &mdash; If the route is not active,
                  create the route, otherwise clear down, cancel or stack the route depending
                  on the default actions or user response.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Variable State and Action references to Entry/Exit Pairs now use the Entry/Exit system name.
            This prevents broken references caused by Entry/Exit user name changes.  The conversion may
            find missing references which will be displayed in the system log.
            The affected Variable State or Action row will be deleted.</li>
          <li>Logix may now be shared across different Locales (languages) without losing the Mixed logic
            definition, e.g. english "(R1 or R2) and R3" will display and work as "(R1 oder R2) und R3" in german.
            To apply this on existing Logix Conditionals, open each in the original Locale and click "Update" to update
            the logic to the universal format. Don't forget to save the new configuration to a (new) xml file.</li>
            <li>Fix for nested antecedent Conditionals that would break when edited in 4.11.4. (Dave Sand)</li>
            <li>Antecedents are localized for display and editing but stored in English.
                This faciliates portability between languages. (Dave Sand)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Panel Editors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Egbert Broerse improved how icons are previewed in the catalog</li>
            <li>Switchboard panels were improved to open without an Editor and with unconnected switches hidden when
            saved in that state. The turnout icons were fixed to match the state shown in the Turnout Table.<br>
            You can prevent a Switchboard from operating the layout via the Editor's Option menu.<br>
            Operating a Switchboard over JMRI Web Server and in WiThrottle has been restored.</li>
            <li>Text labels with alternate Font assignments retain their formatting. (Dave Sand)</li>
            <li>Fixed display of the icon tree chooser and drag-n-drop during icon edit in
                the classic Panel Editor.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        The following problems were fixed in the Item Palette:
        <ul>
	    <li>Text panel lost afte 2nd opening of Palette</li>
 	    <li>Background color chooser disabled after 2nd opening of Palette</li>
	    <li>Multiple family button panels displayed after adding icons</li>
	    <li>Inability to create new icon family sets for IndicatorTO items</li>
	    <li>Drag icon disappears after editing existing IndicatorTO icons</li>
	    <li>Panel background colors not shared among all Palette tabs when editors are changed</li>
	    <li>Incorrect placement of dragged items to a zoomed panel.</li>
        <li>Fixed a problem when selecting Sensors, Turnouts and other 
            items to add to a Control Panel Editor panel after sorting the items.
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights and other elements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a problem where some items would not be displayed 
                in the table when sorted by system name</li>
            <li>
                Steve Rawlinson improved the block tracking:
                <ul>
                    <li>When a block becomes occupied JMRI attempts to copy the value of an adjacent occupied block.
                    <li>When a block's sensor becomes active 'out of nowhere' JMRI restores its previous value, 
                        if there is one. This makes sense but only in the following circumstances:
                        <ul>
                            <li>if the block went unoccupied very recently 
                                (to allow for sensor flicker or other momentary loss of contact)
                            <li>if power to the layout has just been restored
                        </ul>
                        Otherwise, the new value of the block is probably not the same as it was previously. 
                    <li>Previously, JMRI always set the value, but in this release that
                        changed such that the last value is not restored unless one of 
                        the above criteria are met. 
                        It is better, particularly on automated layouts, 
                        not to have a value than to have the wrong value.     
                </ul>       
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where deleting an element from a table (e.g. Light, Turnout, Sensor, etc) 
                would cause problems during subsequent store and load of the configuration.</li>
            <li>Fixed the index numbers added to the name when adding a new range of Blocks.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>

            <h4>NX Entry/Exit Logic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Dave Sand improved the Entry/Exit support.  Entry/Exit sensor
                pairs can be on different Layout Editor panels that have been linked
                using edge connectors.</li>
                <li>The cross-checking between Layout Editor and Entry/Exit has been improved
                to prevent broken relationships that can lead to errors.
                <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/EntryExit.shtml">Entry/Exit Help</a>
                has been updated.

        <h4>Signal Masts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Signal mast logic pair discovery improved to handle complex Layout Editor track plans. (Dave Sand)</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Egbert Broerse improved the documentation, including the index pages for the individual systems</li>
                <li>Petr &#352;&#237;dlo added five sets of definitions for Czechoslovak State Railways
                <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/CSD-1962-zakladni/index.shtml">1962/2015 &#268;SD</a>
                aspect signaling.</li>
                <li>Dick Bronson provided a new <a href="jmri.org/xml/signals/PRR-1956">PRR 1956 signal system</a></li>
            </ul>

    	<h4>Simple Signal Logic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Egbert Broerse improved the documentation</li>
                <li>The set masts at slip process was displaying a dialog about a missing combo box block selection when
                 the block has already been assigned to the slip switch.
                 This made it impossible to assign signal masts to block boundaries at slip switches.
                 Dave Sand fixed it.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Resources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chuck Catania added <a href="http:/jmri.org/resources/icons/USS/plate/base-plates/misc/">icons</a>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>YetAnotherAutoTrain.py</strong> &mdash; Another script for running trains that
            uses English like phrases to describe the train actions.</li>
            <li>Scripts that access the <strong>Connection List</strong> may need to be modified.  An
            <strong>AttributeError</strong> may occur: <em>javax.script.ScriptException: AttributeError:
            type object 'jmri.InstanceManager' has no attribute 'configureManagerInstance' in
            &lt;script&gt; at line number 14</em>.  Use <strong><em>connectionList =
            jmri.InstanceManager.getDefault(jmri.jmrix.ConnectionConfigManager).getConnections()</em></strong></li>
        </ul>

                phrases. Translators please review.</li>
        </ul>
 
    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dave Sand's 
                <a href="http://jmri.org/scripts/RaspberryPiShutdown.py">RaspberryPiShutdown.py</a> 
                sample script can shutdown both JMRI and the Raspberry Pi (or other Linux machine)
                it's running on. You can invoke via a Logix or other controls when you want to shutdown
                power on your layout.</li>
            <li>The LocoNet Scripting examples were updated to support multiple LocoNet connections.
                If you are using your own scripts with LocoNet, update lines of code that read
            <pre>jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnTrafficController.instance()</pre> to
            <pre>jmri.InstanceManager.getList(jmri.jmrix.loconet.LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo).get(0).getLnTrafficController()</pre>

	        <li>when running, a warrant will not allocate or throw turnouts beyond signal's stop aspect or 
	    	    past an occupied block.  Once cleared to proceede, the warrant will set the turnouts to 
	    	    continue its route</li>
            <li>A hidden column was added to the OBlock table enabling a block to be allocated/deAllocated 
	    	    to a warrrant. (Reminder- "right click" the column header to make columns visible)</li>
