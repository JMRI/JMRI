      Release Notes for JMRI 4.9.1 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: July 23, 2017</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.9.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2017.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Required Migration Step<span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a></span></h3>
JMRI was updated in JMRI 4.7.4 to use a new serial library. Depending on your exact
circumstances, you may need to do some migrations:
<ul>
<li>If you are using JMRI on Linux or Mac OS X and are updating from an older JMRI version,
<em>you must open the JMRI preferences and make sure that the selections are 
correct for your serial device(s).</em> Be sure to save the changes.
<p>
In general, previous versions used serial device names like 
"/dev/cu.usbserial-ABC123FG". This version will generally omit the prefix, and
use serial device names like "cu.usbserial-ABC123FG".
(If given the choice between a name starting with "tty" and one starting with "cu", 
pick the "cu" one). See the before and after images to the right.
<li>
If you are using Linux and have previously used the "JMRI_SERIAL_PORTS"
option to make sure your serial device is visible to JMRI, you'll have 
to change that to use the "purejavacomm.portnamepattern" option instead.
See the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/install/FAQLinux.shtml#usb">JMRI Linux install page</a> for more information.
<li>
If you use your own JMRI scripts to access a serial device, you'll have to update
their library references:
    <ul>
    <li>Any 
        <code>import gnu.io</code> statements will have to be replaced by 
        <code>import purejavacomm</code> statements.
    <li>More generally, any reference to 
        <code>gnu.io</code>, e.g. a reference to a class like 
        <code>gnu.io.SerialPort</code>, statements will have to be replaced by 
        a reference to the corresponding 
        <code>purejavacomm</code> class.
    </ul>
</ul>


<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.9.1.shtml">JMRI 4.9.1</a>, fixed <a href="jmri4.9.2.shtml">4.9.2</a></span>
        JMRI 4.9.1 will sometimes refuse to create a new profile.  This can
        hit when creating a new profile in addition to existing ones, or 
        when creating a new profile as part of an initial install.  
        There is, unfortunately, no workaround for this.  Since it can
        hit new users, we recommend that completely new users <b>not</b>
        use JMRI 4.9.1, but rather should <b>stick with
        <a href="jmri4.8.shtml">JMRI 4.8</a></b>. This has been fixed for JMRI 4.9.2.
        You can also pick up a 
        <a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
        in the meantime.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.9.1.shtml">JMRI 4.9.1</a>, fixed <a href="jmri4.9.2.shtml">4.9.2</a></span>
        If you have very large panels (lots and lots of items), JMRI PanelPro can 
        start to slow down.  This has been fixed for JMRI 4.9.2.
        You can also pick up a 
        <a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
        in the meantime.
    </li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.9.2.shtml">JMRI 4.9.2</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.8.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.8 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.9 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.5.shtml">JMRI 4.7.5</a></span>
    This version of JMRI (and all later) writes a slightly streamlined
    version of panel file contents.  
    Older files should still be readable by this version of JMRI, 
    but files written by this version may not be readable by versions
    before JMRI 4.2 depending on their contents.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.5.shtml">JMRI 4.7.5</a></span>
    The LocoNetOverTCP server has changes that may break scripts that reference it. Scripts refering to
    the class jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.Server need to refer instead to
    jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.LnTcpServer.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.3</a></span> 
    This release will not start cleanly if installed over earlier versions of JMRI (the Windows installer ensures
    this is not an issue). Remove the JAR files <em>jackson-annotations-2.0.6.jar</em>, <em>jackson-core-2.0.6.jar</em>,
    and <em>jackson-databind-2.0.6.jar</em> from the <em>lib</em> directory within the previous installation directory to resolve
    this.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span> JMRI no longer supports the portable paths <code>resource:</code> or <code>file:</code> that
        were deprecated in JMRI 2.13. When loading a panel, an error message will be displayed
        if the panel contains a path that starts with <code>resource:</code> and the panel will
        not load until changed using an external editor. Paths starting with <code>file:</code>
        cannot be automatically flagged because JMRI allows file: URLs.
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span>
        The LocoNet Server (the LocoNetRMI service; not the LocoNetOverTcp service)
        in this version of JMRI doesn't properly interoperate with 
        <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a> through <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a>.
        It does work fine with <a href="jmri4.6.shtml">JMRI version 4.6</a> or before.
        If you encounter a problem with version compatibility, you'll see an error
        message that includes "<code>local class incompatible</code>".
        The workaround is to update both client and server JMRI machines to the same
        JMRI version. 
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span> JMRI applications will not load a panel file that fails XML validation; an error will be
        shown that should explains the error, allowing it to be fixed using an editor. (The
	    explanations remain a work in progress.)

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.6.shtml">JMRI 4.5.6</a></span>  
        As part of fixing the 
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/2081">TMCC throttle issue</a>,
        the handling of TMCC preferences was changed.  If you have a TMCC
        connection configured, please go to the 
        "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Connection">Defaults</a>"
        pane in the Preferences window and make sure that the 
        TMCC connection is selected for the appropriate device types.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span> This and future releases of JMRI may not function on macOS / OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. macOS
    operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6, but it may be reinstalled with other software programs. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
    user's group.
    To remove Java SE 6 from macOS / OS X, follow these steps (these steps assume
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>; if you've installed it in a different location,
      adjust the following paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>OS X El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command <code>/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh</code><br>It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>OS X El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
         <br>It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
        </li>
      <li><em>OS X El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span> Support for directly executing AppleScript within JMRI has been removed
    due to changes in macOS and Java outside our control. If you require the
    ability to use AppleScript, you may be able to add this capability on your
    own by visiting <a href="https://jmri.github.io/applescript">JMRI
      AppleScript Support</a>, but please be aware that this may not work
    on upcoming releases of macOS or Java.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.1.shtml">JMRI 4.5.1</a></span> 
    Internal turnouts and sensors need to have complete, individual system names.
    The names "IT" and "IS" (without any suffix) are no longer permitted:
    "IT12" is fine, but just "IT" is not. Most panel files that contain these should
    automatically migrate them to new names when saved, but in some cases you might need to manually update them.

	        <li>Some of the text boxes for entering input (e.g. names of items to add)
	            have been updated to selection boxes.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Panel Editors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A problem with reading really old panel files (pre-JMRI 4.0) was fixed.
        </ul>

    <h3>Resources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chuck Catania added some ATSF CTC icons.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights and other elements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Turnout Table now makes it clear(er) which turnouts can 
                use the turnout locking feature and which Connections don't have it available.
                </li>
            <li>Improved the turnout locking GUI in the Turnout Table to make it
                clearer what's going on.
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added SensorGroupAutoItem sample script to handle the case of an "all-but-one" group.
                For example, if you have sensor inputs for the left and right positions of a CTC signal level, 
                but not the center one, this will let you use an internal sensor for that position.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
    	<h4>Simple Signal Logic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>SSL now has a "Restricting Speed" option that limits the 
                fastest shown appearance to Flashing Red (Restricting).  This can be
                useful in the entrance to a yard. A script can turn it on and off
                for e.g. permission to switch on a lead.</li>
            </ul>

	    <h4>USS CTC Logic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added Route and Traffic lock capabilities.</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>

   <h3>Web Access</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved handling of roster entry IDs:
                <ul>
                <li>URL-encode roster entry Ids in URL paths and only in URL paths.
                <li>Accept URL-encoded roster entry Ids in request paths in the Roster servlet.
                <li>Accept URL-encoded types and object Ids in request paths in the JSON servlet.
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Internationalization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>CAN, M&auml;rklin, C/MRI, ECoS, Roco and Lenz tools were slightly updated and fully support translations (Egbert Broerse)</li>
            <li>Egbert Broerse expanded the German and Dutch translations</li>
            <li>Sonnys Hansen expanded the Danish translation</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Made some changes to how JMRI validates panel files to accept how AnyRail writes the files.</li>
            <li>Quite a bit of code that has been deprecated since JMRI 4.2 or before was removed.</li>
            <li>A problem with validating XML panel files created by XtrkCadReader was bypassed.</li>
            <li>USB support using the USB library has been <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/3679">updated to usb4java</a> and a new USB browser added.</li>
        </ul>
