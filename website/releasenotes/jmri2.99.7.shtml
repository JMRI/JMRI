<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.0 production release, probably in Summer 2012.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

None

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

The consist tool when connected to a NCE command station will not always show all of the available consists, usually 127, 126, and 125 are missing.
As an alternative, you can use the NCE consist tool.  We expect to have this problem fixed in the next test release.
