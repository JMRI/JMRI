      Release Notes for JMRI 4.5.1 release
      </h2>

    <p>Date: July 10, 2016</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test version 4.5.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2016.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
Two spurious messages are emitted at startup:<br/>
startup.StartupActionModelUtil        ERROR - Did not find class "jmri.jmrix.srcp.srcpmon.SRCPMonAction" [main]<br/>
startup.StartupActionModelUtil        ERROR - Did not find class "jmri.jmrix.srcp.packetgen.PacketGenAction" [main]<br/>
Unless you're using a SRCP connection, these are not a problem, just an annoyance. They're fixed in JMRI 4.5.2.
  </li>
  <li>JMRI does not work on OS X unless a JDK is installed. This is fixed in version 4.5.2 (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1679">#1679</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>If you use the SRCP system connection and have configured JMRI Preferences
        to open SRCP tool windows when JMRI starts, you'll have to reset those preferences.</li>
    <li>LocoTools, no longer supported since JMRI 2.10, has been removed from the Linux and OS X distributions.</li>
    <li>Internal turnouts and sensors need to have complete, individual system names.  The names "IT" and "IS" (without any
    suffix) are no longer permitted: "IT12" is fine, but just "IT" is not. Most panel files that contain these should
    automatically migrate them to new names when saved, but in some cases you might need to manually update them.
    <li>This and future versions of JMRI may not function on OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. OS X
      operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
      user's group.
      <p>To remove Java SE 6 from OS X, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>Download <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/raw/master/scripts/MacOSXapps/TemplateApp.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh">uninstall-java6.sh</a>.
          The rest of these steps assume you downloaded it to your <em>Downloads</em> folder.</li>
        <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
          <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
            Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
            select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
          </li>
        <li>Run the command <code>bash ~/Downloads/uninstall-java6.sh</code> It can take
          up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
          <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/your-user-name/Downloads/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
            It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
          </li>
        <li><em>El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Due to changes in the libraries shipped with 4.5.1 compared to earlier releases, if you choose to revert to
    an earlier release after installing 4.5.1 without completely uninstalling, the 'lib' directory will contain extra
    files that will cause problems running JMRI. If needing to revert to an earlier version, we recommend you to uninstall
    4.5.1 first prior to installing the earlier version.
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.4.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.4 release note</a> for warnings predating the 4.4 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.3.5)</em> When sharing a configuration between this version and JMRI 4.3.4 or older, the older version of JMRI will not
    reflect changes in preferences, window position, table sorting, column order, or other user interface state. This is due to
    changes in how user preferences and interface state are stored.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.3.3)</em> You can now set the order of your startup items: If you're opening panel files, running scripts, etc as
    the program starts up, there's a preferences pane that lets you easily set the order in which those happen.
    If you've set the order manually (e.g. by editing configuration files) in the past, please check this
    preference to make sure it's set the way you want.</p>

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.1.2)</em> Jython has been upgraded to version 2.7.0 with the following potentially breaking changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The decodeJmriFilename() function is no longer available by default. Use the  FileUtil.getExternalFilename() method instead.</li>
      <li>The simple propertyListener object is no longer available by default. Create your own, following the examples provided in the jython folder in the JMRI distribution.</li>
      <li>jmri_defaults.py included in the JMRI distribution is no longer executed by default, but will be executed before any other Jython scipts if included in your User Files location.</li>
      <li>The default behavior of python.cachedir.skip is now true. If using a custom python.properties file, include "python.cachedir.skip=false" in that file.</li>
      <li>Certain Python scripts are too large to be evaluated in Jython. If a script fails with the <code>java.io.IOException: Mark invalid</code> error, set "jython.exec=true" in a custom python.properties file or rewrite the script to be less than 100,000 characters per file. Note that when using "jython.exec=true" it may be desirable to run the included script jmri_bindings.py as a startup action to emulate the evaluation environment used when jython.exec=false.</li>
    </ul>

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.1.1)</em> Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  Definitions
    included with this release have been converted to the new form.
    If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
    validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
    Please ask on the JMRI Users group
    for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.</p>

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.1.1)</em> The OpenLCB 0.6.4 library in this version has a bug in its alias
    calculations which prevents JMRI from communicating occasionally.
    A patch has been submitted to the OpenLCB group, but as they seem no longer interested in maintaining that code, it's not known when this will be fixed.
    In the meantime, the workaround is to restart JMRI and/or the hardware node(s)
    and try again; that might allocate different alias values. </p>

            </ul>


   <h4>Operations</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>New feature, you can now see and modify the track "Moves" that are used to determine
     the order tracks are processed by the program during a train build. In the "Edit Location"
     window under tools, select "Show Track Moves". To change the move count for a track, double
     click on the "Moves" value in the table and enter a positive or negative number. Tracks with
     the least number of "Moves" are processed first.</li>

        <h5>Signal Systems</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated B&amp;O 2009 signal definitions to fix restricted aspect in some cases
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1574">#1574</a>)</li>
                <li>Fixed a problem occurring when a signal system references icons
                    in the local preferences directory.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Signal Mast Drivers</h5>

                <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/1548">been improved</a>.
                It provides much more flexibility for adding extra .jar files and setting options.
                The algorithm for how much memory the program uses has also been improved.</a>
            <li>Egbert Broerse updated the French translation.</li>
            <li>Added startup action to allow a pause for up to five minutes in processing startup items.
