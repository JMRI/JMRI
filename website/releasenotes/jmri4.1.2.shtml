      Release Notes for JMRI 4.1.2 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: September 18, 2015</p>
	<p>From: Matthew Harris</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 4.1.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>-->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2015.</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at release time.

<!--
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.1.3.shtml">JMRI 4.1.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan requires signed drivers for USB adapters. If you've upgraded
from an earlier version, your drivers may not work.  That will cause JMRI to throw errors
when it doesn't find communications links.  To fix this, go to the web site for your 
adapter manufacturer, find the drivers that are listed to work with Mac OS X 10.9 or later, 
download, and install, then retry JMRI again.

<!-- retain through 4.2 -->
<p>Jython has been upgraded to version 2.7.0 with the following potentially breaking changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The decodeJmriFilename() function is no longer available by default. Use the  FileUtil.getExternalFilename() method instead.</li>
  <li>The simple propertyListener object is no longer available by default. Create your own, following the examples provided in the jython folder in the JMRI distribution.</li>
  <li>jmri_defaults.py included in the JMRI distribution is no longer executed by default, but will be executed before any other Jython scipts if included in your User Files location.</li>
  <li>The default behavior of python.cachedir.skip is now true. If using a custom python.properties file, include "python.cachedir.skip=false" in that file.</li>
  <li>As supplied, the 'MakeOriginalDecoderPro.py' script no longer functions as a result of this change. This is fixed in <a href="jmri4.1.3.shtml">JMRI 4.1.3</a>.</li>
  <li>Scripts larger than 100,000 characters cannot be run. This is fixed in JMRI 4.1.3</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.0.shtml">JMRI 4.0 release note</a> for warnings predating the 4.1 development series.

<p>Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  Definitions
    included with this release have been converted to the new form.
    If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
    validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
    Please ask on the JMRI Users group
    for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.

<!--<p>The OpenLCB 0.6.4 library in this version has a bug in its alias
    calculations which prevents JMRI from communicating occasionally.
    A patch has been submitted to the OpenLCB group.
    In the meantime, the workaround is to restart JMRI and/or the node
    and try again; that might allocate different alias values.

<h3>Changes since test release 4.1.1:</h3>

    <h4>Hardware Support</h4>

        <p></p>
<!--
        <h5>C/MRI</h5>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
-->
        <h5>JMRI Simple Server/JMRI Client</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed bugs in both the JMRI Simple Server and JMRI Client
                    that prevented reporter information from being passed from
                    the server to the client.</li>
                <li>Fixed bugs in both the JMRI Simple Server and the JMRI
                    Client that caused the server crash when a lower case
                    letter was used in the transmitted prefix.</li>
                <li>Make client attempt to reconnect if the connection is
                    closed unexpectedly.</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>LocoNet</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>More work on the LN SV2 programming protocol.
                    Please see the
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Addressing.shtml#SVs">documentation page</a>.
                    It's basically ready for people to
                    start defining board definition files.
                    A basic definition is available
                    under "Public Domain and DIY" decoders, then
                    "LNSV2-using boards".</li>
                <li>LocoNet Monitor now decodes LN SV2 programming protocol messages.</li>
                <li>A programmer mode for the original LocoIO boards,
                    which use the LN SV1 programming protocol,
                    is <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Addressing.shtml#SVs">also available</a>.
                    A basic DecoderPro decoder definition is available
                    under "Public Domain and DIY" decoders, then
                    "Hans De Loof LocoIO".</li>
                <li>You can now configure a connection to a
                    <a href="http://www.mollehem.se/index.php/electronics/smartphoninterface-detail">Bluetooth LocoBridge adapter</a>
                    in the Digitrax connection preferences.</li>

            </ul>

		<h5>NCE</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Dave Heap added display of USB &amp; Serial computer cab context pages to the NCE Cabs Monitor.</li>
			</ul>

		<h5>OpenLCB</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The OpenLCB support library has been updated to version 0.6.5</li>
			</ul>

        <h5>RFID</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Network connections to RFID readers are now possible.  Each connection
                    configured into JMRI can talk to a single RFID reader, or to multiple ones
                    through a MERG-style concentrator or equivalent.  JMRI can have
                    as many RFID readers connected via network connections as desired.</li>
                <li>Oscar A. Pruitt provided the implementation to support RFID readers using the EM-18 protocol</li>
            </ul>
<!--
        <h5>Uhlenbrock Intellibox</h5>
            <ul>

    <h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>

        <h5>ESU</h5>
        <p>Dave Heap made the following changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preliminary support for ESU LokSound Select L.</li>
        </ul>

<!--        <h5>MERG</h5>

		<h5>MTH</h5>
			<ul>
             <li></li>
			</ul>

        <h5>QSI</h5>
             <ul> -->
<!--
             <li>All QSI decoder definitions have been converted to the
             modern format of their internal variables from the older
             "ivariable" form.
 -->
<!--             </ul>

        <h5>RR-CirKits</h5>
             <ul>

        <h5>SoundTraxx</h5>
             <ul>
	             <li>
	             	Updated the Econami Steam to use a separate SoundPane to warn about
	             	the issue with the chuff and 'original' Econami decoders.
	             	The value range now supports 0-255, but 'original' Econami decoders
	             	will go silent if value is >127.
	             	Soundtraxx will reprogram the decoder to allow the new range.
	             </li>
             </ul>

   <h4>Operations</h4>
   <ul>

     train's route.</li>
