      Release Notes for JMRI 3.2 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: December 16, 2012</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Production version 3.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

We are very pleased to announce that the 3.1 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production version 3.2" available for download today.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/copyright.shtml">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

This release requires Java 1.6.

<p>
To allow use of UTF-8 characters (special characters with accents, Japanese text, etc) in XML
files, particularly decoder definitions, the default file encoding has been changed to UTF-8.
This requires a change to the startup scripts distributed with JMRI.
If you're just using the JMRI-provided startup tools, you should be all set.
This was done in JMRI 3.1.7, so if you installed that, you're OK now.
If you're using your own custom startup scripts, 
you need to add a "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" option to them. 
If you have any problems with special characters in your existing files, 
please let us know as soon as possible.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

This release has a problem with MS100 mode.  If you have an MS100 working
with an earlier release, please stay with that until a fix is announced in 
some later release.

<h3>Changes since production release 3.0</h3>

<p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Improved how cars are forwarded to alternate tracks. Now if the alternate track's spur
     becomes available during the build, cars originally sent to the alternate are now redirected to
     the spur.</li>
    <li>Made some minor improvements to the train build reports when a train departs or enters
     staging.</li>
    <li>Improved how the csv manifest counts empty cars with custom loads.</li>
    <li>New operations feature, you can now control if arrival or departure times are shown on
     your train manifests. See under "Edit Train"-&gt;Tools-&gt;Options</li>
    <li>You can now open a csv manifest directly from the trains window.</li>
    <li>When building a train, the move list is no longer in alphabetical order.</li>
    <li>You can now force a car or locomotive to any track when using the "Set" window.</li>
    <li>You can now reset the move counts for cars and locos. See under Tools-&gt;Roster in the
     Cars and Locomotives window.</li>
    <li>Train, car, and locomotive log files are now only created when there's data to save.
     This should eliminate empty log files.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where all cars in a kernel were being checked when selecting a track from
     staging. Only the lead car in the kernel should have been checked.</li>
    <li>The train log now includes the build failure messages</li>
    <li>You can now have your manifest show the departure time rather than the estimated
     arrival time. See Print Options for more information</li>
    <li>The schedules window status has been improved to show more cases where a schedule has a
     problem.</li>
    <li>The edit train window will now only launch one edit route window</li>
    <li>Train reset in the Trains window now checks to see if the departure staging track was
     allocated to another in bound train. This prevents using reset for the departure train, and
     then ending up with two trains on the same staging track.</li>
    <li>You can now allow cars to return to staging by train. The train has to be a turn, it
     must depart and return to the same staging location. The option can be found under Edit Train
     -&gt; Tools, Train Build Options.</li>
    <li>New feature "Show Cars in Train" can be found under Tools in the Conductor window or
     from the train icon menu. Now you can see which cars are in the train at the various locations,
     and where picked up cars are to be placed in the train.</li>
    <li>New feature for trains, you can now prevent local moves even when using custom loads.
     You can also prevent through traffic from origin to terminal. See under Edit Train, Tools,
     Train Build Options.</li>
    <li>Now when you select a car type in the location window, the program will bring up the
     "Modify location by car type" window. Now you can quickly see which tracks will service the car
     type selected.</li>
    <li>Removed switch list and build report options from the Print Options window. Build
     report options now have their own window. Switch list options were moved the switch list window
     that is launched by the "Switch List" button in the Trains window.
    <li>Increased the number of fonts available for operations. Only monospaced fonts are now
     available if you've selected tabular manifests and switch lists.</li>
    <li>Improved the train build reports. Now the build report separates each car being
     processed by a line break in very detailed mode.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem with selecting the "Courier" font that was introduced in 3.1.5.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem with the Switch List window not appearing when the default printer
     wasn't specified on the PC. We only know of one user that has experienced this problem, might
     be related to one of the newer versions of JAVA.</li>
    <li>Additional improvements to the train build report, a better description of location
     moves.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>Gregory Madsen made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Improvements to the Backup capabilities, including separate stores for "automatic" and "default" backups, 
   dialog to select between automatic and regular backups when restoring, and a dialog to allow deleting automatic backups.</li>
   </ul>

   Kevin Dickerson made the following changes<br>
<ul>
    <li>Hardware Support<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Added in initial support for the <b>M%auml;rklin Command Station 2</b> System with help from Jean-Francois</li>
        <li>ESU ECOS - Only update the throttle speed on the reply of the last throttle message which has been sent and ignore the event messages until all set speed messages have been processed, otherwise the throttle speed value jumps up and down like a yoyo until the last message is proceed.</li>
        <li>ESU ECOS - Update the loco import to blank out disabled functions and set non-descript function labels to be Fx.</li>
        <li>ESU ECOS - Update some of the back end code relating to the Ecos loco database</li>
        <li>ESU ECOS - Update throttle code to allow 14/28/128 speed steps</li>
        <li>ESU ECOS - Update some of the back end code relating to the turnout and throttle control</li>
        <li>ESU ECOS added support for multi-protocol throttle</li>
        <li>NCE USB - Updated the throttle so that speed step 1 (as shown in the GUI) actually sets the loco speed.</li>
        <li>Updated the backend of the Connection Configuration to remove some limitations on the numbers of settings per connection</li>
        <li>Tweaked some of the GUI settings relating to the connection details</li>

        <li>Decoder Selection Tree - Decoder family groups are now kept together within the Manufacturer list</li>
        <li>Programming - Fix an issue whereby the code doesn't wait for a reply to a programming command and other messages are sent/processed.  This happens if no message is required to put the command station into programming mode.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Throttles<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Provide support for systems that can handle multi-protocols for throttle control and extend this to cover decoders and roster entries.  Additional supported protocols now include
        <ul>
        <li>Motorola</li>
        <li>Selectrix</li>
        <li>MFX</li>

    </ul></li>
    <li>Auto Dispatcher<br>
    <ul>
        <li>If a train has been created using a roster entry, the roster entry is now passed to the throttle manager rather than just the address, this allows use 
            roster entries and systems that support multiple protocols, it also allows the use of the loco to be recorded in the roster entry</li>
        <li>Fix a couple of Index Out Of Bounds Exceptions</li>

      <li>added the binaries needed by the Raspbian hard-float distro (for the Raspberry Pi).</li>
    </ul>  

  <p>Stephen Lowens:
  <ul>
    <li>updated decoder definitions for Digitrax sound/motor decoders. This version adds CV144 (Dynamic brake volume) and moves Con-cor Zephyr definitions to new file
    <li>provided decoder definitions for Con-cor MP54 and Zephyr models. These use Digitrax SDH164D and/or SDN144PS with unique programming and/or sound projects.
  </ul>
  
<p>D Heap:<blockquote>
LokSound V4.0 Decoder CV249 (Min Steam Chuff Distance) was inadvertently assigned to CV248 instead of CV249.

Also some others I wanted were missing, so I added CVs 47,48,51,122,123,129,130,133,250,255, which were the ones missing but present in LokProgrammer 4.3.3 and present in LokSound V4.0 Instruction manual 4. Edition, May 2012 from firmware 4.6.
CV131 appears to be obsolete but I did not remove it.

Had to move a few option numbers up and down to fit all on to existing panes.  
</blockquote>

<p>
John Crellin updated several MRC decoders and provided a new definition for the MRC 1905.

<p>Pete Cressman made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>TextLabels, LocoIcons, SensorIcons in text display mode, MemoryDisplayIcons can be rotated to any angle along with any margin or border decorations they have.</li>
    <li>LocoIcons may have a "docking location" specified.</li>

    <li>add a web page for drawing panels in the browser (supports only limited number of elements now)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Several additional features have been added to the OpenLCB support, including:
<ul>
<li>an updated node browser that directly lets you configure boards
<li>improvements to the specific configuration tools
<li>added a built-in hub for Internet access to your OpenLCB. Start the hub
from the OpenLCB menu or a startup item, the connect your iPhone via port 12021.
<li>support in JMRI throttles for access to an OpenLCB command station
<li>the OpenLCB monitor now shows formatted messages.
<li>If you define a sensor for OpenLCB using just one event, it will work in a momentary fashion.
</ul>

<p>Mike Mosher:
<ul>
<li>contributed a decoder definition for the MTH Expanded DCC decoder.
<li>did a major update to the QSI Version 8 decoder definitions
<li>updated the ESU LokSound Select decoder definitions, and the SoundTraxx MC IMRC and Genesis decoder definitions.

to add the GN1000 series and EMD 645 (non_turbo)


<p>Clint Taylor improved the LocoNet slot monitor. 
<ul>
<li>added code to allow function buttons to work within the Loconet Slot Monitor.
<li>Loconet Slot monitor will refresh if cmd station ops sw 36, 37, 38, or 39 is set to closed 'c'. This is Feature Request 1876188 which specifically asked for Ops SW 36, but there is no reason to limit to sw 36, since 39 will erase all slots memory.
<li>The Loconet Slot monitor function Key were active for System Slots. This could have caused Command Station configuration issues. As a result of this change Function Keys F1-F8, E Stop button, and Free button will not longer work for the reserved system slots which are above slot 120.
</ul>

<p>Steve Todd made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>fixed issue with xmlio server which was preventing multiple clients from getting updates.</li>

    <li>corrected outdated help regarding JMRI Web Server and added details of new and modified components.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bob Bucklew contributed a set of six wider lever icons that use the same graphic but are placed on a wider transparent background. 
These are easier to use with touch panels, but also work well with mouse or trackball clicks. 
The larger target is especially useful when used with a 3 position multi sensor icon.
They are available in the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/resources/icons/USS/plate/levers/">/resources/icons/USS/plate/levers/</a> directory.

<p>Robin Becker:
<ul>
<li>contributed a set of code buttons to match Bob Bucklew's wider lever icons.</li>
<li>fixed a nasty, long-standing problem with how various complicated variable definitions in DecoderPro
interacted.  This could, under the right circumstances, cause reading or writing of the decoder to hang permanently.</li>
<li>provided a new Tam Valley Quad Ln decoder definition.</li>
<li>added xxx-blink-web.gif icons with correct frame delays and dimensions for web and panel use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dick Bronson provided signal definitions for the 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/NS-2008/index.shtml">Norfolk Southern Corporation 2008 operating rule book (NORAC)</a>.

<p>Ken Cameron made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>NCE Cab Monitor - Converted to using table format for the cab detail display</li>
</ul>

<p>Pete Cressman made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to draw shapes (rectangles, circles etc) in ControlPanelEditor.  <b>Note:</b> Use Shift key to select for dragging or popup
(expected usage is to overlay panel items).</li>
<li>Added let Warrants run automated trains without them occupying the starting block - thus warrants can be chained dynamically.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Dave Heap improved the ESU LokSoundV4.0 and LokSound Select decoder definitions.

<p>
Nigel Cliffe provided definition files for two Harman DIY decoders.


<p>

<li>Added JSON WebSocket services to the web server</li>
</ul>

<p>Steve Todd made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed Linux startup script to distinguish hard vs. soft float arm libraries.</li>
<li>Added Operations data to json servers (trains, locations, engines, cars).</li>
<li>Initial version of browser-based Operations functions (train list and manifest).</li>
<li>Fixed issue with WiThrottle handling of wildcard multi-throttles (seen with EngineDriver only).</li>
<li>Added signalmast list and monitoring to xmlio server, added memory and signalmast to json servers</li>
<li>Added signalmast aspect image list to /panel servlet</li>
</ul>

<p>Enzo Fortuna provided an full Italian translation.  (There are still a few bits
of English that will require some code changes)

<p>Fixed a problem where CAN interfaces might pick up the wrong protocol name in the preferences.

<p>To allow use of UTF-8 characters (special characters with accents, Japanese text, etc) in XML
files, particularly decoder definitions, the default file encoding has been changed to UTF-8.
This requires a change to the startup scripts distributed with JMRI.
If you're using your own custom startup scripts, you need to add 
a "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" option to them.

<p>
Added RailStars Limited to the list of decoder manufacturers (company has been around for a while,
but the NMRA C&amp;I Department hasn't updated their list in more than 18 months).

<p>
Tighe Kuykendall provided some documentation updates and fixes.

<p>Ken Cameron edited the BN-1989 signal mast set to have required specific aspects and a basic set of aspect mapping.</p>

<p>James Koretsky submitted icon files for the BN-1989 and aspects.</p>

<p>Mark Underwood submitted the following changes to Virtual Sound Decoder</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sound will now follow the locomotive if you use one of the
  following location tracking systems:
  <ul>
    <li>Digitrax Transponding (verified)</li>
    <li>RPS (not verified)</li>
    <li>RFID (not verified)</li>
