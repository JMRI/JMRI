      Release Notes for JMRI 2.5.7 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: June 27, 2009</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.5.7 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<!-- 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>
 -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the seventh, and hopefully last, in a new series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a production release in late June 2009.

It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>Panel Editor users may now change the default icons to be icons of their own choosing.
<li>Fix to a problem saving custom icons in the Panel Editor that was introduced in 2.5.6.
<li>Fix to a problem editing Signal Head definitions from their table.
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>This test release is quite close to what we expect to be in the
next JMRI production release, but you should still backup your JMRI
files before installing it.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None yet)

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

The Panel Editor has been greatly improved, but it might take a little
while for you to get used to it.  If you have trouble figuring out how it
works, please see the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelEditor.shtml">help pages</a>.

<p>
JMRI version 2.5.5 introduced reorganized definitions for 
SoundTraxx Tsunami Diesel definitions.  Several definition files have been
removed, and are replaced by one common file.  
If you haven't modified your Tsunami XML files, you don't have to read
the rest of this paragraph.
If you have modified or replaced the Tsunami definitions in 
the program directory in a previous
copy of JMRI, you should back up the modified files before installing
JMRI 2.5.5. This version removes the old files, so if you have modifications,
you'll have to put them back manually afterwards.  In general, it's better
to put local modifications in the preferences directory, not the program directory,
so you won't have to do this in the future.

<p>
If you're using a MERG CAN-RS or CAN-USB unit to talk to a MERG CBUS, you should
check that your preferences are set properly.

<p>
Starting with version 2.5.3, JMRI uses a new version of the Log4J library, and 
several additional libraries.  If you've written your own
Java code using JMRI, or have your own startup scripts, you
might have to make some changes to adapt to these new libraries.
If you don't get messages about missing or deprecated methods,
you don't have to worry about this.

<p>
The XSLT location was moved back to the web in JMRI 2.5.3.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.2, Logix support has a lot of
new capabilities, but panel files that use these capabilities
can't be read by previous versions of the program. 
Please keep backup copies of your panel files in case you
want to move back to a previous version.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.2, 
there have been extensive changes to the way JMRI installs and starts on Windows.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be affected by this change.

<p>
The downloads are significantly larger due to more text and images
in the help pages, especially the updated manual.

<p>JMRI now requires Java 5 or later. (Java 5 is also called Java 1.5)
If you are using an older version of Java, please
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">upgrade your Java installation</a>.  
To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.1,
the way you drag things in the Layout Editor has changed if you
are using a Linux computer.
