      Release Notes for JMRI 2.3.4 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: October 8, 2008</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.3.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fourth in a series of test versions.

<p>JMRI 2.3.4 was released to fix a Windows-related problem in JMRI 2.3.3,
which it replaces.  The JMRI 2.3.3 features are listed in its
<a href="jmri2.3.3.shtml">release note</a>.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.3 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.4" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>


<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

Starting with this test release, by default JMRI is allowed to use
up to 200MB of memory (up from a limit of 60MB or 64MB previously).
If this is more memory than you have available, and you notice JMRI
slowing down a lot, please let us know.
<p>
Staring with this test release, JMRI now builds the classpath (the
list of .jar libraries used by the program) dynamically.  
We'll use this in the future for plug-ins and other features, and
other platforms have been doing this for a while.
If you have added any .jar files to your JMRI program directory, they
may cause problems when the program is starting.  Also, if originally
installed a very old version of JMRI, there might still be files around
that can cause this problems.
If so, you can fix it by moving aside those extra
.jar files from the JMRI program directory.
For more information on this, please see this
<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/conversations/topics/35065">discussion</a>
on the JMRI Users group.

<p>JMRI is moving toward requiring Java 1.5 or later.  Certain new features may not work if you are using an earlier
version of Java.  To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts. This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. 
We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts. 
Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and if so a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.
