                <p>The JMRI project is building tools for model railroad computer control.
                We want it to be usable to as many people as possible,
                so we're building it in Java to run anywhere,
                and we're trying to make it independent of specific hardware systems.</p>
                <p>JMRI is intended as a jumping-off point for hobbyists
                who want to control their layouts with a computer
                without having to create an entire system from scratch.</p>

                <p>You can manage your locomotive rosters and easily program your decoders using

                <p>You can build control panels and control your layout using

                    The Raspberry Pi is becoming increasingly popular as a small and cheap computer.
                    JMRI will operate under the Raspbian operating system (Debian version of Linux).
                    Follow the <a href="./install/Raspbian.shtml">installation instructions.</a>.

                    JMRI is an informal open-source software group.
                    We do this for the joy of model railroading, and don't produce anything for profit.
                    <p>
                    One of our members has spent four years in the Federal Courts
                    <a href="/k/summary.shtml">defending our right to continue</a>
                    against an individual who has attacked us with
                    bogus patent threats, cybersquatting, copyright infringement and other illegal acts.

                    <p>
                    We are extremely pleased to announce that this case has been
                    <a href="/k/Recent.shtml#2010-02-17">settled</a>.
                    The agreement ends the dispute, and gives everybody involved a way to move forward.
                    This is a victory for JMRI and open-source software in general.
