      JMRI Install Guide: MacOS Classic (8.x, 9.x)
      </h1>

 <p><strong>Note: These directions are for installing JMRI 1.4/1.6 on MacOS Classic.<br>
 If you want to install JMRI on OS X, please see
 the <a href="MacOSX.shtml">current OS X Install instructions</a>.</strong></p>
 
      <ol>
        <li><a name="sysreq"></a>Determine if your hardware supports Java and JMRI</li>
      
        <p>Minimum hardware specification for JMRI versions up to 1.4:
	        <ul>
	        <li>A Macintosh with a Power PC processor running OS8.1
	        <li>At least 32&nbsp;MB of memory
	        <li>At least 8&nbsp;MB of disk space available
	        </ul>
         A faster CPU, later OS version and more memory are recommended. A screen size of 800x600 or larger is strongly recommended.
         
        <p>Minimum hardware specification for JMRI versions 1.6 and later:
	        <ul>
	        <li>Any Macintosh with a PCI bus and a PPC603e processor or better 
	        <li>A minimum of 64&nbsp;MB of RAM (96&nbsp;MB or greater is recommended)
	        <li>A minimum screen size of 800x600
	        </ul>
        OS8.6 or OS9.1 are recommended.
        <p>        
	<li>Get and install Java (if needed)</li>

	<p>JMRI 1.6 should run with the concurrent release of the
	Macintosh Runtime for Java (MRJ). MRJ requires Mac OS 8.1 or later.
	If you don't have Java installed on your Macintosh, or even if
	you're not sure, download the installer from Apple at
	<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=75097">
	http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=75097</a> and run it.</p>

	<p>You need to have the Java Swing and Java communications libraries
	installed. An installer can be downloaded from
	<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JavaLibsInstaller-2.hqx?download">
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JavaLibsInstaller-2.hqx?download</a>.
	Unfortunately, it's a 4&nbsp;MB download. You only have to do it once,
	however; future updates of JMRI (up to 2.9) will continue to use these
	same libraries.</p>

	<p>Be sure to run both of these installers before installing
	DecoderPro.</p>

	<p>Note that you will have to reinstall these if you have to
	reinstall the system software, or if you do a "clean install" of an
	OS update. </p>

	<li>Get JMRI</li>

	<p>Download a version of JMRI.  If you're on this install page,
	then that version should be
	<a href="../releasenotes/jmri1.6.1.html">JMRI release 1.6.1</a> or earlier.
	As the version numbers change with every release, 
	<a href="../download/index.shtml">this link</a>
	takes you to the general JMRI download page, where you can
	select whichever version you like.</p>

	<p>The JMRI project is continuously adding features, bug fixes,
	examples and tutorials to the release, and so new "test" versions
	appear every couple of weeks.  You may find one of these has features
	that you really want.  These are announced in the "JMRI users" Groups.io
	discussion group at
	<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">https://groups.io/g/jmriusers</a>.
	</p>

	<li>Install JMRI</li>

	<p>To install, you just have to move the JMRI folder to where you
	want it on your computer.</p>

	<li>Connect your computer system to your Command Station hardware</li>
	<p>Generally, older Macs use a style of serial connector called
	"Mini-DIN-8".  It looks similar to, but identical to, the ADB connectors
	used to connect keyboards and mice.  You'll need an adapter that 
	adapts that connector to the connector on your particular DCC system.
	<p>More information on the wiring in these connectors
	is available on the <a href="/help/en/html/hardware/MacintoshSerialPorts.shtml">Mini-DIN-8 Help page</a>.
	<p>If your computer doesn't have serial ports, see our page on 
	<a href="/help/en/html/hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB adapters</a>
	for more information.
	<p>
	You may also need to configure the Macintosh to allow the program
	to use the serial port, instead of the Mac using it for a printer
	or LocalTalk connection.  For more information on doing that, 
	see the 
	<a href="MacOSOldSerial.shtml">Serial Port Configuration</a> page.

	<li> Installation is complete.</li>
	<p>
	Once those packages are installed, you can run the program by
	double-clicking on the "DecoderPro", "PanelPro" or
	"JmriDemo" application icon in the JMRI folder.
