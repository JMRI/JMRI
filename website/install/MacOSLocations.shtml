<h1>JMRI: File Locations on Mac OS X</h1>

NOTE: Since the Mac Finder does not usually display the location of a file using 
a filepath, reference in this document to a file path such as "/Applications/JMRI/" 
means the folder "JMRI", in the folder "Applications" on the Mac startup disk.

<p>
During installation the JMRI program files can be copied to any folder 
on a Mac hard disk. 
A folder named "JMRI" in the "Applications" folder on the Mac startup 
disk has been used as its location in these examples.

<p>
When you click the DecoderPro icon in the "/Applications/JMRI/" folder, 
it starts the Mac OS X application bundle DecoderPro.app which puts together the things 
needed to run the JMRI program.
"/Applications/JMRI/" is where JMRI finds all the files from the original download. 

<p>
"[Username]" is the user name you use to log on to the Mac when running JMRI.

<p>
The first time you open JMRI, it has you fill in the preferences info
and then it stores it in the file 
"/Users/[Username]/Library/Preferences/JMRI/DecoderProConfig2.xml" 
so it's there the next time you open JMRI. 
"/Users/[Username]/Library/Preferences/JMRI/"
is where by default the JMRI program stores all the information
that's specific to your particular setup.

<p>
When you read a decoder on the programming track and save the file,
JMRI saves the file to the folder
"/Users/[Username]/Library/Preferences/JMRI/roster/".
JMRI also adds the ID of that file to a list in
"/Users/[Username]/Library/Preferences/JMRI/roster/roster.xml". 

<p>
When you build and store a panel it is also stored by default in
"/Users/[Username]/Library/Preferences/JMRI/".  
This allows the JMRI files in the folder "/Applications/JMRI/"
to be updated without overwriting your files.

<p>
Each program in the suite of JMRI can store files for itself in various locations. 
JMRI provides a facility to allow you to verify where the various files are stored.  
On the 'Help' menu, choose the option 'Locations...'.
This will then open a window displaying the main locations for files, for example:
<pre>
Preferences directory: /Users/[Username]/Library/Preferences/JMRI/ 
Program directory: /Applications/JMRI/
</pre>
