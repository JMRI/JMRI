<h1>Installing JMRI on Asus EeePC</h1>

This procedure outlines the steps taken to install the JMRI suite on an Asus EeePC.

<p>
The Asus EeePC is a flash-based device running a customized version of 
Linux (based on Xandros). 
As a result, the majority of the installation steps are similar to that 
when installing on any other (recent) Linux distribution. 
It is also important to remember that, unlike MS Windows, 
Linux commands and filenames are case-sensitive (i.e. the filename 'DecoderPro' 
is not the same as the filename 'decoderpro').

<p>
This has been tested on a UK-spec EeePC in conjunction with a KeySpan USB-Serial adapter.

<p>
Layout connection tested with a Serial SPROG.

<p>
Note: It is the understanding of the Author that the 2G models of the EeePC 
do not come with a suitable Java Runtime Environment installed.


<h2>Installation procedure</h2>

<h4>Download necessary files</h4>

Firstly, the JMRI suite should be downloaded and saved into 'My Documents'. 
(For version 2.0, the filename is JMRI.2.0.tgz - substitute the appropriate 
filename for other versions).

<p>
Also, the files 
<a href="eeepc/rxtx.tgz">rxtx.tgz</a> and 
<a href="eeepc/easymodeicons.tgz">easymodeicons.tgz</a>
should be downloaded and 
saved into 'My Documents'.

<p>
When entering some of the commands listed below, it is necessary to refer 
to the 'My Documents' directory. 
To allow for the space in the pathname, this is written as My\ Documents. On 
an EeePC with a UK English keyboard, the \ character is entered by the 
key combination Fn+Z.


<h4>Open Terminal and assign super-user (root) permissions</h4>

In order to install the JMRI suite, you require root permissions. 
By default, this is not the case.

<p>
Open a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T)

<P>
In this window, at the prompt '/home/user&gt; ' type 'sudo su' (without the quotes)

<p>
This will now change this terminal session to one with root 
permissions - BE VERY CAREFUL - any commands typed into this window will 
now be running with full root permissions.

<p>
This terminal window should remain open throughout the installation procedure.

<h4>Install the software</h4>

<p>
To start, it is necessary to install the communications libraries by typing the following commands:

<code class="block">
  cd /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.10/jre
  tar -zxvvf /home/user/My\ Documents/rxtx.tgz
  cd lib/i386
  ln -s librxtxSerial-2.0.7pre2.so librxtxSerial.so
  ln -s librxtxParallel-2.0.7pre2.so librxtxParallel.so
</code>

Second step is to install the JMRI suite by typing the following commands:

<code class="block">
  cd /usr/local
  tar -zxvvf /home/user/My\ Documents/JMRI.2.0.tgz
  chown -R root:root /usr/local/JMRI
  chmod -R 755 /usr/local/JMRI
</code>

<h4>Modify the start-up scripts</h4>

Due to installing the JMRI suite as a user program, 
it is necessary to modify the start-up scripts.

<p>
Change directory to the install directory by typing the following command:

<code class="block">
  cd JMRI
</code>

Modify start-up scripts to allow execution from the install directory using the command:

<code class="block">
  nano DecoderPro
</code>

This will now start-up a text editor in the terminal window.

<p>
Using the cursor keys, find the line that reads:

<code class="block">
#   cd /usr/local/JMRI
</code>

Modify the line by removing the leading # (it should then read):

<code class="block">
   cd /usr/local/JMRI
</code>

Press Ctrl+O and then Enter to write-out the file.
Press Ctrl+X to exit

<p>
Repeat this modification for:

<code class="block">
  PanelPro
</code>

and optionally for:

<code class="block">
  JmriDemo
</code>

This completes the necessary start-up file modifications.

<h4>Create EasyLauncher icons</h4>

Install the icons for the AsusLauncher menu:

<code class="block">
  cd /opt/xandros/share/AsusLauncher
  tar -zxvvf /home/user/My\ Documents/easymodeicons.tgz
</code>

<h4>Exit administrator shell</h4>

To finalise the modifications to the AsusLauncher menu, it is necessary to leave the administrator shell by typing the following command:

<code class="block">
  exit
</code>

This will result in the prompt changing to '/home/user> '.

<h4>Modify AsusLauncher menu</h4>

Before modifying the AsusLauncher menu, it needs to be determined if a user copy of the configuration exists.

<p>
This verification is achieved using the following commands:

<code class="block">
  cd .AsusLauncher
  ls simpleui.rc
</code>

If there is an error 'ls: simpleui.rc: No such file or directory', it is necessary to perform the following steps. Otherwise, skip the section 'Copy default AsusLauncher file'.

<h4>Copy default AsusLauncher file</h4>

If there is no file 'simpleui.rc' in the '/home/user/.AsusLauncher' directory, it is necessary to copy the default AsusLauncher file.

<p>
This is achieved by using the following command:

<code class="block">
  cp /opt/xandros/share/AsusLauncher/simpleui.rc simpleui.rc
</code>

Confirm that the file 'simpleui.rc' exists by typing:

<code class="block">
  ls simpleui.rc
</code>

This should then display:

<code class="block">
  simpleui.rc
</code>

<h4>Make the AsusLauncher modifications</h4>

Now that it has been determined that a user copy of the AsusLauncher configuration exists,
it is necessary to modify this configuration.

<p>
This is achieved by entering the following command:

<code class="block">
  nano simpleui.rc
</code>

Scroll down to the end of the file. This should be a single line showing:

<code class="block">
  &lt;/simpleui&gt;
</code>

Insert the following lines before the last line (copy and paste from here, or the
<a href="eeepc/launcheritems.txt">launcheritems.txt</a> file):

<code class="block">
  &lt;parcel extraargs="/usr/bin/xterm -hold -e /usr/local/JMRI/DecoderPro"
          icon="decoderpro_norm.png"
          selected_icon="decoderpro_hi.png"
          simplecat="Play"&gt;
          &lt;name lang="en"&gt;Decoder Pro&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/parcel&gt;

  &lt;parcel extraargs="/usr/bin/xterm -hold -e /usr/local/JMRI/PanelPro"
          icon="panelpro_norm.png"
          selected_icon="panelpro_hi.png"
          simplecat="Play"&gt;
          &lt;name lang="en"&gt;Panel Pro&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/parcel&gt;
</code>

Press Ctrl+O and then Enter to write-out the file.
Press Ctrl+X to exit

<p>
Note: the new icons will not show until after the EeePC has been restarted. 


<h4>Complete the installation</h4>

Close the terminal window by typing the following command:

<code class="block">
  exit
</code>

Now, restart the EeePC by your preferred method.

<p>
Once restarted, icons for Decoder Pro and Panel Pro should exist on the Play tab.

<h4>Issues</h4>

<ol>
<li>Certain dialog boxes are too large to display on screen - use Alt and drag with mouse to see everything.
<li>Some Asus updates will cause the icons to be removed. In that case, redo the 'Modify AsusLauncher menu' steps.
</ol>
