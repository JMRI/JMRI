<h1> 
JMRI on Windows: "The JAVA SE Platform binary has stopped working" error
</h1>

This page discusses what to do when your Windows machine displays a 
"The JAVA SE Platform binary has stopped working" error
message when starting JMRI.

<p>
This seems to happen only on Windows, and only in particular situations.
We don't understand exactly when.
<p>
(Should we add more info here on which Windows versions, etc.?  
Does that matter if somebody has hit the error)
<p>
The problem seems to involve the USB connection to 
layout hardware.

	<ol>
	<li>If you have your layout connected through USB,
	try connecting via a powered hub.
	<li>If you're already using a powered hub, try connecting
	directly to the computer. 
	</ol>

You may have to reset Preferences after each change of the wiring.

<h2>Digitrax PR3</h2>
<p>
It has been found that this issue is seen when using certain Digitrax PR3
interfaces in conjunction with 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows.
<p>
This appears to be related to a firmware issue on earlier models of the PR3
interface. Digitrax have issued an updated version of the firmware that can
be installed onto the PR3 interface.
<p>
The firmware can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.digitrax.com/downloads/pr3-firmware/">Digitrax website</a>.
