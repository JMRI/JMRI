   <h1>JMRI Install Guide: Mac OS X</h1>
 
      <h2>New Comm Library for Mac OS X</h2>

<p>This page describes how to install a new version of the Java
communications library for JMRI.  This is <em>experimental</em>
and we would greatly appreciate your feedback. Currently (Spring 2006),
we recommend this for users connecting to Lenz systems (LI100, LI101, etc),
for those having certain types of problems with USB to serial adapters,
and everybody who has an Intel-powered Mac.</p>
<p>
This is unfortunately a long, detailed process. Once we're sure
it's actually working, we hope to find somebody to build an installer
that does all of this automagically.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>If you have installed the old version of the
    program, you have to remove it manually.
    <br>
    These steps only undo the actions of installer you used earlier to
    install these libraries; they should have no other effect on
    your system.
    <br>
    To do this, open the Terminal application (from 
    the Utilities folder in the Applications folder)
    and in the resulting window type the lines (you will probably
    be prompted for an administrator password):<br>
    <div class="wide">
        <code class="block">
        sudo rm /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/lib/ext/comm.jar
        sudo rm /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.3.1/Home/lib/javax.comm.properties
        sudo rm /usr/lib/java/libSerial.jnilib
        </code>
    </div>
        You might get a message about "No such file or directory"; that can be ignored.</li>

	<li>Install the new Java serial communications library<br>
     Download the new library archive from
	 <a
	 href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/comm.jar?download">
	 http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/comm.jar?download</a>.<br>
	
	You now have to copy it from the directory to which it was
	downloaded to it's correct location. To do this:
	<ol>
		<li>Drag the downloaded comm.jar file to the Desktop so we can find it</li>
		<li>Open a Terminal window (see above) and type:<br>
		<code class="block">
	sudo cp ~/Desktop/comm.jar /Library/Java/Extensions/
		</code>
		</li>
    </ol>
	</li>
    
    <li>Install the new RXTX libraries.<br>
     Download the new library archive from
	 <a
	 href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/RXTX_Jag_4.pkg.sit.hqx?download">
	 http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/RXTX_Jag_4.pkg.sit.hqx?download</a>.
	 <br>
	 Unpack and run that installer.  It might mention 
	 various things that you have to check about the "uucp group" and
	 similar.  You can just ignore those, as they're being handled 
	 by the installer and the previous steps.
	 <br>
	 When the installer is complete, restart your computer.
	</li>
</ol>
	 <p>
	 At this point, you should be able to start any of the JMRI
	 applications (or other Java programs) and communicate
	 via serial ports.  Please 
	 <a href="mailto:jmri.@jmri.net">send feedback</a> 
	 to let us know whether it worked or not!</p>
