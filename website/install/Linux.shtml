      This page describes general aspects of installing JMRI on Linux.

      <p>
      There are multiple versions of Linux, all slightly different and
      requiring installation instructions that differ in detail.
      There are specific pages describing details of
      installation on

				<li><a href="Ubuntu.shtml">Ubuntu</a>

				<li><a href="OpenSUSE.shtml">Open SUSE</a>

	        Some Linux distributions have associated repositories that make it easier to
	        install software.  If you have one of those, you can find more info at:
	            <ul>

			The general procedure to install JMRI is:

				<ol>
				<li>Determine if your hardware supports Java and JMRI</li>

				<a name="sysreq"></a><h3>JMRI System Requirements</h3>
				<p>Using JMRI requires a combination of hardware (in this case running Linux), Java software and a JMRI download for a specific version.
				<p>JMRI&reg; version 4.2 requires Java 1.8.<br>
				Version 3.10.1 requires Java 1.6 or later.<br>
				Version 2.14.1 requires Java 1.5 (or 1.6 if you wish for drag &amp; drop).<br>
				Version 2.12 requires Java 1.5 or later.
				</p>

				<p>These steps outline how to install DecoderPro on Linux.
				These steps should work for Red Hat 8, 9 and 10. They don't
				work on RedHat 7.</p>

				<p>(For other versions of Linux, please
				see the first item in our
				<a href="FAQLinux.html">JMRI Linux FAQ</a>).

				<p>You'll need the correct serial port or USB port
				to attach to your layout hardware.  JMRI is compatible
				with USB-to-Serial adapters, so long as they have
				Linux drivers that make them look like regular serial ports.
				For troubleshooting, see the
				<a href="FAQLinux.html#usb">FAQ</a></p>

				<li>Get and Install Java (if needed)</li>

				<p>See if you have a version of Java already installed<p>
				<p class="example"> sh> java -version</p>

				<p>If the Java version is 1.8 or later, you may be fine, but
				   be aware that if you did not install Java on your system
				   yourself, some systems have Java only partially installed. They
				   will respond correctly to the above command, but still are not
				   all there. If your system does not have Java in the environment
				   variable PATH, the install is probably not complete. Check with
				   the system manager or do a fresh Java installation.</p>

				<p>If it is not at least 1.8, or if you get a "java: not found"
				error, you will need to install it.</p>

				<p>Most Linux distributions can get an automated install download
				from Oracle by clicking on this button:<br>
				<a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank">
				<img src="https://download.oracle.com/technetwork/java/get-java/getjavasoftware-88x31.png" alt="Get Java Software" border="0" width="88" height="31" />
				</a>

				<p>If that doesn't work or you need to manually install Java,
				    you can find further information on the
				    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"> Oracle Java downloads page</a>.
				    <ul>
				    <li>Java comes in several forms:
				    JMRI needs the Standard Edition (SE) version, but
				    Java EE is also OK;<br>
				    neither Java ME or Java Embedded are sufficient.
				    <li>There are also different Java SE installers: JMRI can
				    run with either a proper SDK (Software Development Kit, for compiling and running Java)
				    or JRE (Java Runtime Environment, for just running Java) installation.
				    <li>
				    Note: JMRI is developed with Java 1.8.  It should work fine with later versions (java 1.9, Java 10, 11, etc)
	                but you may get a message about "WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred" and "WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers".
	                We know about this, and it'll get fixed in due course; you can ignore the messages.
				    </ul>
				</p>

				<li>Give user-level application access to serial ports<br>
				    <p>
				    <tt>chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0</tt><br>
				    <tt>chmod 666 /dev/ttyS1</tt></p>
				    </li>
				<li>
				    <p>Give user access to lock files (required on Red Hat).
				   Edit <code>/etc/group</code> &amp; <code>/etc/gshadow</code> to add user to the 'uucp' and 'lock'
				   groups.</p></li>


				<li>Get JMRI</li>
				    <p><a href="../download/index.shtml#prod-rel">Download</a> a version of JMRI, either the
				    latest production version, or a "test version".  Since the version
				    numbers change with every release, this link takes you to the general
				    JMRI download page, where you can select whichever version you like.</p>

				    <p>The JMRI project is continuously adding features, bug fixes,
				    examples and tutorials to the release, and so a new "test" versions
				    appear every couple of weeks.  You may find one of these has features
				    that you really want.  These are announced in the "JMRI users" Groups.io
				    discussion group at
				    <a
				     href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">https://groups.io/g/jmriusers</a>.
				    </p>

	  	<a id="update"></a>
				<li>Install JMRI</li>
				    <p>Uncompress/untar the file you downloaded above.  This will create a new "JMRI" folder.</p>
				    <p>Note: Each JMRI release is an independent set of files: It's intended to be used as a
				    whole.  Each release provides new files, and sometimes removes old files.
				    You should therefore <em>not</em> expand the download into the same place as an
				    existing JMRI installation.  Instead, expand it into a separate location, and
				    move in to it's final destination, completely replacing any previous version of JMRI.
				    <p>To install, you just have to move that new JMRI folder to where you
				    want it on your computer.</p>

		<a id="startup"></a><h3>Starting JMRI</h3>
				<li>Installation is complete.<br>
				    You can run the program by using
				    the "DecoderPro", "PanelPro", or
				    "JmriDemo" scripts in the JMRI folder.  Change directory there, and
				    invoke a script with e.g. "./DecoderPro"</li>
				</ol>
