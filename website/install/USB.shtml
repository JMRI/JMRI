<h1> 
JMRI Install Guide: USB Components
</h1>

Starting in version 2.1.5, JMRI contains some 
tools for direct access to USB devices.  We built in this support
initially so that we could directly access the 
<a href="../help/en/html/hardware/qsi/index.shtml">QSI Programmer</a>
and certain Insteon
<a href="../help/en/html/hardware/powerline/index.shtml">Powerline</a>
adapters, but hope that it will eventually be generally useful.

<h2>JInput</h2>

Certain types of USB devices can be attached as a "HID device".
(That stands for "Human Interface Device device", but let's not get distracted)
The 
<a href="https://jinput.github.io/jinput/">JInput project</a>
has provided tools for accessing these devices which we can use
to connect HID devices to events within the JMRI programs.

<p>
As a first approach to this, you can find a "USB Input Control"
under the Debug menu in JMRI 2.1.5 and later.
A screen-shot of it is shown
<a href="images/JInputFrame.gif">to the right</a>.
When you open the tool, you'll get a window that lets
you browse the HID devices on your computer, and attach 
them to specific JMRI sensors and memories.  You can
then have Routes, Logix and scripts access that information to
do whatever you'd like with the device inputs.

<p>
For more information, including some info on limitations, 
please see the 
<a href="../help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/jinput/treemodel/TreeFrame.shtml">help page</a>
for the tool.

<h2>LibUSB</h2>

LibUSB (also known as libusb and libUSB) is a powerful, but tough to
use, library for general access to all USB devices, not just HID devices.
We intend to use it in JMRI to access Insteon adapters and other 
devices that have complicated (i.e. powerful) interfaces.
<p>
In JMRI 2.1.5, there's only a "USB Device Viewer" 
browsing tool that we'll be using to
check connections to various USB devices on various types of computers.
By putting this out in the general test release, even if 
it doesn't do anything model-railroad related, it makes it much
easier to test how well this works in various situations.
<p>
Eventually, we'll have more in this section.

<h3>Limitations</h3>
The browsing tool comes directly from libusb, and is coded
to end the application when the window is closed.  The libusb authors
consider this a feature.  Since we don't want to distribute our
own version of the library with that behavior changed, we'll just 
live with it for now.

<h3>Installing LibUSB</h3>

Before you can use LibUSB on your computer, you have to download
and install a library.  The following sections talk about how to
do that.

<h4>Windows XP and later</h4>
Download and install
the 
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/libusb-win32/libusb-win32-filter-bin-0.1.12.1.exe?modtime=1174387137&big_mirror=0">libusb-win32 installer</a>.
This is called the "filter mode driver", and it's the one you want.

<p>
There is currently no version of LibUSB for versions of Windows before XP, 
due to limitations in their USB support.

<h4>Ubuntu Linux</h4>
Start by opening
<p>
System &gt; Administration &gt; Synaptic Package Manager
<p>
and search for "libusb". There are four packages that start with that name;
install them all.

<h4>Mac OS X</h4>

You need to install a library package to use libUSB on Mac OS X.
Click <a href="http://www.ellert.se/twain-sane/">here</a>
for an installer
(you don't need the TWAIN or others, just LibUSB),
or you can download an installer using one of the following direct links.
