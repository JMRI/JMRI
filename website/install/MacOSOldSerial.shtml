      JMRI Install Guide: MacOS Classic Serial Port Configuration
      </h1>

Donn Welton provided this list of steps to get DecoderPro working through the
single serial port on a PowerBook G3 laptop.  Originally, it would not work because
MacOS was retraining ownership of the port and wouldn't release it.

<dl>
<dd>
	<ul>
	<li>The key is the Extensions Manager (which one gets through via Control Panel via Apple 
	Icon).  I turned off all the extensions that were showing in the Chooser, i.e., I turned off all
	printers and then AppleShare.
	
	<li>In that same Extensions Manager I also turned off file sharing, web sharing, remote 
	access, infared, and modem.
	
	<li>In the chooser, I turned off Apple Talk.
	
	<li>Making sure that I had the recent version of Java 2.2.5 and Java Comms library (both 
	partners of OS 9.0), I then reinstalled JMRI and reset the Preferences.
	
	</ul>
Now it is up and running like a dolphin in cool water.  

<p>
A couple more notes:  I purposely left the TCP/IP (but set to Ethernet) and Internet 
extensions active.  My hope is that they will not interfere with the operation of the serial 
port when I link my lap top to two other Apple computers via Apple talk (this will give me 
printing via one of them) and to the internet via my the cable internet connection.   I am 
keen to keep the internet connection active on the G-3 as it will access this site and then 
other downloads.  Still, I am tempted to do a clean sweep of the harddisk and start over as 
this will give me more space and, perhaps, a bit of speed.
