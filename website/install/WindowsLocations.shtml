<h1>JMRI File Locations on Windows</h1>

When a JMRI script such as "C:\Program Files\JMRI\DecoderPro.bat" is started, 
it creates the Java command line needed to start the JMRI program.
In turn, the program looks for information on how the hardware is
set up in the file:
"C:\Documents and Settings\[Username]\JMRI\DecoderProConfig2.xml" or similar. 
(Each application in the JMRI suite stores its information in different file
in that directory).
"[Username]" is the User name you have signed on to Windows during the system start up.

<p>
The first time you open a JMRI application, it has you fill in the info 
on the preference pane and then it stores it so it's there the 
next time you open JMRI.

<p>
When you read a decoder on the programming track and save the information,
JMRI saves the file to the folder
"C:\Documents and Settings\[Username]\JMRI\roster\".  
JMRI also adds that file's ID to a list in "
C:\Documents and Settings\[Username]\JMRI\roster.xml". 

<p>
When you create and store a panel it is also stored in
"C:\Documents and Settings\[Username]\JMRI" by default.  
This allows the JMRI release files at "C:\Program Files\JMRI"
to be updated without over writing your files.

<p>
Each program in the JMRI suite stores files for itself in various locations.
JMRI provides a facility to allow you to verify where various files are stored.
On the 'Help' menu, choose the option 'Locations...'.
This will then  open a window displaying the default
locations for files, for example:
<pre>
Preferences directory: C:\Documents and Settings\[Username]\JMRI\ 
Program directory: C:\Program Files\JMRI 
</pre>
