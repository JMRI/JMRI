  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
  recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. JMRI
  is governed by a small group of maintainers which means not all opened
  issues may receive direct feedback.

# Comment to post when closing a stale issue. Set to `false` to disable
closeComment: >
  This issue has been automatically closed due to lack of activity. In an
  effort to reduce noise, please do not comment any further. Note that the
  maintainers may elect to reopen this issue at a later date if deemed
  necessary.

Optionally, specify configuration settings that are specific to just 'issues' or 'pulls':
