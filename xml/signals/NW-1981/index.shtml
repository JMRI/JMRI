      <h2>N&amp;W 1981 Signal Definitions</h2>
      This directory contains signaling definitions corresponding to the Norfolk and Western 1981
      rule book and applies to color position light, color light, search light, and semaphore
      signals. These definitions cover the former N&amp;W, Virginian, Nickel Plate, Wabash,
      P&amp;WV, and ACY territories.
      <h3>Color Position Light Signals</h3>
      The 2 arm version of the NW CPLs are illustrated using two complete round faces. In the
      field, the actual signal may not have included a complete face depending on the indications
      needed for a given location. In general, a two arm signal would be used at an interlocking or
      as the advance signal for an interlocking. Signal installations at the end of a siding may
      only have a single head. A number plate was drawn on the Rule 291 signal icon to show a stop
      and proceed indication.
      <p>The single arm absolute signals include a single marker for the stop and stay indication.
      I have mapped the single red marker to lunar so that a signal decoder such as the Team
      Digital SHD2 can drive the entire signal off 4 outputs.</p>

      <p>The rule book illustrates two versions of the NW CPL dwarf. Early versions of this style
      dwarf had the arc from 12 to 3-o-clock position. Due to clearnance issues, the arc was change
      to the 9 to 12-o-clock position. I don't know if this changed the aspects the signal could
      display. I am assuming that either version could display the up to 4 aspects. There is a stop
      and proceed version that includes a numbner plate. The left lower red light is mapped to
      lunar based on the later version of the signal.</p>

      <h3>Color Light, Search Light, and Semaphore Signals</h3>

      <p>These signals encompass the all of the non color position light signals. The rule book
      does not really make a distinction between the types of signal heads. The images in the rule
      book are drawn as possible semaphore signals with the exception of the indications which have
      a lunar light. In those rules, separate signal images were drawn without semaphore blades
      showing the lunar aspect.</p>

      <p>I believe the signals with lunar aspects are of Wabash origin. They allow for a complete
      set of aspects with two arms in locations that would typically take three.</p>
