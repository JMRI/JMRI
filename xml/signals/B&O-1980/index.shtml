      <h1>B&amp;O 1980 Signaling Definition</h1>
      This directory contains signaling definitions corresponding to the Chessie System 1980 rule
      book for the B&amp;O RR.
      <p>Chessie System's 1980 rule book listed separate signal rules sections for the three
      component road. Rules 281 through 292 applied to the C&amp;O, B-281 through B-292 applied to
      the B&amp;O, and W-281 through W-292 applied to the Western Maryland.</p>

      <p>The 1980 rules for the B&amp;O lacked a slow clear indication. The slow clear indication
      had been present in the past and would be added back at some point in the following years.
      The former slow clear indication was renamed slow approach slow and allowed for maximum
      authorized speed if enough distance permitted it before approaching the next signal.</p>

      <p>There are 8 types of CPL signals included in this definition. Six mast sets and two
      dwarfs. The icons will display the necessary markers when needed eliminating the need to
      guess which ones are needed. One can create there route in the layout editor and see how the
      physical signals need to be configured before buying parts. Only the NJ International set has
      pre defined markers to match their pre-built #1214 signal.</p>

      <p>Four of the CPL masts have shortblock in their name and are to be used in locations of
      short braking distances. These signals are mapped to protect signals displaying Approach with
      Approach Medium.</p>

      <p>This signal system uses blocks and turnout speed settings for its logic irrespective of
      turnout position. For best results it is recommended you set up your layout in the layout
      editor and create the necessary blocks and assign speeds to them. Recognized speeds are
      Normal, Limited, Medium, Slow, and Restricted. The signal system will use these speeds to
      pick between the possible aspects.</p>

      <p>To use the CPL files you need to set up the signal as three heads. The top 3 markers are
      the first head, the main disk is the second head, then the lower three markers comprise the
      third head. The dwarf signal is set up the same way. The permissive CPLs need two signal
      heads. The top markers makeup the first head and the main disc make up the second head.
      Permissive CPLs will not have lower markers. The NJ International set needs two heads. The
      top center marker is green, the left upper marker is yellow, and the bottom center marker is
      red. The main disc makes up the second head.</p>

      <p>I am not an expert on the B&amp;O semaphore signals. These definitions come straight from
      the rule books and may have been used in conjunction with CPLs. They lack a lot of the
      necessary aspects and indications to be a complete signal system on their own.</p>
