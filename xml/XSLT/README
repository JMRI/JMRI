README for xml/XSLT in the JMRI distribution.

See COPYING for license information.

This contains XSLT transformations of the XML information maintained
by the JMRI project.  build.xml is the ant build control file for
performing these transformations. In general, these transformations put 
their results in "pages" subdirectory that is not present in CVS.

Common & summary Ant targets:

 	xslt		run the whole sequence of processing

	init    	create needed directories
	clean   	remove compilation results to force rebuild
	copyDTD		ensure local DTD file copies present where needed for processing
	copyXML		ensure local XML file copies present where needed for processing
 
Create the by-decoder web pages and index:

	index 		create a decoder index page
 				uses DecoderModelIndex.xsl
 			
	models		tranform definitions into web pages
 				uses DecoderModelList.xsl
 
Create other views as web pages:			

	selection	create HTML decoder selection guide listing various properties
 				uses SelectionGuide.xsl
 	
 	cvsummary	create HTML page listing CVs available on all decoders
  				uses CVsummary.xsl, interestingCVs.xml
 
Create views as CommaSeparateVariable files:

	csv			create CSV file listing CVs available on all decoders
 				uses CSVsummary.xsl, interestingCVs.xml
 			
 				create CSV file listing decoder sizes
 				uses SizeAsCSV.xsl
 				
 				create CSV file listing decoder power limits
 				uses PowerAsCSV.xsl


Information on specific XSLT tranforms:

decoder.xsl     used as a stylesheet by decoder XML files for web display;
                creates an update form
                
DecoderID.xsl   used by Ant "id" target and used as an XML stylesheet to 
                display the decoderIndex.xml file.
                
panelfile.xsl   stylesheet for JMRI panel files

locomotive.xsl  stylesheet for JMRI roster entry files

roster.xsl      stylesheet for JMRI roster index

rpsfile.xsl     stylesheet for JMRI RPS files

throttle.xsl    stylesheet for JMRI throttle layout files

LogixToCode.xml Tool for creating Java code from the Logix and Routes
                in a panel file.  The code will (with a little adjustment)
                recreate the contents.



Processing decoder files:

normalizeDecoder is a shell script that runs the standard series of processings
on an set of input files, followed by xmllint to put it in standard layout.


decoderLabelToItem.xsl     - if the item attribute is missing, create it from the
                            label attribute

decoderAddLabelElement.xsl - adds a label element from the label or item attribute
                             so that the label attribute can later be removed

decoderSuppressRedundantLabel.xsl - removes the label attribute when a label element is
                                    is present

decoderAddI18nLabel.xsl         - adds <label xml:lang=".."> elements for a specific language
                                  that has to be editted into the top of the file

decoderAddI18nTooltip.xsl       - adds <tooltip xml:lang=".."> elements for a specific language
                                  that has to be editted into the top of the file

decoderAddI18nComment.xsl       - adds <comment xml:lang=".."> elements for a specific language
                                  that has to be editted into the top of the file

decoderAddI18nChoice.xsl        - adds <comment xml:lang=".."> elements for a specific language
                                  that has to be editted into the top of the file

decoderAddI18nName.xsl          - adds <comment xml:lang=".."> elements for a specific language
                                  that has to be editted into the top of the file


Still needed:

*) decoderAddI18nLabel.xsl needs to handle case of label element but no label attribute
    
*) Transforms handle variable elements but not ivariable elements

*) handle tooltip in pane elements - need to provide default english element to
   eventually move away from attribute

*) Are "comment" and "tooltip" in the code I18N'd? Need rationalization?

0) process away tooltip attribute in variables (not in panes!), making it a comment attribute
    and then a comment element
    Note: Some decoders (e.g. xml/decoders//TCS_V51.xml) have both comment and tooltip attributes

1) Add <comment xml:lang=""> elements in decoderAddI18N,
    but only if there are others already (might be easiest to just take the english ones)

2) Add a pass to order by lang, comment by language for simplicity, see:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/572854/how-to-sort-a-subelement-of-xml-with-xslt
    
3) Probably have to do some stuff with panes too
    Translate tooltip attribute and elements

Done:
    programming/parts, dp3
    decoders/parts, nmra

Eventual goal is to update schema to enforce regular structure:
    variable element:
        remove label, comment, tooltip attributes in favor of elements
        
    pane element:
        remove name attribute in favor of elements
        remove tooltip attribute from display element in favor of elements
