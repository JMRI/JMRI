      <h1>JMRI: Java Version-Specific Features</h1>

      <p>This page contains information about the compatibility and features of various Java
      versions. We use this information to decide on our <a href="TechRoadMap.shtml">road map</a>
      for future JMRI versions. (For pre-Java-1.8 content, see the <a href=
      "JVMCapabilitiesOlder.shtml">historical page</a>.)</p>

      <p>Note: The Java community is moving from a "few big Java releases, years apart" development
      cycle to a cycle with a new release every six months, and a long-term support (LTS) release
      every three years. (For background, see <a href=
      "https://mreinhold.org/blog/forward-faster#Proposal">here</a>, <a href=
      "http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/322?elq_mid=102312&amp;sh=251225172624122582213150247717&amp;cmid=WWMK170418P00047">
      here</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html">here</a>). It's
      not yet clear what this will mean for JMRI's development and migration path. Much discussion
      is necessary.</p>

      <p>As of February 2018, Oracle has scheduled end-of-life for Java 8 in January 2019, and
      intends to release the next Long Term Support version (notionally known as both Java 11 and
      Java 18.9) in September of 2018. Given that some users will need to move forward for other
      applications once Java 8 is End Of Life, at a minimum we'll have to have JMRI running under
      both Java 8 and Java 11/18.9 by January 2019. For more information on this, see also this

      <h2>Capabilities</h2>

      <p>This section lists new Java capabilities, and which Java version they first appeared in.
      The "JDK" column shows the first Java Development Kit that could compile the feature; the
      "JRE" column lists the first runtime environment that could run the feature, including the
      needed JVM and library support.</p>

      <h2>JRE availability</h2>

      <p>This section lists the most recent Java Runtime version recommended by Oracle for various
      operating system versions. Please note that not all users of that operating system will have
      updated to this Java version; many will be using an older one.</p>

      <p>JMRI development requires Java 8u101 or later through January 2022. 8u101 contains a certificate change that's
      needed to link to some remote Javadocs. After that, Java 11 will be required.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/config-417990.html">Oracle's page
      on Java 1.7 requirements</a> says "Note: As of April 8, 2014 Microsoft stopped supporting
      Windows XP and therefore it is no longer a supported platform." Google finds numerous pages
      that show how to install Java 1.7 on XP or XP SP2. Although the corresponding <a href=
      "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/certconfig-2095354.html">Java 8 page</a> makes
      no mention of XP, it seems reasonable to assume the same applies. JMRI's <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/install/WindowsNew.shtml">Windows installation page</a> keeps updated
      information on this. Several JMRI users have reported that Java 1.8_151 is the last one that
      can be cleanly installed and run on XP. See the <a href=

      Model railroaders may not care if they're using a Java version that's supported. Some of them
      don't connect their layout computers to the internet; some have single-purpose machines that,
      if messed up, they'll just reload. But other JMRI users have multi-purpose machines whose
      security matters; essentially all of the JMRI developers are in this situation. At least some
      of the developers use dual-purpose machines that are required to meet various security and
      update standards. For those, Java 8 has increasing become a liability.

      <p>Java 11 JDK from Oracle only runs on 64-bit Windows versions (no 32-bit). <a href=
      "https://adoptopenjdk.net/">AdoptOpenJDK</a> continues to make 32 and 64-bit JREs and JDKs
      available. Light red indicates unable to run Java 8 or later; darker red means able to
      run Java 8, but not Java 11.</p>
