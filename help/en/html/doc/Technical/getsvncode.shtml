      <h1>JMRI Code: Getting the OLD SVN Code (archived)</h1>

      <h2>This page is kept for historical purposes only!</h2>

      <p class="important">JMRI has migrated away from <a href=
      "getcvscode.shtml">CVS</a> for version control to SVN in July
      2011, and on to Git in September 2015. For access to the
      current JMRI source code, please see the <a href=
      "getgitcode.shtml">Git repository</a> information.</p>

      <p>JMRI release 4.1.1 (and earlier) were made from SVN, and
      to access that source code, you should use the detailed
      instructions below.</p>

      <h2>Quick Start</h2>

      <p>You can download the JMRI source code from Subversion
      using:</p>
      <pre>
<code>
    svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jmri/code/trunk/jmri
  </code>
</pre>

      <h2>Details</h2>

      <p>Our source code up to JMRI version 4.1.2 was distributed
      using <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>.
      (Until then we also kept the <a href="WebSite.shtml">web
      site</a> in Subversion, if you'd like to work with it
      directly.) If you want to work with the code, a few minutes
      installing Subversion is well worth it. We're sorry, but we
      just can't support other methods (sending .zip files, etc),
      as they're just too error prone.</p>

      <p>A few computers will come with Subversion installed,
      mostly various Linux systems. If your computer does not have
      it installed, you will need to locate and install the needed
      client software. See the <a href=
      "http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html">Subversion
      binary downloads</a> page for packages for many operating
      systems (including Mac OS X, Windows and different Linux
      flavors).</p>

      <p>Many development environments (e.g., Netbeans or Eclipse)
      will have support for Subversion, either directly or as an
      add-on. Check the documentation for your favorite IDE to
      check on SVN support.</p>

      <p>The <a href=
      "https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Subversion">
      Subversion server at SourceForge</a> does not require any
      user information when you check out a copy of the code.</p>

      <p>If you have an existing copy of the code and want to
      update it to the most recent contents of the Subversion
      repository, the command is:</p>
      <pre>
  svn update
  
</pre>

      <p>See also the <a href="SVNFAQ.shtml">Subversion FAQ
      page</a>.</p>

      <p>After the checkout is complete, you'll find a top level
      directory called <tt>java</tt>, with subdirectories
      <tt>xml</tt>, <tt>resources</tt>, <tt>jython</tt>,
      <tt>help</tt>, <tt>lib</tt>, <tt>java</tt> and others.</p>

      <p>Change to the <tt>java</tt> directory. There, you will
      find a <tt>src</tt> directory that contains the source code
      for JMRI itself, and a <tt>tests</tt> directory that contains
      various test routines.</p>

      <p>You can look at the code with your favorite text editor.
      To compile and run it, you need one of the compilation tools
      described on the bar at the left: <a href=
      "Ant.shtml">Ant</a>, <a href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>,
      <a href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>, etc.</p>

      <p>Once you're working with the code, you'll probably create
      some improvements you'd like to contribute back to the
      project. This is where Subversion has tremendous advantages;
      with the appropriate permissions and commands, you can merge
      your changes back into the common source automagically.
      Contact us when you're ready to do that or see the <a href=
      "index.shtml#contributing">info on contributing</a>.</p>

      <h2>Access to Releases 2.12 and older</h2>

      <p>The best way to retrieve the source for releases 2.12 and
      earlier is from the <a href="getcvscode.shtml">CVS
      Repository</a>. Please see those instructions for
      details.</p>
