        <h1>LogixNG - Plugins for LogixNG</h1>

        <p style="color:yellow;background-color:red">LogixNG has gone thru big changes and the code
        for plugins is not up to date.</p>

        <h2>Plugins for LogixNG</h2>

        <p>JMRI supports extending JMRI in several ways by adding a jar file with classes to the
        JMRI class path. But LogixNG is stored in the panel xml files and these are validated when
        they are loaded, so when adding native expressions and actions, the logixng xml schema must
        be updated.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/danielb987/JMRI_LogixNG_Plugins">JMRI_LogixNG_Plugins</a> is
        an example project with some expression plugins and action plugins. The project has
        <a href="https://danielb987.github.io/JMRI_LogixNG_Plugins.Documentation/javadoc/">Javadoc</a>.
        The file <a href=
        "https://github.com/danielb987/JMRI_LogixNG_Plugins.Documentation/raw/master/docs/distribution/JMRI_LogixNG_Plugins.jar">
        JMRI_LogixNG_Plugins.jar</a> is the current version of the plugin. The classes in
        JMRI_LogixNG_Plugins are not considered useful but intended to demonstrate the
        possibilities with LogixNG. For example, ExpressionBlink and ActionHideAndShowPanel can be
        used to repeatedly hide and show a selected panel. It has no prototypical usage but can be
        used to play a joke with a fellow model railroader...</p>

        <h3>Implementing an expression or action plugin</h3>

        <p>In order to be able to save the configuration of the plugin in the panel XML files, the
        plugin saves and restores the configuration in a <strong>Map&lt;String,
        String&gt;</strong>. The developer of the plugin decides on how to store its configuration
        in this map.</p>

        <p>An expression or action that is a plugin must implement the
        <strong>ExpressionPlugin</strong> or the <strong>ActionPlugin</strong>. These interfaces
        has three additional methods.</p>

        <p><strong>init()</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Initializes the plugin. This method is called after an instance of the plugin is created
        if there exists a configuration. Note that this method is not called the first time an
        instance has been created, before it has been configured by the configurator.</p>

        <p><strong>getConfig()</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Returns the configuration for this plugin to be stored in for example a panel file.</p>

        <p><strong>getConfiguratorClassName()</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Returns the class name of the configurator class. In order to be able to use the plugin
        in a headless environment, the plugin itself is recommended to not use any swing code. This
        method is called then this plugin needs to be configurated and a class is needed that can
        configure this plugin. That class needs to be in the same jar file as this plugin and it
        needs to implement the <strong>PluginConfiguratorInterface</strong>. One configurator class
        may be the configurator for many plugins.</p>

        <h3>The PluginConfiguratorInterface interface</h3>

        <p>A class that is able to configure one or many plugins is called a configurator. It
        generates a <strong>JPanel</strong> with the controls that are needed to configure the
        plugin.</p>

        <p>The PluginConfiguratorInterface interface has these methods.</p>

        <p><strong>getConfigPanel()</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Returns a <strong>JPanel</strong> that can configure this plugin.</p>

        <p><strong>getConfigFromPanel()</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Returns the configuration for this plugin to be stored in for example a panel file.</p>

        <h3>Plugin in the JMRI classpath</h3>

        <p>JMRI can automaticly load plugins in the JMRI classpath. That is done by implementing a
        <strong>LogixNGPluginFactory</strong> that can tell JMRI about the expressions or actions
        and then mark it with the <a href="../plugins.shtml">@ServiceProvider</a> annotation. A
        single factory can register many classes. The <a href=
        "https://github.com/danielb987/JMRI_LogixNG_Plugins">JMRI_LogixNG_Plugins</a> has an
        example. <!--#include virtual="/Footer" --></p>
