<h1>LogixNG Tutorial</h1>

This tutorial has an <a href="PreviewLogixNG.jmri.zip">example profile</a>.
<p>
This tutorial has a number of chapters, there each chapter demonstrates some feature of LogixNG. Each chapter has its
own ConditionalNG in the example profile, and this ConditionalNG has the end result of each chapter.
<p>
The sensors, turnouts, and so on, that's used in this tutorial has system names like IS_3_5, there the first number is
the chapter it's used in.
<p>
Some chapters has a panel and the panels has names like "Chapter 1", that tells which chapter this panel is used for.

<h2>Notes for developers</h2>

The rest of the chapters are aimed at developers of JMRI. These chapters explains the internals of LogixNG and how to
use LogixNG from other parts of JMRI.

If you are developing some tool, for example something similat to SSL or SSM, and you want to use LogixNG as the
engine, there are some things that's good to know.

<h2>Replay a ConditionalNG</h2>

There are situations when the debugger is not enough. You might run the layout on a Raspberry Pi at the local model
railroad club and you may want to debug the layout at your home using your Windows computer. You can do that, by
activate logging of the session at the club, and then replay that session at home.

<p>

Replay



<h3>Logging of the layout</h3>


<h3>Notes for the JMRI developers: The male socket stack</h3>

LogixNG is designed to be modular and flexible with small classes with well defined purposes.

<ol>
<li>Standard male socket - manages the actions and expressions</li>
<li>Replay male socket - Replay a previous logged session</li>
<li>Debug male socket - Debug a session. Handle step by step debugging and breakpoints.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Menu choice "Tools / Tables / LogixNG" has a sub menu with three tables:
<ul>
<li>LogixNG</li>
<li>LogixNG Modules</li>
<li>LogixNG Tables</li>
</ul>

Select "Tools / Tables / LogixNG / LogixNG" to open the table with the LogixNGs. The other two tables,
"LogixNG Modules" and "LogixNG Tables", are described later in this tutorial.
<p>
On the "Meny" column, select "Edit" for the "Tutorial LogixNG". This brings up a table of ConditionalNGs that are
owned by this LogixNG. Each ConditionalNG in this tutorial has a user name starting with a number and a short
description. These user names are used as headers in this tutorial and demonstrates different things in LogixNG.

<hr>

<h2>1. Basics</h2>

Create a LogixNG
Create a ConditionalNG

Create an action: ActionTurnout

Remove the action and add the action IfThenElse.
Add ExpressionSensor and ActionTurnout

Lets add a new IfThenAction with a ExpressionSensor and a ActionTurnout. To do this, we need to add the action
Many. We can do this by cutting the IfThenElse expression so it's moved to the clip board, then add the Many
action and then paste the IfThenElse action back.




<hr>

<h2>00. Trigger once</h2>

Something may need to be done once to initialize things. For this purpose, there is the TriggerOnce expression
that returns true once and never more. This expression can be used to initialize things.




<hr>

<h2>10. Working with timers</h2>

<p>
Logix has a feature there a turnout or a sensor can be set delayed. This feature is not yet implemented in
LogixNG, except that you can use timers to do this in LogixNG. The reason for this not beeing implemented yet is
that I'm not sure how to implement this the best way. It's definitely possible to implement this the same way as
in Logix, but since LogixNG works somewhat different, it may be better to implement it different in LogixNG than
in Logix.

<p>
When the IS_10_1 sensor is active, the timer is started/reset. But as long as this sensor is active, the timer is
hold in the start condition. What if we want the sensor to only trigger a start, instead of holding it in the start
condition? We can do that by using the "Trigger Once" expression. It returns true the first time its child
expression returns true, but when returns false until its child expression has returned false.



<hr>

<h2>11. Controlling an engine</h2>

An exhibition has a model railroad that children can run. An adult presses a button and then a child can control
the layout by using a potentiometer and a switch for controlling the speed and direction of the engine. After five
minutes, the layout stops and the next child in queue will get to run the layout. The adult presses the button and
the layout works for five more minutes.

<p>
<ul>
<li>Sensor IS1 - The button the adult presses to run the layout.</li>
<li>Memory IM1 - For this example, we use a memory, but in real world we would use an AnalogIO, for example a
Meter.</li>
<li>Sensor IS2 - Sensor for controlling the direction of the engine.</li>
<li>Memory IM2 - The loco address.</li>
<li>Memory IM3 - Flag if the layout is running or not.</li>
</ul>

We use an ActionTimer to let the child run the layout for five minutes.
We use an ActionThrottle to control the engine.

<h2>90. Local variables and scripts</h2>

A script can use local variables. But local variables only exists during the execution of the action/expression
that defines the local variable. This ConditionalNG uses the same script in three different cases, there the local
variable is a number, a string or does not exist at all.
<p>
The script is in the file AAAAAA.AA. It's loaded by the ExpressionScript expression.

<p>
Select "Edit" for a ConditionalNG to open the ConditionalNG editor.
<p>
A ConditionalNG is a tree of actions and expressions, there some actions and some expressions can have children.
<p>
The editor doesn't know anything about actions nor expressions. Instead, the editor knows about female sockets and
male sockets. The female sockets is the exclamation marks and the question marks, followed by a name, for example "A4".
The name can be any number of letters and digits, starting with a letter.
<p>
The user never sees the male sockets, but each action and expression is encapsulated in a male socket.
<p>
Each ConditionalNG may have a memo there the user may enter some text, for example a description of the ConditionalNG.
Each ConditionalNGs in the example profile has a memo that describes that ConditionalNG.
