<h1>LogixNG Tutorial - Chapter 14</h1>

<h2>The debugger</h2>

Creating computer programs is an art. Good development tools help, but things doesn't always work as you expect. And
LogixNG is no exception. Sometimes, the rules you set up doesn't work. To help with this, LogixNG has a debugger.

<h3>Debug step by step</h3>

<h3>Adding break points</h3>

<h3>Watch local variables</h3>

The debugger displays the current local variables and their values. It's possible to change the value of a local
variable if desired.

<h3>Watch items</h3>

The intention is that the debugger should be able to show the state of things, like turnouts, signal masts, memories
and so on. This is not yet implemented.

<!--
Currently, the following items can be watched:

<ul>
<li>Local variables</li>
<li>Memories</li>
<li>Turnouts</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

-->
