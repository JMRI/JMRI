<h1>LogixNG Tutorial - Chapter 21</h1>

<h2>Adding a new action or expression</h2>


See the package <i>jmri.jmrix.loconet.logixng</i> for the classes mentioned in this part.
<p>
How do we add a new action or expression type to LogixNG? Lets assume we want to have an expression that looks at the
LocoNet slot manager and returns true if more that 75% of the slots are not free, false otherwise.
<p>
The first thing to notice is that is expression is LocoNet specific. Which means that it should be in a sub package to
jmri.jmrix.loconet and that the expression should not be available if there is no LocoNet connection. This is easy to
do. LogixNG uses <i>@ServiceProvider</i> to get a list of the available actions and expressions. For example, the class
<i>jmri.jmrit.logixng.expressions.DigitalFactory</i> provides a list of digital expressions. We can add our own factory class
for our LocoNet expression and we can make the method <i>getExpressionClasses()</i> conditional so that it only returns
our class if there is a LocoNet connection active.
<p>
Second, it may be helpful for the user if the LocoNet actions/expressions have their own category. So lets create that.
LogixNG has an "enum" Category, but since Java enums cannot be extended, the LogixNG Category class simulates an enum
without being a true enum class. We add the LocoNet category to the Factory class and let a static initializer in the
Factory class register the LocoNet category.
<p>
Now it's time to create the expression itself. For that, we need three classes. <i>ExpressionSlotUsage</i> that has the
expression itself, <i>ExpressionSlotUsageXml</i> that stores the expression to the panel xml file and <i>ExpressionSlotUsageSwing</i>
that has the swing editor for this expression.
<p>
For the expression itself, <i>ExpressionSlotUsage</i>, there is two important things to do. First, the expression needs to do
something useful, in this case check the slots in the slot manager. The <i>interface jmri.jmrit.logixng.DigitalExpression</i>
defines a digital expression and what it needs to do. It has a method <i>evaluate()</i> that returns a boolean. We need
to implement this method and it's here that we check the slots in the slot manager.
<p>
The second important thing we need to do in <i>ExpressionSlotUsage</i> is to register and unregister any listeners. In this
case, we want to listen for changed slots so we use the methods <i>registerListenersForThisClass()</i> and
<i>unregisterListenersForThisClass()</i> to register/unregister the listeners. Please check that listeners are not
registered twice. We do that by the varable <i>_listenersAreRegistered</i> to check if listeners has already been
registered.
<p>
The swing editor <i>ExpressionSlotUsageSwing</i> implements the <i>SwingConfiguratorInterface</i> that is used by the
ConditionalNG editor to create and edit actions and expressions. It does that by calling the method <i>getConfigPanel()</i>
in the <i>SwingConfiguratorInterface</i> that creates a JPanel with the components that are needed to configure the
action/expression. After the user has clicked "OK" to create a new expression or to save the changes, the method
<i>validate()</i> is called. If it returns true, a new object is created by a call to <i>createNewObject()</i> or the changes are
saved to the expresion by a call to <i>updateObject()</i>.
<p>
In the case of <i>ExpressionSlotUsageSwing</i>, we have a sentense like "The number of slots which 'has not' state 'COMMON or
IDLE' is 'less than' '32', there the parts within '' are JComponents that let the user select different things. But
this sentence needs to be translated to different languages and the order of words may be different in another language.
The <i>SwingConfiguratorInterface</i> has a method <i>parseMessage()</i> that takes the message that we get from the bundle, together
with the array of <i>JComponents</i>, and then returns a new list of JComponents there the message has been replaced by <i>JLabel</i>
components and there the <i>JComponents</i> has been ordered according to the language.
