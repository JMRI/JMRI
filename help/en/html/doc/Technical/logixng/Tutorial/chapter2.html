<h1>LogixNG Tutorial - Chapter 2</h1>

<h2>The clipboard</h2>

While editing a ConditionalNG, it can be useful to cut out something and leave it, editing something else, and then
paste it back. For this purpose, LogixNG has a clipboard. Each time you cut an action or expression, it is moved to the
clipboard.
<p>
The clipboard editor works the same way as the ConditionalNG editor, with the exceptions that actions and expressions
are never active while on the clipboard.
<p>
When an action or expression is cut, it will always be put on the first row in the clipboard. This is true even when
you cut an item on the clipboard itself. If you cut an item on the clipboard, that item will be removed from its
current place in the tree and moved to the first row in the tree.
<p>
Note that you can cut an item on any level in the clipboard tree. While editing a ConditionalNG, you may cut a big tree
from the ConditionalNG and you then wants to take only a small sub tree and paste back to the ConditionalNG.
<p>
Example:
* Many
  * IfThenElse
    * If sensor
	* Throw turnout
<p>
You can cut the Many action from the ConditionalNG, then go to the clipboard and expand the Many action and then cut
the IfThenElse action. The IfThenElse action will then be moved to the first row on the clipboard. Now you can go back
to the ConditionalNG and paste the IfThenElse action to the ConditionalNG.
<p>
You can also use the clipbord to move items from one ConditionalNG to another.
<p>
If the popup menu is opened on an item that can be copied, the menu item Copy is enabled. If "Copy" is selected, the
item and its sub tree are copied to the clipboard. Each item gets an auto system name and no user name.
