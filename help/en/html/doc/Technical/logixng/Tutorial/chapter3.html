<h1>LogixNG Tutorial - Chapter 3</h1>

This chapter lists some of the basic actions and expressions in LogixNG.


<h1>Basic actions and expressions</h1>


<h1>Actions</h1>



<h2>Many</h2>



<h2>IfThenElse</h2>




<h2>Logix</h2>

LogixNG has an action called Logix that emulates how JMRI Logix works. The action Logix has one expression and a number
of boolean actions. A boolean action is an action that takes a boolean value (true/false) and then decides what to do.
The action Logix was added mainly to support import of JMRI Logix to LogixNG.
<p>



<h1>Expressions</h1>

In Logix, the user can select between three different ways to combine the variables in the Conditional. And, Or and
Antecedent. In LogixNG, these three are expressions that can have other expressions as children.


<h2>And</h2>

And evaluates the child expressions and if all of them returns true, the And expression returns true as well.


<h2>Or</h2>

Or evaluates the child expressions and if at least one of them returns true, the And expression returns true as well.


<h2>Antecedent</h2>

The Antecedent expression is mainly included to make import from Logix to LogixNG simple. It works exactly as
Antecedent in Logix. It has a number of child expressions and an antecedent that defines how the evaluation of the
expressions should be done. Each child expression is referenced in the antecedent by R1, R2, R3, ..., there R1 is the
first child expression, R2 is the second child expression, and so on. Note that this differ from other expressions in
LogixNG, there other LogixNG expressions uses the socket name, but since the Antecedent expression is included to
work as Antecedent works in Logix, the antecedent has been kept from Logix Antecedent as well.
<p>
Note: Antecedent is included for compability with Logix but it's recommended to use Formula instead. Formula is much
more powerful, uses the socket names and also works with numbers and strings.


<h2>Formula</h2>

Formula is the next generation of Antecedent. It supports many operators, like ==, !=, <=, >=, <, >, +, -, *, / and %.
It supports local variables, memories and functions. It supports all the types of expressions, digital, analog and
string expressions.
