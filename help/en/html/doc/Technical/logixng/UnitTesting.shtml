        <h1>Unit testing of LogixNG</h1>

        <h2>Goals for unit testing of LogixNG</h2>

		<p>There are two main goals with the code that is testing LogixNG.</p>

		<ul>
      <li>The entire code must be tested completely, including every branch. This means that
      on the coverage report, both "Missed Instructions" and "Missed Branches" should be zero
      for every class in LogixNG. This goal is impossible to reach entirely, but whenether
      possible, this goal must be acheived.</li>

      <li>The tests must be as close as possible to "real world" testing. The testing infrastructure
      must test the code as realistically as possible.</li>
		</ul>
