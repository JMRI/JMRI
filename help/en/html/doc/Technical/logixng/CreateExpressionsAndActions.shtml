        <h1>LogixNG - Create Expressions, Actions, and so on</h1>

		<h2>The structure of LogixNG</h2>

		<p>LogixNG is a tree structure, where the root is a LogixNG.
		The LogixNG can have ConditionalNGs as children.</p>

		<p>A ConditionalNG have a female digital action socket
		to which an digital action can be connected.</p>
		
		Each
		ConditionalNG can have digital actions

		<h2>The locking mechanism</h2>

		<p>LogixNG has a lock that has three possible values.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>NONE - The item is not locked.</li>

          <li>USER_LOCK - The item is locked by the user and can be unlocked by the user.</li>

          <li>HARD_LOCK - The item is locked by a hard lock that cannot be unlocked by the
		  user by the user interface. But it can be removed by editing the xml file. This
		  lock is used for items that normally shouldn't be changed.</li>
        </ul>


		<h2>The Base interface</h2>

		<p>Expressions, Actions, and others, all implements the Base interface. It
		has methods that are common to everything in LogixNG.</p>

		<h3>Methods</h3>

		<h4>getSystemName</h4>

		<p>This is the same method as NamedBean.getSystemName(). It's included here
		to give the XML classes access to this method having MaleSocket extend
		NamedBean.</p>

		<h4>getConfiguratorClassName</h4>

		<p>Returns the fully qualified class name of the class that is used to
		configurate this class. That class needs to implement the
		jmri.jmrit.logixng.swing.PluginConfiguratorInterface interface.</p>

		<h4>getShortDescription</h4>

		<p>Get a short description of this item.</p>

		<h4>getLongDescription</h4>

		<p>Get a long description of this item.</p>

		<h4>getChild</h4>

		<p>Get a child of this item.</p>

		<h4>getChildCount</h4>

		<p>Get the number of children.</p>

		<h4>getCategory</h4>

		<p>Get the category.</p>

		<h4>isExternal</h4>

		<p>Is this external? Does it affects or is dependent on external things,
		like turnouts and sensors? Timers are considered as internal since they
		behavies the same on every computer on every layout.</p>

		<h4>getLock</h4>

		<p>Get the status of the lock.</p>

		<h4>setLock</h4>

		<p>Set the status of the lock.</p>

		<h2>Creating an Expression</h2>

		<p>An expression must implement the <strong>Expression</strong>
		interface, that in turn inherits the <strong>NamedBean</strong> interface.
		It's recommended that expression classes extends the
		<strong>AbstractExpression</strong> class which has a default implementation
		of the NamedBean interface.</p>

		<h3>Methods</h3>

		<h4>evaluate</h4>

		<p>Evaluates the expression and returns the result of the expression.</p>

		<h4>reset</h4>

		<p>Resets the evaluation. The method <strong>reset()</strong> is called then when
		the closest ancestor Action is activated. An example is a timer who is used to
		delay the execution of an action's child action.</p>
		<p>A parent expression must to call <strong>reset()</strong> on its children when
		the method <strong>reset()</strong> is called on the parent.</p>



		<h2>Creating an Action</h2>

		<p>An action must implement the <strong>Action</strong>
		interface, that in turn inherits the <strong>NamedBean</strong> interface.
		It's recommended that action classes extends the
		<strong>AbstractAction</strong> class which has a default implementation
		of the NamedBean interface.</p>

		<h3>Methods</h3>

		<p><strong>executeStart</strong></p>

		<p>Start execution of this Action.</p>

		<p><strong>executeContinue</strong></p>

		<p>Continue execution of this Action.</p>

		<p><strong>executeRestart</strong></p>

		<p>Restart the execute of this Action.</p>

		<p><strong>abort</strong></p>

		<p>Abort this action.</p>



		<h2>Creating an AnalogExpression</h2>

		<p>An analog expression must implement the <strong>AnalogExpression</strong>
		interface, that in turn inherits the <strong>NamedBean</strong> interface.
		It's recommended that expression classes extends the
		<strong>AbstractAnalogExpression</strong> class which has a default implementation
		of the NamedBean interface.</p>

		<h3>Methods</h3>

		<h4>evaluate</h4>

		<p>Evaluates the expression and returns the result of the expression.</p>



		<h2>Creating an AnalogAction</h2>

		<p>An analog action must implement the <strong>AnalogAction</strong>
		interface, that in turn inherits the <strong>NamedBean</strong> interface.
		It's recommended that analog action classes extends the
		<strong>AbstractAnalogAction</strong> class which has a default implementation
		of the NamedBean interface.</p>

		<h3>Methods</h3>

		<p><strong>setValue</strong></p>

		<p>Set an analog value.</p>



		<h2>Creating an StringExpression</h2>

		<p>A string expression must implement the <strong>Expression</strong>
		interface, that in turn inherits the <strong>NamedBean</strong> interface.
		It's recommended that string expression classes extends the
		<strong>AbstractStringExpression</strong> class which has a default implementation
		of the NamedBean interface.</p>

		<h3>Methods</h3>

		<h4>evaluate</h4>

		<p>Evaluates the string expression and returns the result of the string expression.</p>



		<h2>Creating an StringAction</h2>

		<p>A string action must implement the <strong>StringAction</strong>
		interface, that in turn inherits the <strong>NamedBean</strong> interface.
		It's recommended that string action classes extends the
		<strong>AbstractStringAction</strong> class which has a default implementation
		of the NamedBean interface.</p>

		<h3>Methods</h3>

		<p><strong>setValue</strong></p>

		<p>Set a string value.</p>



		<h2>Register an expression or an action</h2>

		<p>In order for JMRI to be able to use the expression or the action, it needs to be
		told about it. That is done by implementing a ExpressionFactory or a
		ActionFactory that can tell JMRI about the expressions or actions and then
		mark it with the <a href="../plugins.shtml">@ServiceProvider</a>
		annotation. A single factory can register many classes. For classes that are supplied
		with JMRI, it's recommended to use the <strong>DefaultExpressionFactory</strong>
		and the <strong>DefaultActionFactory</strong>.



        <h2>AbstractExpression and AbstractAction vs AbstractNamedBean</h2>

		<p>The <strong>NamedBean</strong> interface has the methods <strong>setState()</strong>
		and <strong>getState()</strong>. These should never be implemented in expressions
		and actions.</p>
		<p>For expressions, <strong>getState()</strong> returns
		<strong>Expression.TRUE</strong> or <strong>Expression.FALSE</strong>
		dependent on the last result of the expression, but this is handled automaticly by
		<strong>InternalExpression</strong>. The method <strong>setState()</strong> has no
		impact on expressions.</p>
		<p>For actions, neither of <strong>setState()</strong> or <strong>getState()</strong>
		will ever be called since <strong>InternalAction</strong> will prevent that.</p>
