<H1>JMRI: Viewing XML Files</H1>

JMRI stores various information in XML files.
Although they're a text format that is basically human-readable,
it's a complicated format.

<P>
To make them easier to read, print and understand, most JMRI XML
files can be displayed in a web browser.  A technique called
"XSLT stylesheets"
is used to format them within the web browser.  
For an example of how this looks, please see the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/xml/samples/NicksClinic.xml">sample panel XML file</a> on the main JMRI
web site. (May take a few seconds to load)

<p>
To view an XML file that JMRI has created, just open the file with your
favorite web browser.  In many cases, you should be able to just double-click
on it, or drag it to the web browser's icon.  On some computer types, you'll
need to open it from the "File" menu.

<p>
Unfortunately, this simple approach doesn't always work, because not all browsers
properly implement the algorithms for finding the formatting files that are
needed for this display.  
If the first browser you try doesn't display the XML file (usually just 
showing a blank page, though sometimes they'll display an error message),
please try other ones you've got installed.  Internet Explorer is particularly
problematic.  Mozilla, Safari and Opera seem to get this right, while Firefox 
seems to work properly on some platforms and not on others.  (There might also
be options that affect whether it works)
<p>
If none of the browsers available to you can display the file, 
you can get around this problem using the 
<a href="../../web/index.shtml">JMRI mini web server</a>
in JMRI version 2.9.4 and later.
<p>
To do this:
<UL>
<li>First, start JMRI. 
    <ul>
    <li>Either DecoderPro or PanelPro can
        be used, and no layout connection is needed. 
    <li>You do need to be using JMRI 2.9.4 or later.
    <li>The file you want to view must have been stored
        from JMRI 2.9.4 or later.  If it's older than that,
        just load it into JMIR 2.9.4 or later and store it again.
    </ul>
<li>Start the JMRI web server.  Under the Tools
    menu, select "Start JMRI Web Server".
<li>Open your web browser and enter the URL
    "<a href="http://localhost:12080/index.html">http://localhost:12080/index.html</a>"
<li>You should now see the JMRI logo on a index page.
    If your XML file is within the JMRI distribution directory,
    click on the "dist" link.  If it's within the 
    preferences directory, click on the "prefs" link.
<li>Finally, click on any needed directory names to get to your
    file, then click on your file.
</ul>

You can then use your browser to view, print, save, etc as desired.
