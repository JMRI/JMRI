      <h1>JMRI: Viewing XML Files</h1>
      <p>JMRI stores various information in XML files. Although
      they're a text format that is basically human-readable,
      it's a complicated, structured format.</p>

      <p>To make this information easier to read, print and understand, most
      JMRI XML files can be displayed in a web browser. A technique
      called "XSLT stylesheets" is used to format them within the
      web browser. For an example of how this looks, please see the
      <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/samples/NicksClinic.xml">sample
      panel XML file</a> on the main JMRI web site. (May take a few
      seconds to load)</p>

      <p>To view an XML file that JMRI has created, just open the
      file with your favorite web browser. In many cases, you
      should be able to just double-click on it, or drag it to the
      web browser's icon. On some platforms, you'll need to
      open it from the "File" menu.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, this simple approach doesn't always work,
      because not all browsers properly implement the algorithms
      for finding the formatting files that are needed for this
      display. If the first browser you try doesn't display the XML
      file (usually just showing a blank page, though sometimes
      they'll display an error message), please try other ones
      you've got installed. Internet Explorer is particularly
      problematic. Mozilla, Safari and Opera seem to get this
      right, while Firefox seems to work properly on some platforms
      and not on others. (There might also be options that affect
      whether it works. Here's some
      <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/XSLT/README">technical
      background</a>)</p>

      <p>If none of the browsers available to you can display the
      file, you can get around this problem using the <a href=
      "../../web/index.shtml">JMRI mini web server</a> in JMRI
      version 2.9.4 and later.</p>

      <p>To do this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First, start JMRI:

          <ul>
            <li>Either DecoderPro or PanelPro can be used, and no
            layout connection is needed.</li>

            <li>You do need to be using JMRI 2.9.4 or later.</li>

            <li>The file you want to view must have been stored
            from JMRI 2.9.4 or later. If it's older than that, just
            load it into JMIR 2.9.4 or later and store it
            again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Start the JMRI Web Server: from the Tools menu, select
        "Start JMRI Web Server".</li>

        <li>Open your web browser and enter the URL "<a href=
        "http://localhost:12080" target="_blank">http://localhost:12080</a>"</li>

        <li>You should now see the JMRI web page for your layout, like the
          example below.<br>
        If the XML file you wish to view is within the JMRI distribution
        directory, click on the "/dist" link at bottom right. If it's within
        the preferences directory, click on the "/prefs" link.</li>
        <li>
        <a href="images/Webstartxml.png">
          <img src="images/Webstartxml.png" height="286" width="410"></a>
        Finally, click on any needed directory names to get to
        your file, then click on your file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can then use your browser to view, print, save, etc.
      as desired.</p>
