<H1>JMRI: Building with XCode</H1>

<em>This page hasn't been updated to refer to our new Git
source code repository.  Please don't use the SVN-based instructions
below.</em>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>Recent versions of <b>Mac OS X</b> come with <b>Xcode</b>, a software 
development system developed for the Macintosh by Apple Computer. 
Xcode can be used to work with JMRI.

<p>The instructions below assume a fresh checkout of JMRI, along with a recent 
version of Xcode.

<H2>Procedure to setup JMRI on Xcode 4, 5 or 6</H2>
<ol>
<li><p>Start <b>Xcode</b> and dismiss any previous project window that appears.</p></li>
<li>File -> New -> New Project.  
<li>In the new window, on the left, select OS X Other.  On the right, select External Build System.
Click Next.
<li>Project name: JMRI.  Build tool: /usr/bin/ant  (XCode 6 may require /usr/local/bin/ant  
so check by saying "which ant" in a Terminal window)
<li>Click Next.
<li>Navigate to your JMRI checkout & select the main checked-out directory.  "java" should show in the window as the next level down.
Click "Create".
<li>You should get an XCode project window. In the center, it should say
"External Build Tool Configuration".  (You might have to click around to get there).
Change Arguments from $(ACTION) to decoderpro (or panelpro if you'd like; case matters)
<li>Just below that is a Directory field.  Click the icon at the right end to get a 
file chooser, and again select your checked-out directory.
<li>Click the run button, upper left. DecoderPro should start after a compilation cycle.
</ol>

<p>On XCode 5 and 6, the above runs the code, but doesn't make it easily editable.
Those XCode versions don't have strong Java edit, compile and debug support.
You might be better off with

or 
<a href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>.


<H2>Procedure to setup JMRI on Xcode 3</H2>
<ol>
<li><p>Start <b>Xcode,</b> dismiss any window that appears, and uncheck return to 
this window, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>Window>Organizer</b>. ( Note: Xcode now uses the Organizer window 
for Java, instead of the main Xcode window used in early  versions of Xcode.)</p></li>
<li><p>At the bottom left of the organizer window, in the "<b>+</b>" popup select 
"<b>Add Existing Folder...</b>"</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the "<b>java</b>" folder in your checkout of JMRI, and click 
<b>Open</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select "<b>java</b>" in the Organizer window. Click the <b>Clean</b> icon 
at the top of the Organizer window.  When that completes, hold down the 
<b>Build</b> icon, and select <b>ant 'compile</b>'.  This will compile all the 
JMRI source.</p></li>  
<li><p>Selecting <b>Build>ant 'jar'</b> will build a <b>jmri.jar</b> file.  The 
jar file is placed in your checkout folder.</p></li>
<li><p>To view or edit an existing source module, open the <b>java</b> folder at 
the top left in Organizer window (click the triangle on the left), then open the 
<b>sr</b>c folder, then the <b>apps</b> or <b>jmri</b> folder, etc. to find the 
file you're interested in.</p></li>
<li><p> To create an <b>ant 'panelpro'</b> entry in the Build list:</p>
	<ol type=a>
	<li><p>Select "<b>Edit Actions...</b>" in the Build list.</p></li>
	<li><p>Select <b>ant 'compile'</b> in the list at the left, and copy the 
	command that shows in the box on the right.</p></li>
	<li><p>In the <b>+</b> popup at the lower left, select "<b>New Shell 
	Script</b>".</p></li>
	<li><p>Change "<b>Shell Script</b>" to "<b>ant 'panelpro'</b> " in the list 
	on the left. </p></li>
	<li><p>Paste the text you copied in b into the right box, and change 
	"<b>compile</b>" to "<b>panelpro</b>".</p></li>
	<li><p>Click <b>OK</b>.</p></li>
	</ol>
   <p><b>Note:</b> Selecting <b>ant 'panelpro'</b> in the Build list, will 
   compile, build, and run <b>PanelPro</b>, with error and warning messages 
   displayed in an Xcode window.</p></li>
<li><p> You can follow 8 to set up to easily run any of the ant commands JMRI uses.
</ol>
<b>CAUTION:</b> This procedure requires JMRI 2.9.2 or later.  It has been tested 
using Mac OS X 10.6.2, using Xcode 3.2.1.  Earlier versions of JMRI (without the 
latest RXTX), may not find serial ports when JMRI is run from Xcode.</p>
