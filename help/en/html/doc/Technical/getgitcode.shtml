  <h1>JMRI Code: Getting the Code</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>"<a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>" is a powerful,
      free system for managing code as it's worked-on by a
      distributed group. It allows a group like JMRI to cooperate effectively.
      We keep the JMRI code, help files, sample scripts, XML files,
      etc. in a Git repository hosted on <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI">GitHub.com</a>. The <a href=
      "WebSite.shtml">JMRI web site</a> is in a similar repository.
      </p>

      <a name="view" id="view"></a>
      <h2>Viewing the Code Online</h2>

      <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">browse the
      JMRI code directly</a> on that site. For example, if you'd
      like to look at this page, <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/help/en/html/doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">
      click this link</a> to display its source HTML
      code.</p><a name="propose" id="propose"></a>

      <h3>Proposing Changes Online</h3><a href=
      "images/GitHubPencil.png"><img src="images/GitHubPencil.png"
      align="right" height="50" width="142" alt=
      "GitHub screen shot"></a>

      <p>If you want to suggest a change to a file, for example a
      web page like this one, first get a free <a href=
      "https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a> and sign in.</p>

      <p>Then go to the file you want to change and click the
      pencil icon on the upper-right of the page.</p>

      <p><a href="images/GitHubProposeFileChange.png"><img src=
      "images/GitHubProposeFileChange.png" align="right" height=
      "135" width="221" alt="GitHub screen shot"></a> This will,
      after a second or two, give you a page where you can edit the
      contents of the file with your suggested change. Don't worry,
      you're not actually changing JMRI's original code, just your
      personal copy of the code.</p>

      <p>Then fill out the form at the bottom with a useful subject
      line, and a description of why this is a good change, and
      click the "Propose file change" button. This saves your edits
      to your personal copy on the Git server.<br>
      Next, click on the "Pull request" button at the top right of
      the code panel. This sends your change to the people who've
      agreed to maintain the JMRI central code, who will review and
      (usually) include it in the next JMRI release (<a href=
      "gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">more details</a>).</p><a name="get"
      id="get"></a>

      <h2>Get Your Own Copy</h2>

      <p>Our source code is distributed using <a href=
      "https://git-scm.com">Git</a>. (We also keep the <a href=
      "WebSite.shtml">web site</a> in Git, if you'd like to work
      with the source for that directly.) If you want to work with
      the JMRI code, the full <a href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a>,
      or any other large part of JMRI, spending a couple minutes
      getting Git set up is well worth it. We're sorry, but we just
      can't support other methods (sending around individual files,
      etc.), as they're just too error prone.</p>

      <p>Although there are lots of ways to use Git, the next
      sections show the most common ones:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#desktop">Using the GitHub Desktop
        application</a> (Mac or Windows only)</li>

        <li><a href="#cmd">Using the command line</a></li>

        <li><a href="#ide">Using an Integrated Development
        Environment (IDE)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you want to develop changes to the code, see the
      "<a href="gitdeveloper.shtml">Developing with JMRI Code</a>"
      page.</p>

      <p>Also check the <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">JMRI Git FAQ
      page</a>.</p><a name="desktop" id="desktop"></a>

      <h3>Using the GitHub Desktop Application</h3>

      <p>The <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub
      Desktop</a> application is a very convenient tool for working
      with Git repositories. Unfortunately, it's only available for
      Mac and Windows. For Linux, please use one of the other
      methods.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>There's a download link on the <a href=
        "https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop application web
        page</a>. Get the download and install it using the
        instructions there.</li>

        <li>Open the GitHub Desktop application.</li>

        <li>In your web browser, go to the GitHub site for the
        "<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">JMRI
        repository</a>" (clicking the link should take you
        there).</li>

        <li>Click the "Clone in Desktop" button on the top
        right.<br>
        <a href="images/GitHubCloneDeskop.png"><img src=
        "images/GitHubCloneDeskop.png" alt=
        "Clone to desktop button in GitHub web" height="315" width=
        "409"></a></li>

        <li>The GitHub Desktop application will show a dialog where
        you can select the download location. Change that if
        desired:<br>
        <a href="images/GhDtCloneDialog.png"><img src=
        "images/GhDtCloneDialog.png" alt=
        "Clone dialog in GitHub Desktop Mac" height="184" width=
        "267"></a><br>
        and click "Clone".</li>

        <li>The download will start. It's likely to take a couple
        minutes.</li>

        <li>For more details, see the our <a href=
        "GitFAQ.shtml">Git FAQ help page</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After the download is complete, there are menu items under
      the application "Repository" menu to access the code
      directory:<br>
      <a href="images/GitDtRepoSettingsMenu.png"><img src=
      "images/GitDtRepoSettingsMenu.png" alt=
      "Repository menu in GitHub Desktop" height="175" width=
      "275"></a>
      <br>You can also navigate there directly using your file
      system.</p>
      <p>Inside, you'll find directories called <tt>xml</tt>,
      <tt>resources</tt>, <tt>jython</tt>, <tt>help</tt>,
      <tt>lib</tt>, <tt>java</tt> and others.</p>

      <p>In the <tt>java</tt> directory, you will find a
      <tt>src</tt> directory that contains the source code for JMRI
      itself, and a <tt>tests</tt> directory that contains various
      test routines.</p>

      <p>You can look at the code with your favorite text
      editor.<br>
      To compile and run the code, you need one of the compilation
      tools described on the bar at the left: <a href=
      "Ant.shtml">Ant</a>, <a href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>,
      <a href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>, <a href=
      "IntelliJ.shtml">IntelliJ</a>, etc. (Ant may be the easiest
      to install and use, and is the primary example in the
      documentation)</p><a name="cmd" id="cmd"></a>

      <h3>Using the command line</h3>

      <p>First, check whether Git is installed on your computer.
      From a command line, do<br>
      <code>git --version</code> (note the two hyphens).<br>
      If it replies with a version greater than 2, e.g. 2.3.8,
      you're all set. If not, there are <a href=
      "GitFAQ.shtml#install">instructions for installing Git</a> in
      the <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">Git FAQ</a>. Install Git, then
      come back here.</p>

      <p>To get a local copy of the code, you tell Git to "clone"
      it from our repository. The command to do that is:</p>
      <pre>
<code>
  $ git clone https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git
  </code>
</pre>This will create a new "JMRI" directory and download the code
into it.

      <p>If you have already gotten a copy of the code on your
      computer and want to update it to the most recent contents of
      the main JMRI repository, start in the JMRI code directory
      and to:</p>
      <pre>
<code>
  $ git pull https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git
  </code>
</pre>

      <p>After the checkout is complete, go to the new JMRI
      directory that was created. Inside, you'll find directories
      called <tt>xml</tt>, <tt>resources</tt>, <tt>jython</tt>,
      <tt>help</tt>, <tt>lib</tt>, <tt>java</tt> and others.</p>

      <p>In the <tt>java</tt> directory, you will find a
      <tt>src</tt> directory that contains the source code for JMRI
      itself, and a <tt>tests</tt> directory that contains various
      test routines.</p>

      <p>You can look at the code with your favorite text
      editor.</p>

      <p>To compile and run the code, you need one of the
      compilation tools described on the bar at the left: <a href=
      "Ant.shtml">Ant</a>, <a href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>,
      <a href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>, <a href=
      "IntelliJ.shtml">IntelliJ</a> etc. (Ant may be the easiest to
      install and use, and is the primary example in the
      documentation)</p><a name="ide" id="ide"></a>

      <h3>Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h3>

      <p>Most IDEs have Git support build in. For the ones that can
      build JMRI, we have specific instructions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="Ant.shtml">Ant</a></li>

        <li><a href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a></li>

        <li><a href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a></li>

        <li><a href="IntelliJ.shtml">IntelliJ</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Access to Old Releases</h2>

        <p>The best way to retrieve the source for releases 4.1.2 and
      earlier is from the <a href="getsvncode.shtml">SVN
      Repository</a> (see the link for details.</p>

      <p>The best way to retrieve the source for releases 2.12 and
      earlier is from the <a href="getcvscode.shtml">CVS
      Repository</a> (see the link for details.</p>
