      <h1>JMRI Code: Getting the Code</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>"<a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>" is a powerful, free system for managing code as
      it's worked-on by a distributed group. It allows a group like JMRI to cooperate effectively.
      We keep the JMRI code, help files, sample scripts, XML files, etc. in a Git repository hosted
      on <a href="https://github.com/JMRI">GitHub.com</a>. The <a href="WebSite.shtml">JMRI web
      site</a> is in a similar repository.</p>

      <h2 id="view">Viewing the Code Online</h2>

      <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">browse the JMRI code directly</a> on that
      site. For example, if you'd like to look at this page, <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/help/en/html/doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">click
      this link</a> to display its source HTML code.</p>

      <h3 id="propose">Proposing Changes Online</h3>

      <p>If you want to suggest a change to a file, for example a web page like this one, first get
      a free <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a> and sign in.</p>

      <p><a href="images/GitHubPencil.png"><img src="images/GitHubPencil.png"
      class="floatRight" alt="GitHub screen shot"></a>Then go to the file you want to change and click the pencil icon on the upper-right of the
      page.</p>

      <a href="images/GitHubProposeFileChange.png"><img src="images/GitHubProposeFileChange.png"
      alt="GitHub screen shot"></a>
      <p>This will, after a second or two, give you a page where you can edit the contents of the
      file with your suggested change. Don't worry, you're not actually changing JMRI's original
      code, just your personal copy of the code.</p>

      <p>Then fill out the form at the bottom with a useful subject line, and a description of why
      this is a good change, and click the "Propose file change" button. This saves your edits to
      your personal copy on the Git server.<br>
      Next, click on the "Pull request" button at the top right of the code panel. This sends your
      change to the people who've agreed to maintain the JMRI central code, who will review and
      (usually) include it in the next JMRI release (<a href="gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">more
      details</a>).</p>

      <h2 id="get">Get Your Own Copy</h2>

      <p>Our source code is distributed using <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>. (We also keep
      the <a href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a> in Git, if you'd like to work with the source for
      that directly.) If you want to work with the JMRI code, the full <a href="WebSite.shtml">web
      site</a>, or any other large part of JMRI, spending a couple minutes getting Git set up is
      well worth it. We're sorry, but we just can't support other methods (sending around
      individual files, etc.), as they're just too error prone.</p>

      <p>Although there are lots of ways to use Git, the next sections show the most common
      ones:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#desktop">Using the GitHub Desktop application</a> (Mac or Windows only)
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#cmd">Using the command line</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#ide">Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you want to develop changes to the code, see the "<a href=
      "gitdeveloper.shtml">Developing with JMRI Code</a>" page.</p>

      <p>Also check the <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">JMRI Git FAQ page</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="desktop">Using the GitHub Desktop Application</h3>

      <p>The <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a> application is a very
      convenient tool for working with Git repositories. Unfortunately, it's only available for Mac
      and Windows. For Linux, please use one of the other methods.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>There's a download link on the <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop
        application web page</a>. Get the download and install it using the instructions there.
        </li>

        <li>Open the GitHub Desktop application.</li>

        <li>In your web browser, go to the GitHub site for the "<a href=
        "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">JMRI repository</a>" (clicking the link should take you
        there).
        </li>

        <li>Click the "Clone in Desktop" button on the top right.<br>
          <a href="images/GitHubCloneDeskop.png"><img src="images/GitHubCloneDeskop.png" alt=
          "Clone to desktop button in GitHub web"></a>
        </li>

        <li>The GitHub Desktop application will show a dialog where you can select the download
        location. Change that if desired:<br>
          <a href="images/GhDtCloneDialog.png"><img src="images/GhDtCloneDialog.png" alt=
          "Clone dialog in GitHub Desktop Mac"></a><br>
          and click "Clone".
        </li>

        <li>The download will start. It's likely to take a couple minutes.</li>

        <li>For more details, please see the our <a href="githubdesktopintro.shtml">page on using
        GitHub Desktop</a> and the <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">Git FAQ help page</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>After the download is complete, there are menu items under the application "Repository"
      menu to access the code directory:<br>
      <a href="images/GitDtRepoSettingsMenu.png"><img src="images/GitDtRepoSettingsMenu.png" alt=
      "Repository menu in GitHub Desktop"></a><br>
      You can also navigate there directly using your file system.</p>

      <p>Inside, you'll find directories called <code>xml</code>, <code>resources</code>,
      <code>jython</code>, <code>help</code>, <code>lib</code>, <code>java</code> and others.</p>

      <p>In the <code>java</code> directory, you will find a <code>src</code> directory that
      contains the source code for JMRI itself, and a <code>tests</code> directory that contains
      various test routines.</p>

      <p>You can look at the code with your favorite text editor.<br>
      To compile and run the code, you need one of the compilation tools described on the bar at
      the left: <a href="Ant.shtml">Ant</a>, <a href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>, <a href=
      "NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>, <a href="IntelliJ.shtml">IntelliJ</a>, etc. (Ant may be the
      easiest to install and use, and is the primary example in the documentation)</p>

      <p>For more information on using the GitHub Desktop application, please see the our <a href=
      "githubdesktopintro.shtml">page on using GitHub Desktop</a> and the <a href=
      "GitFAQ.shtml">Git FAQ help page</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="cmd">Using the command line</h3>

      <p>First, check whether Git is installed on your computer. From a command line, do<br>
      <code>git --version</code> (note the two hyphens).<br>
      If it replies with a version greater than 2, e.g. 2.3.8, you're all set. If not, there are
      <a href="GitFAQ.shtml#install">instructions for installing Git</a> in the <a href=
      "GitFAQ.shtml">Git FAQ</a>. Install Git, then come back here.</p>

      <p>To get a local copy of the code, you tell Git to "clone" it from our repository. The
      command to do that is:</p>

      <pre>
<code>
  $ git clone https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git
  </code>
</pre>
      This will create a new "JMRI" directory and download the code into it.
      <p>If you have already gotten a copy of the code on your computer and want to update it to
      the most recent contents of the main JMRI repository, start in the JMRI code directory and
      to:</p>

      <pre>
<code>
  $ git pull https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git
  </code>
</pre>
      <p>After the checkout is complete, go to the new JMRI directory that was created. Inside,
      you'll find directories called <code>xml</code>, <code>resources</code>, <code>jython</code>,
      <code>help</code>, <code>lib</code>, <code>java</code> and others.</p>

      <p>In the <code>java</code> directory, you will find a <code>src</code> directory that
      contains the source code for JMRI itself, and a <code>tests</code> directory that contains
      various test routines.</p>

      <p>You can look at the code with your favorite text editor.</p>

      <p>To compile and run the code, you need one of the compilation tools described on the bar at
      the left: <a href="Ant.shtml">Ant</a>, <a href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>, <a href=
      "NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>, <a href="IntelliJ.shtml">IntelliJ</a> etc. (Ant may be the
      easiest to install and use, and is the primary example in the documentation)</p>

      <h3 id="ide">Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h3>

      <p>Most IDEs have Git support build in. For the ones that can build JMRI, we have specific
      instructions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="Ant.shtml">Ant</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="IntelliJ.shtml">IntelliJ</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Access to Old Releases</h2>
