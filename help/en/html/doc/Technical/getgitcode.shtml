  <h1>JMRI: Getting the Code (Git Version in Development)</h1>

<em>Note that this page is under development.  JMRI
is considering migrating to using Git instead of Subversion (SVN).
Until that's decided and done, this page isn't relevant for 
JMRI users.</em>

  <h2>Quickstart</h2>

  <p>"<a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>" 
  is a powerful, free system for managing 
  code as it's worked-on by a distributed group.  Like SVN before it, 
  and CVS before that, it allows a group like JMRI to cooperate effectively.
  We keep our code, help files, 
  <a href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a>, 
  and everything else in a 
  Git repository hosted on 
  <a href="https://github.com/JMRI">GitHub.com</a>.
  
<h3>Viewing the Code Online</h3>
  <p>You can 
  <a href="">browse the JMRI code directly</a> <em>(link not permanent)</em>
  on that site. For example, if you'd like to look at this page,
  <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/jmri-test/blob/master/help/en/html/doc/Technical/getcode.shtml">click this link</a> <em>(link not permanent)</em>
  to see the source HTML code displayed.
  </p>

<a href="GitHubPencil.png"><img src="GitHubPencil.png" align="right" height="50" width="142"></a>
<h3>Proposing Changes</h3>
  
  <p>If you want to suggest a change to a file, first get a free
  <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a> and sign in.
  <a href="GitHubProposeFileChange.png "><img src="GitHubProposeFileChange.png " align="right" height="135" width="221"></a>
  Then go to the file you want to change and click the pencil icon on the upper-right of the page.
  This will, after a second or two, give you a page where you can directly edit the
  contents of the file.  Don't worry, you're not actually changing JMRI's version, just
  a copy local to you. Then fill out the form at the bottom with a useful subject
  line, and a description of why this is a good change, and click the
  "Propose file change" button.  This sends your change to the people who've
  agreed to maintain the JMRI central code, who will review and (usually) include it in 
  the new JMRI release.
  
  
  
  
  <p>Note that this will give you a bare copy. If you want to make
  changes, and hopefully contribute them back to the JMRI project 
  so others can benefit from them, we recommend that you use 
  the "Clone in Desktop" button instead.  This will 
  require you to have installed
  "<a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a>" tool, which you can get from 
  <a href="https://desktop.github.com">here</a>.
  See below for more info.
  
  <h2>Access to the Full Code</h2>


  <p>Our source code is distributed using <a
  href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>.  (We also keep
  the <a href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a> in Git, if you'd like
  to work with the source for that directly.)  
  If you want to work with the JMRI code, 
  the full <a href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a>,
  or any other large part of JMRI, 
  a minutes getting Git set up is well worth it.  We're sorry, but we
  just can't support other methods (sending around individual files, etc), as they're
  just too error prone.</p>

  <p>It's possible to use Git from the command line, or from inside various 
  IDEs like XCode or NetBeans.  Some of the JMRI developers prefer that approach.
  But if you're new and reading this, we recommend that you 
  interact with our code repository through the
  "<a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a>" tool.
  Download it via <a href="https://desktop.github.com">this link</a>,
  install it and take the tutorial.
  
  <p><em>
  Note: GitHub Desktop is not (currently) available on the Linux platform. 
  As a result, it might be necessary to locate and install the needed client 
  software suitable for your flavor of Linux.  See the
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git downloads</a> 
  page for packages for many operating systems.  Alternatively, check the
  usual package manager for your flavor of Linux.
  </em></p>

  <p>Many development environments (e.g., Netbeans or Eclipse) will have
  support for Git, either directly or as an add-on.  Check the
  documentation for your favorite IDE for details on Git support.
  <ul>
  <li>In NetBeans, under the "Team" menu, select Git, then Clone Repository.
    Enter the repository URL from the 
    <a href="">JMRI GitHub page</a><em>(not final URL)</em>
    under "Repository URL" on the NetBeans form.  We recommend that you
    also enter your GitHub user name and password on the form, so 
    we can attribute your contributions to you later. Click "Next".
    Make sure that the "master*" box is checked to pull down the main
    version of the code. Click "Next", and then click "Finish".
    It'll take a few minutes to pull down a copy of the code
    (note the progress bar in the lower right), 
    and then you're good to go.
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  <em>(Paragraph not changed:  Decide whether to put in a 
  command here, or a GitHub Desktop walkthrough, or comments on various IDEs)</em>
  If you have an existing copy of the code and want to update it
  to the most recent contents of the main JMRI repository, the command is:
  <pre>
  svn update
  </pre></p>

  <p>See also the <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">JMRI Git FAQ page</a>.</p>

  <p>After the checkout is complete, go to the new directory.
  Inside, you'll find 
  directories called <tt>xml</tt>,
  <tt>resources</tt>, <tt>jython</tt>, <tt>help</tt>, <tt>lib</tt>,
  <tt>java</tt> and others.</p>

  <p>Change to the <tt>java</tt> directory.  There, you will find a <tt>src</tt>
  directory that contains the source code for JMRI itself, and a <tt>tests</tt>
  directory that contains various test routines.</p>

  <p>You can look at the code with your favorite text editor.  To
  compile and run it, you need one of the compilation tools described
  on the bar at the left: <a href="Ant.shtml">Ant</a>, <a
   href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>, <a
   href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>, <a
   href="JBuilder.shtml">JBuilder</a>, etc.  (Ant may be the easiest to
  install and use, and is the primary example in the documentation)</p>

  <p>Once you're working with the code, you'll probably create some improvements
  you'd like to contribute back to the project.  This is where Git has tremendous
  advantages; you can submit a "pull request" which will allow us to merge your
  changes back into the common source automagically.  </p>
  
  <p>
  Exactly how you do that depends a bit on what tools you're using.
  <ul>
  <li>If you're using GitHub Desktop, there's a pull-request button on the upper right.
  Click it, fill out the form, and click "Send Pull Request".
  <li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Access to Old Releases</h2>

  <p>The best way to retrieve the source for releases 4.1.1 and earlier
  is from the <a href="getsvncode.shtml">SVN Repository</a>.  Please
  see those instructions for details.</p>

  <p>The best way to retrieve the source for releases 2.12 and earlier
  is from the <a href="getcvscode.shtml">CVS Repository</a>.  Please
  see those instructions for details.</p>
