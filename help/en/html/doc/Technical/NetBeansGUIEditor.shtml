      to using the Builder tool. See <a href=

      <h2><a id="intro" name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

      <p>NetBeans 7.4 or 8.0 includes a Swing GUI Builder that
      makes it easier to maintain a Java Swing-based GUI (such as
      JMRI) than writing the user interface entirely by hand.</p>

      <p>This tool can create code that is not ideally separated
      into human-maintained and generated Java code. If you use
      NetBeans, you are protected from this, as the Builder does a
      good job of integrating its views with the source editor.
      However, if you use another editor, you will be exposed to
      this.</p>

      <h2><a id="usage" name="usage">Using the Builder</a></h2>

      <p>The NetBeans IDE editor toolbar will automatically contain
      a button labeled <strong>Design</strong> if the Class being
      edited can also be edited in the Swing GUI Builder.</p>

      <p>Clicking the <strong>Design</strong> button will present
      the ability to drag buttons, labels, panels, and other
      objects onto a window to visually place them. Any object that
      conforms to the <a href=
      "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/spec-136004.html">
      JavaBean</a> standard can be placed on the window and linked
      to other objects on the window, even if it does not have a
      visual representation.</p>

      <p>Where the Builder cannot automatically generate code, it
      provides empty, or stub, methods that can be completed to
      implement the desired logic, and will automatically switch to
      the code view as needed.</p>

      <h2><a id="code" name="code">Examining the Code</a></h2>

      <p>The Builder maintains two files: a .java file, containing
      compilable code, and a .form file, containing an XML
      representation of GUI along with code that is used to create
      the initComponents() method in the .java file.</p>

      <h3><a href="java">.java File</a></h3>

      <p>In NetBeans, the code generated by the Builder, looks just
      like any other Java code, although portions of it cannot be
      edited (NetBeans simply does not allow the code to be
      changed). Stub methods will be editable, however, it will not
      be possible to change the method signatures (name,
      parameters, return values, or throws clauses).</p>

      <p>A method, <code>private void initComponents()</code></p>

      <p>Other tools, however, will display the code very
      differently, and the code will contain the following
      non-standard, though valid, markings as comments that are
      hidden in NetBeans:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>// &lt;editor-fold defaultstate="collapsed"
        desc="Generated Code"&gt;</dt>

        <dd>Hides everything between it and <code>//
        &lt;/editor-fold&gt;</code> with the description
        <em>Generated Code</em> in NetBeans and other editors that
        recognize it. Code between these two comments can be viewed
        by clicking the <strong>+</strong> icon to the left of the
        description in those editors. It is used to hide code that
        should not be edited by hand.</dd>

        <dt>// &lt;/editor-fold&gt;</dt>

        <dd>Used with <code>// &lt;editor-fold
        defaultstate="collapsed" desc="Generated Code"&gt;</code>.
        See that comment's description for more information.</dd>

        <dt>//GEN-BEGIN:<em>&lt;token&gt;</em></dt>

        <dd>Precedes a method or block of variables that is
        completely generated by the Builder. Such a method or block
        is followed by a corresponding
        <code>//GEN-END:<em>&lt;token&gt;</em></code> comment.</dd>

        <dt>//GEN-END:<em>&lt;token&gt;</em></dt>

        <dd>Follows a method or block of variables that is
        completely generated by the Builder. Such a method or block
        is preceded by a corresponding
        <code>//GEN-BEGIN:<em>&lt;token&gt;</em></code>
        comment.</dd>

        <dt>//GEN-FIRST:<em>&lt;token&gt;</em></dt>

        <dd>Precedes a method that generated code calls, but the
        body of which is written by a developer. Such a method is
        followed by a corresponding
        <code>//GEN-LAST:<em>&lt;token&gt;</em></code> comment. The
        token is often
        <code>event_<em>&lt;methodName&gt;</em></code>.</dd>

        <dt>//GEN-LAST:<em>&lt;token&gt;</em></dt>

        <dd>Follows a method that generated code calls, but the
        body of which is written by a developer. This comment marks
        the closing curly brace in the method preceded by the
        corresponding
        <code>//GEN-FIRST:<em>&lt;token&gt;</em></code>
        comment.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3><a href="form">.form File</a></h3>

      <p>The .form file is completely hidden within the NetBeans
      IDE. Opening a .java file with a corresponding .form file
      (the same file name in the same package) will add the
      <strong>Design</strong> button to the editor tool bar,
      allowing the Builder to be used.</p>

      <p>The .form file is an XML file adhering to the DTD in
      <a href=
      "http://hg.netbeans.org/core-main/file/tip/form/src/org/netbeans/modules/form/forminfo/forms.dtd">
      the NetBeans source code</a> (linked to the head of the
      NetBeans trunk). NetBeans uses this file to store additional
      information outside the JavaBeans specification that is
      required to correctly generate the
      <code>initComponents()</code> method, stub methods, and
      variable lists. In the absence of other changes to the .java
      file, this file could be used to completely generate a new
      .java file, should that be necessary.</p>

      <p>This file should not be edited by hand, but should be
      generated by the Builder.</p>
