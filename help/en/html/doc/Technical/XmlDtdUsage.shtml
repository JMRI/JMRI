<H1>JMRI: XML DTD Usage</H1>

<b>This page describes the usage of XML DTDs in JMRI
before version 2.9.4.  These DTDs were replaced
with XML schema in JMRI 2.9.4.</b>
<P>
In the JMRI distributions, the DTDs are stored in the 
<a href="/xml/DTD">xml/DTD</a> 
directory. 
Note that they are not stored in each directory
alongside the XML files. There are just too many 
locations to keep such a set of DTD files up to date.
JMRI itself, via the jmri.jmrit.XmlFile class, provides
support for locating those files when the XML parser
needs them.  
<p/>
Each file contains a DOCTYPE line that
specifies a DTD name. There are three different methods
used to locate the actual DTD file:
<ul>
<li>Web browsers look exactly where the DOCTYPE line specifies,
and must find the DTD there to function.
<li>JMRI 1.8 and earlier 
assumes that the name is relative to
the program's xml/DTD directory, and looks for it using that.
In practice, this allows two forms for the DOCTYPE line:
  <ul>
  <li>name.dtd
  <li>../DTD/name.dtd
  </ul>
Early XML files used both; the program itself could generate
either depending on the circumstances.
<li>JMRI 1.9.2 and later provide a more powerful DTD search procedure using the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/JmriLocalEntityResolver.html">jmri.util.JmriLocalEntityResolver</a>
class. It parses the
reference in the DOCTYPE and handles it in several ways:
    <ul>
    <li>If it's an HTTP URL, JMRI first attempts to
    find the corresponding file in the local distribution.
    If so, it uses the local copy, otherwise it attempts to load a copy
    from the Internet using the URL.
    <li>If it's a file path that starts with "../DTD/",
    JMRI looks in it's local xml/DTD directory for the DTD file.
    <li>If the path is just a filename,
    JMRI looks in it's local xml/DTD directory for the DTD file.
    <li>In any other case, e.g. a local or absolute pathname,
    JMRI looks there for the DTD file.  Relative pathnames
    are interpreted as starting from the JMRI install directory.
    </ul>
    If the file can't be found, the XML file isn't opened.
    <p/>
    These JMRI versions write just the DTD filename in the DOCTYPE
    line when writing XML files.
    <p/>
    This provides complete backward compatibility with existing
    files and older versions of JMRI back to 1.7.1.
    At the same time, since it can handle HTTP URLs even without
    an Internet connection, it allows us to eventually move forward.
</ul>

<b>Starting with JMRI 2.9.4, JMRI uses 
<a href="XmlSchema.shtml">XML schema</a>
instead of DTDs, 
and this process is different.</b>
