  <h1>JMRI: XML DTD Usage</h1>

      <p class="important">This page describes the former usage
      of XML DTDs in JMRI before version 2.9.4. The use of these
      DTDs in JMRI was replaced with
      <a href="XmlSchema.shtml">XML schema</a> in JMRI 2.9.4.</p>

      <p>In the JMRI distributions, the DTDs are stored in the
      <a href="/xml/DTD">xml/DTD</a> directory. Note that they are
      not stored in each directory alongside the XML files. There
      are just too many locations to keep such a set of DTD files
      up to date. JMRI itself, via the jmri.jmrit.XmlFile class,
      provides support for locating those files when the XML parser
      needs them.</p>Each file contains a DOCTYPE line that
      specifies a DTD name. There are three different methods used
      to locate the actual DTD file:

      <ul>
        <li>Web browsers look exactly where the DOCTYPE line
        specifies, and must find the DTD there to function.</li>

        <li>JMRI 1.8 and earlier assumes that the name is relative
        to the program's xml/DTD directory, and looks for it using
        that. In practice, this allows two forms for the DOCTYPE
        line:

          <ul>
            <li>name.dtd</li>

            <li>../DTD/name.dtd</li>
          </ul>Early XML files used both; the program itself could
          generate either depending on the circumstances.
        </li>

        <li>JMRI 1.9.2 and later provide a more powerful DTD search
        procedure using the <a href=
        "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/JmriLocalEntityResolver.html">
          jmri.util.JmriLocalEntityResolver</a> class. It parses
          the reference in the DOCTYPE and handles it in several
          ways:

          <ul>
            <li>If it's an HTTP URL, JMRI first attempts to find
            the corresponding file in the local distribution. If
            so, it uses the local copy, otherwise it attempts to
            load a copy from the Internet using the URL.</li>

            <li>If it's a file path that starts with "../DTD/",
            JMRI looks in it's local xml/DTD directory for the DTD
            file.</li>

            <li>If the path is just a filename, JMRI looks in it's
            local xml/DTD directory for the DTD file.</li>

            <li>In any other case, e.g. a local or absolute
            pathname, JMRI looks there for the DTD file. Relative
            pathnames are interpreted as starting from the JMRI
            install directory.</li>
          </ul>If the file can't be found, the XML file isn't
          opened. These JMRI versions write just the DTD filename
          in the DOCTYPE line when writing XML files. This provides
          complete backward compatibility with existing files and
          older versions of JMRI back to 1.7.1. At the same time,
          since it can handle HTTP URLs even without an Internet
          connection, it allows us to eventually move forward.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Starting with JMRI 2.9.4, JMRI uses <a href=
      "XmlSchema.shtml">XML schema</a> instead of DTDs, and this
      process is different.</b>
