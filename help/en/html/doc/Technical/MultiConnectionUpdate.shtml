    <h1>JMRI Code: Multi-connection Update</h1>
      This page is a list of hints for adapting systems (jmri.jmrix
      subdirectories) to the new multi-system format.<br>
      It's clearly a work in progress!

      <p>Basically, you have to get all the static variables and
      instance() methods out of the code. In their place, you put
      references to methods of a specific SystemConnectionMemo
      object that carries the references that used to be
      static.</p>

      <p>At the same time, we're doing the Swing pattern update,
      and a couple other minor cleanups on the code.</p>

      <h2>In primary system directory</h2>Create a specific
      subclass of SystemConnectionMemo. This will eventually do all
      the manager initialization, and carry any object references
      that used to be through instance variables.

      <p>Add all that stuff.</p>

      <h3>For each connection method (e.g. each subdirectory)</h3>

      <p>Edit the ConnectionConfig class to take and record a
      reference to a SerialPortAdapter object, and to return it
      from the getAdapter() method. Also, remove the instance()
      method and its implementation.</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace">
    protected void setInstance() { 
        if (adapter == null) {
            adapter = new PR3Adapter();
        }
    }
</pre>

      <p>Edit the adapter class (e.g. PR3Adapter) to remove the
      instance() method and its implementation.</p>

      <p>The configurexml/ConnectionConfigXml class needs to have a
      method added:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace">
    protected void getInstance(Object object) {
        adapter = ((ConnectionConfig)object).getAdapter();
    }
</pre>We should probably refactor this later, but this is the
current form to make sure the correct ConnectionConfig class is
used. We're leaving it unchanged for now to avoid competition with
the serial/network refactoring.

      <p>Also, change this</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace">
    protected void getInstance() {
        adapter = LnHexFilePort.instance();
    }
</pre>to this
      <pre>
    protected void getInstance() {
        adapter = new LnHexFilePort();
    }
</pre>

      <h3>Managers and Beans</h3>For each manager and bean
      combination, you have to update them to no longer use an
      instance() method to access the TrafficController. Passing
      the SystemConectionMemo in to the Manager at construction
      time is the recommended approach, then if need be passing it
      through to the newly created Beans. That passes the prefix
      string, user name for tbe connection, etc.

      <p>The manager must also use the system prefix instead of a
      fixed, single system letter. Using e.g.
      '.startsWith(getSystemPrefix()+"T")' is a good approach.
      Don't just check that the name starts with the prefix because
      e.g. "L" and "L2" are not unambiguous then.</p>

      <h3>Menu</h3>Create a swing subdirectory, if it doesn't exist
      already.

      <p>Put the code for making the menu there, if need be leaving
      a migration subclass behind. (c.f.
      jmri.jmrix.loconet.LocoNetMenu and
      jmri.jmrix.loconet.swing.LocoNetMenu for a template)</p>

      <p>Create a ComponentFactory factory class in the swing
      subpackage that can e.g. create the menu, and eventually the
      trees, etc.</p>

      <p>Edit jmri.jmrix.ActiveSystemsMenu to remove the class;
      menu creation is automatic from now on. (Every time you
      create and register a *SystemConnectionMemo, you also
      register the ComponentFactory)</p>

      <h3>Keep startup actions working</h3>

      <p>To keep things working, it's best to convert to JmriPane
      subclasses. Temporarily, the system connection is then
      created via the use of internal classes, like
      jmri.jmrix.loconet.locomon.LocoMonPane$Default</p>

      <p>This does require people to reset their preferences for
      startup actions, buttons, etc. We're not going to migrate
      those for them.</p>

      <p>To make startup actions work with more than one connection of their type, 
        they should implement the 
        <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/swing/SystemConnectionAction.html">jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionAction</a>
        interface. This will connected them to their specific 
        <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/SystemConnectionMemo.html">SystemConnectionMemo</a>.
