<H1>Integration with CATS</H1>

The Crandic Automated Traffic System (CATS) is a JMRI-based application by 
Rodney Black for controlling and operating a model railroad. 
There's more information on the 
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/">CATS web site</a>.

<p>
JMRI is a library, and CATS is a large, separately maintained application
that uses the library.  As such, CATS provides an important 
reference case for JMRI developers as they extend and adapt their code.
CATS should continue to work for it's users, with a minimum of extranous
effort for the CATS developers!

<H3>Integration for testing</h3>

CATS has two package trees, "cats.*" and "developer.*", roughly
corresponding to the two CATS applications.

<p>
CATS development does not use CVS, and the code is not generally
available while it's being developed.  
Rodney Black periodoically mades releases
available, including source code, as zip-file archives at the
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/">CATS web site</a>.

<p>
Since July 2009, the current CATS distribution works
with JMRI 2.6 and current (2.7.*) test versions.  
From this baseline, we want to keep CATS compiling during
ongoing JMRI development.

<h3>Compiling CATS with JMRI</h3>

(drop directories directly under java/src/; ant will do the rest)

<p>
CATS doesn't have any unit tests, so there's nothing to go in the 
"test" source tree.

<p>
To simplify CVS work, the two CATS directories are ignored...
