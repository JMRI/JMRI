      <h1>JMRI Code: Integration with CATS</h1>
      <p>The Crandic Automated Traffic System (CATS) is a
      JMRI-based application by Rodney Black for
      controlling and operating a model railroad. There's more
      information on the <a href="http://cats4ctc.org/">CATS web
      site</a>.</p>

      <p>JMRI is a library, and CATS is a large, separately
      maintained application that uses the library. As such, CATS
      provides an important reference case for JMRI developers as
      they extend and adapt their code. CATS should continue to
      work for it's users, with a minimum of extraneous effort for
      the CATS developers, even as JMRI changes!</p>

      <h3>Integration for testing</h3>CATS has two package trees,
      "cats.*" and "developer.*", roughly corresponding to the two
      CATS applications.

      <p>CATS development does not use a public code repository,
      and the code is not generally available while it's being
      developed. Rodney Black periodically makes releases
      available, including source code, as zip-file archives at the
      <a href="http://cats4ctc.wikidot.com">CATS web site</a>, see
      the download links at the bottom of the <a href=
      "http://cats4ctc.wikidot.com/main:downloads">CATS license
      page</a>.</p>

      <p>As of early 2016, the current CATS distribution (2038)
      works with JMRI 4.0.1 through to the current (4.3) test
      versions. From this baseline, we want to keep CATS compiling
      during ongoing JMRI development. Changes that break CATS
      should be handled through deprecation, at least for one JMRI
      production release.</p>

      <h3>Compiling CATS with JMRI</h3>Download the CATS source and
      unpack. You'll get a "cats" and "designer" directory.
      (Designer is meant to be independent of JMRI, but we compile
      it together just in case) Depending on how you unpacked, you
      might find those duplicated: cats/cats. Take the lowest level
      "cats" and "designer" directory and move them directly under
      JMRI's java/src directory, i.e. alongside the existing apps
      and jmri directories:
      <pre>
<code>
% ls java/src/<br>META-INF   apps   cats   designer   jmri
</code>
</pre>

      <p>CATS doesn't have any unit tests, so there's nothing to go
      in the "test" source tree.</p>

      <p>The Ant compilation rules will then compile CATS every
      time you compile JMRI itself. This will show you errors,
      deprecation warnings, etc.</p>

      <p>To simplify JMRI repository work, the two CATS-related
      directories are ignored when doing repository operations.</p>

      <p>Note that this does include the CATS source within the
      build, so any jar files you create will also include CATS.
      Don't use jar files from a build like this for JMRI-only
      purposes.</p>

      <p>JMRI itself has lots of deprecation warnings, so if you
      want to see just the CATS ones:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>ant clean compile</li>

        <li>rm -rf target/classes/cats target/classes/designer</li>

        <li>ant -Ddeprecation="on" compile</li>
      </ul>The first compilation will compile everything. The
      second one will only compile the CATS source, so will only
      give you warnings from those classes.

      <h3>Running CATS from a local JMRI build</h3>Download the
      most recent CATS release from the bottom of the <a href=
      "http://cats4ctc.wikidot.com/main:downloads">CATS license
      page</a>. As of this writing (Feb 2016), that was the
      "<a href=
      "http://cats4ctc.wikidot.com/local--files/main:downloads/release2038.zip">CATS
      and designer package (compatible with JMRI 4.0.1 to latest -
      2.53 MB)</a>" link which gives version 2038 of CATS.

      <p>Move the contents, including the startup scripts
      "cats.csh" (Linux, Mac OS X) and "cats.bat" (Windows) and
      other related files, into your top-level JMRI directory.</p>

      <p>If you've compiled CATS locally, you don't need the
      cats.jar or designer.jar files.</p>

      <p>Then just execute the appropriate "cats.csh" (Linux, Mac
      OS X) and "cats.bat" (Windows) script.</p>
