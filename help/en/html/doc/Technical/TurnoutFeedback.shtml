      <h1>JMRI: Turnout Feedback</h1>
      Model railroaders want
      different things when it comes to knowing the status of the
      turnouts on their layout. Some are quite happy to say "I told
      it to move, that's good enough for me". These people don't
      worry about whether a turnout on their layout actually moved
      when they told it to. Those people can just ignore this page,
      and leave the JMRI settings at their default.

      <p>But some modelers want to have better information about
      the status of the turnouts on their layout, and so use some
      form of "feedback" to indicate turnout position. This could
      be as complicated as two microswitches, adjusted to only
      close when the turnout is properly seated in either position.
      Or it could be something simpler.</p>

      <p>In the code, Turnout objects actually know about two
      different states: "Commanded" state and "Known" state. The
      commanded state is "This is what was asked for last". The
      known state is "This is what's actually correct on the layout
      as far as I know".</p>

      <p>Built into into LocoNet and XPressNet are limited
      abilities to monitor what is happening on their networks and
      adapt to messages about Turnout state changes.
      The NCE Powerhouse Pro (only) can monitor the last known state
      of any turnout that it changed (on request from a cab, macro,
      JMRI or Mini Panel). All the other protocols
      normally use a "you told it to change, so it did" logic. In
      other words, when something in the code (the Turnout Tool or
      a script) commands a state change from closed to thrown, the
      default is for both both the commanded state and the known
      state to change to "thrown".</p>

      <p>But it is also possible to control this in more detail if
      you have wired your layout to allow it.</p>

      <p>The whole question of turnout feedback is then "How do we
      configure the program to understand the known state properly,
      given my layout hardware?"</p>

      <p>If you go to the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout
      Table</a> tool, you'll find it has four columns associated
      with feedback:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>"Feedback"</dt>

        <dd>This is the "known state". You can't change it, but
        this column will show you what the program thinks it
        is.</dd>

        <dt>"Mode"</dt>

        <dd>This is the feedback method used by this turnout. (You
        can change it for each turnout individually, but note the
        change doesn't take effect until you click somewhere else,
        and you might need to add some sensor names in the next
        column(s))</dd>

        <dt>"Sensor 1", "Sensor 2"</dt>

        <dd>These define the sensors needed by certain types of
        feedback. You can type a sensor number, system name or user
        name here; the program will change it to the system name
        that it needs.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Available feedback modes are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>DIRECT</dt>

        <dd>The default in many cases, and also the original
        behavior of the program. When something tells the turnout
        to change, it's just immediately assumed that it actually
        did it.</dd>

        <dt>ONESENSOR</dt>

        <dd>The turnout watches the sensor defined by the "Sensor
        1" column, which is probably hooked to a microswitch on the
        turnout or similar. When the sensor is Active, the turnout
        is known to be in the "Thrown" position. When it's
        Inactive, the turnout is known to be in the "Closed"
        position.</dd>

        <dt>TWOSENSOR</dt>

        <dd>The turnout watches two sensors defined by the "Sensor
        1" and "Sensor 2" columns, which are probably hooked to
        microswitches at either end of the turnout's throw bar.
        When Sensor 1 is active, the turnout is known to be thrown.
        When Sensor 2 is active, the turnout is known to be closed
        (normal).</dd>

        <dt>DELAYED</dt>

        <dd>When something tells the Turnout to change, 
        it immediately starts the operation and goes to
        the INCONSISTENT state to reflect that the points
        are moving.  After a few seconds delay, the
        operation completes and the final state is reported.</dd>

        <dt>MONITORING</dt>

        <dd>Default for LocoNet and XPressNet turnouts, this means the
        network is monitored for
        messages about the status of the turnout. This mode is only
        available for certain protocols, i.e. some protocols can't
        do the monitoring properly, and don't have this
        choice.
        <br>If selected for the NCE Powerhouse Pro (only), it will monitor
        the last known state change of this turnout made by the command station
        (on request from a cab, macro, JMRI or Mini Panel).</dd>

        <dt>INDIRECT</dt>

        <dd>Currently only available for LocoNet turnouts, this
        informs the program that the turnout is being driven by a
        Digitrax DS54 with a microswitch attached to the switch
        lead. For more information, see the <a href=
        "../../hardware/loconet/DS54.shtml">DS54 page</a>.</dd>

        <dt>EXACT</dt>

        <dd>Currently only available for LocoNet and XPressNet
        turnouts. For LocoNet turnouts, this informs the program
        that the turnout is being driven by a Digitrax DS54 with
        two microswitches attached to the switch and aux leads. For
        more information, see the <a href=
        "../../hardware/loconet/DS54.shtml">DS54 page</a>. For
        XPressNet turnouts, this informs the program that the
        turnout is being driven by an LS100 and the feedback inputs
        have been connected as described in the <a href=
        "http://www.lenz.com/manuals/accessorydecoders/ls100110.pdf">
        LS100 manual (external link, PDF)</a>.</dd>
        
        <dt>SIGNAL</dt>

        <dd>Recommended setting for Signal Mast controled by driver
        Matrix output with XpressNet. The program does not wait
        for turnout feedback and sends matrix commands as soon
        as possible.</dd>

      </dl>

      <p>Most people will (and probably should!!!) stick with the
      default feedback type that the software selects for them.</p>

      <h2>Operation</h2>When feedback is used, Turnouts can start
      to behave in complicated ways.

      <h3>Simplest Case</h3>The most common case is JMRI commanding
      turnouts to move, and they move properly. The sequence is
      then:

      <ol>
        <li>JMRI commands the Turnout to move by setting the
        commanded state to e.g. THROWN.</li>

        <li>The Turnout object figures out the right commands to
        send to the layout hardware, and works with the rest of the
        program to do that.</li>

        <li>The position changes on the layout.</li>
      </ol>If no feedback (really, DIRECT feedback) is in use, the
      known state of the turnout will also change in step 1. At
      that point, icons on panels, signal logic, etc will all be
      notified of the change and react.

      <h3>Simple Layout Feedback</h3>The simplest case for using
      feedback from a microswitch on the layout is similar:

      <ol>
        <li>JMRI commands the Turnout to move by setting the
        commanded state to e.g. THROWN.</li>

        <li>The Turnout object figures out the right commands to
        send to the layout hardware, and works with the rest of the
        program to do that.</li>

        <li>The position changes on the layout.</li>

        <li>A microswitch detects that position change, and informs
        the layout electronics, which in turn changes an input to
        JMRI.</li>

        <li>That input is connected to a JMRI Sensor object, which
        changes its state e.g. from INACTIVE to ACTIVE.</li>

        <li>Because the Turnout is watching that Sensor for
        ONESENSOR feedback, when the change occurs it sets the
        known state of the turnout to THROWN.</li>
      </ol>This sequence takes a little time, but the known state
      of the Turnout isn't changed until the points have actually
      moved on the layout. Then, icons on panels, signal logic, etc
      will all be notified of the change in known state and react.

      <h3>Uncommanded changes on the layout</h3>Feedback allows
      JMRI to detect that something has changed due to action on
      the layout, instead of a command from the program. For
      example, if you're using feedback from a turnout, you might
      see something like this sequence:

      <ol>
        <li>The program sets the commanded state to THROWN, and
        instructions go out to the turnout telling it to move to
        that position.</li>

        <li>Later, the feedback information comes back to indicate
        that the movement has taken place. This sets the known
        state in JMRI to THROWN.</li>

        <li>Later, and independently, you move the turnout on the
        layout to the CLOSED position, perhaps with a ground throw
        or local pushbutton.</li>

        <li>This causes the feedback information sent to JMRI to
        change.</li>

        <li>Because of this, the known state is changed to
        CLOSED.</li>

        <li>At this point, JMRI makes the assumption that you
        wanted this to happen; in effect, a command was given on
        the layout (not in the program) to move the turnout. So
        JMRI changes the commanded state to CLOSED also.</li>
      </ol>Note that this last transition in commanded state does
      not send commands to the layout; it's just a change within
      the program.

      <h3>TWOSENSOR feedback and inconsistent state</h3>TWOSENSOR
      feedback uses two separate sensors to indicate when the
      turnout has successfully gone to CLOSED and THROWN state.
      During the transition between those two, it's in neither
      state, so the turnout state appears as INCONSISTENT. For
      example:

      <ol>
        <li>The turnout is currently showing CLOSED, with the
        closed-sensing Sensor showing active and the thrown-sensing
        Sensor showing inactive.</li>

        <li>You command the turnout to move, and it starts
        moving.</li>

        <li>The closed-sensing Sensor going inactive as the points
        lift off, and the turnout starts to show INCONSISTENT.</li>

        <li>The thrown-sensing Sensor goes Active as the points
        settle on closed, and the Turnout will start to show
        Closed.</li>
      </ol>The same happens if you remotely start the turnout
      moving, for example with a local push-button.

      <ol>
        <li>The turnout starts to move</li>

        <li>The sensor indicates that by going inactive, and the
        turnout shows INCONSISTENT</li>

        <li>The other sensor sees the turnout settle into place,
        and the final state is shown.</li>

        <li>JMRI thinks you must have done that intentionally, and
        sets the commanded state equal to the feedback state.</li>
      </ol>(N.b.: Sometimes the mechanical linkages are not
      perfect, and the "to" sensor will go Active before the "from
      sensor goes Inactive. The program handles this the same way:
      It will show INCONSISTENT if either both sensors are Active,
      or both Inactive)

      <h3>Bus-based systems and input messages</h3>Some DCC
      systems, e.g. LocoNet, XPressNet and NCE systems, can handle
      commands to turnouts from multiple sources. When set to
      MONITORING feedback, JMRI looks for those for confirmation of
      the proper state of the turnout: Seeing the message sent is
      considered confirmation that the turnout has changed.

      <p>With MONITORING set, when something outside of JMRI (e.g.
      another program; a handheld throttle) changes the turnout
      state, JMRI will accept that and change its internal state
      for the turnout.</p>
