    <h1>JMRI Code: Static Analysis with SpotBugs</h1>
        SpotBugs is a
        tool that can examine code to find possible problems. It does
      a "static analysis", looking through the code to find certain
      "known bad ideas": Things that are likely to cause
      occasional/intermittent problems, poor performance, etc.
      Because those kinds of problems are hard to find with tests,
      finding them by inspection is often the only realistic
      approach. Having a tool that can do those inspections
      automatically, so that they can be done every time something
      is changed, keeps the code from slowly getting worse and
      worse without anybody noticing until it's too late.

        <a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/SpotBugs/">
            <img src="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/SpotBugs/findbugs/trendGraph/png?url=PRIORITY" align="right"/></a>
      <p>For more information on SpotBugs, see <a href=
                                                  "https://spotbugs.github.io">the SpotBugs home
              page</a>.</p>

      <p>We routinely run SpotBugs as part of our 
      <a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml">continuous integration process</a>. 
      You can see the 
      <a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/SpotBugs/lastBuild/findbugsResult/">detailed results of the most recent (daily) run</a>
      along with 
      <a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/SpotBugs/">recent progress trend</a>
      online.</p>

      <p>If SpotBugs is finding a false positive, a bug that's not
          really a bug, you can turn it off with an annotation such
      as:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
import edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations;
@SuppressFBWarnings("FE_FLOATING_POINT_EQUALITY", "Even tiny differences should trigger update")
</pre>
      Although Java
      itself considers it optional, we require the second "justification"
      argument. Explaining why you've added this annotation to suppress a
      message will help whoever comes after you and is trying to
      understand the code. It will also help make sure you properly
      understand the cause of the underlying bug report: Sometimes what
      seems a false positive really isn't. Annotations without a
      justification clause will periodically be removed.
      Note that the @SuppressFBWarnings contents in this form should be all on one line
      so that automated scanners can more reliably see it. 

      <p>For clarity, this annotation also supports a form that lets you be more verbose:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressFBWarnings(value = "FE_FLOATING_POINT_EQUALITY", 
        justification = "OK to compare floats, as even tiny differences should trigger update")
</pre>
    This can make it easier to see what is what when quickly
scanning through the code.
      <p>If you need to put more than one message type in an
      annotation, use array syntax:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressFBWarnings("{type1},{type2}","why both are needed")
</pre>

      <p>There are also Java and SpotBugs annotations that can help
          it better understand your code. Sometimes they'll give it
      enough understanding of e.g. when a variable can be null,
      that it'll no longer make false-positive mistakes. For more
      on this, see the <a href=
      "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/">Java
      annotations</a> and <a href=
             "http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/annotations.html">SpotBugs
          annotation pages</a>.</p>

      <p>The basics of annotations are covered in a <a href=
      "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/">Java
      annotations tutorial</a>.</p>

      <a name="annotations" id="annotations" />
      <p>It can be useful to mark code with one of the following
          annotations so that SpotBugs does a good job of reasoning
          about it:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href=
        "http://static.javadoc.io/com.google.code.findbugs/jsr305/3.0.1/javax/annotation/Nonnull.html">
        <code>javax.annotation.Nonnull</code></a> - The annotated
        element must not be null. Annotated fields must not be null
        after construction has completed. Annotated methods must
        have non-null return values. Use
        <a href="http://static.javadoc.io/com.google.code.findbugs/jsr305/3.0.1/javax/annotation/ParametersAreNonnullByDefault.html">javax.annotation.ParametersAreNonnullByDefault</a>
        on the class declaration (the start of the class)
        to set @Nonnull for an entire class.
        Note that SpotBugs won't let you compare an @Nonnull value to
        null; that's an error that SpotBugs wants to find via static analysis.
        If your annotating a part of the external API, and you want to double-check at runtime, use 
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Objects.html#requireNonNull-T-">java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(..)</a>,
        for example:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        public Car(@Nonnull Engine engine, @Nonnull Transmission transmission) {
            this.engine = java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(engine, "Engine cannot be null");
            this.transmission = java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(transmission, "Transmission cannot be null");
        }
</pre>
   
        </li>

        <li><a href=
        "http://static.javadoc.io/com.google.code.findbugs/jsr305/3.0.1/javax/annotation/CheckForNull.html">
        <code>javax.annotation.CheckForNull</code></a> - the
        annotated variable, parameter or return value may have a
        null value, so all uses should appropriately handle that.
        Please put this on method definitions to say that the
        return value should be checked for null.</li>

        <li>
          <a href=
          "http://static.javadoc.io/com.google.code.findbugs/jsr305/3.0.1/javax/annotation/OverridingMethodsMustInvokeSuper.html">
          <code>javax.annotation.OverridingMethodsMustInvokeSuper</code></a>
          - Used to annotate a method that, if overridden, must (or
          should) be invoke super in the overriding method.
          Examples of such methods include finalize() and clone().

          <p>Note this replaces the deprecated <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/annotations.html">
                  <code>edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.OverrideMustInvoke</code></a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li><a href=
        "http://static.javadoc.io/com.google.code.findbugs/jsr305/3.0.1/javax/annotation/CheckReturnValue.html">
        <code>javax.annotation.CheckReturnValue</code></a> -
        annotates a method to say the method has no side-effects,
        so there's no point in calling it without checking its
        return value.</li>

        <li><a href=
        "http://jcip.net/annotations/doc/net/jcip/annotations/Immutable.html">
        <code>net.jcip.annotations.Immutable</code></a> - An object
        of this class can't be changed after it's created. This
        allows both better checking of logic, and also simplifies
        use by your colleagues, so it's good to create classes that
        have this property and then annotate them.</li>

        <li><a href=
        "http://jcip.net/annotations/doc/net/jcip/annotations/NotThreadSafe.html">
        <code>net.jcip.annotations.NotThreadSafe</code></a> - a
        class that isn't thread-safe, so shouldn't be checked for
        concurrency issues. Often used for Swing-based classes, but
        note that some Swing components (e.g. monitor windows,
        classes with listeners) do have to accept input from other
        threads.</li>

        <li><a href=
        "http://jcip.net/annotations/doc/net/jcip/annotations/ThreadSafe.html">
        <code>net.jcip.annotations.ThreadSafe</code></a> - classes
        that do have to be usable for multiple threads. SpotBugs
        generally assumes this, but it's good to put it on a class
        that's intended to be thread-safe as a reminder to future
        developers.</li>

        <li><a href=
        "http://jcip.net/annotations/doc/net/jcip/annotations/GuardedBy.html">
        <code>net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy</code></a> - 
        "The field or method to which this annotation is applied can only be accessed 
        when holding a particular lock, which may be a built-in (synchronization) lock, 
        or may be an explicit java.util.concurrent.Lock."
        <p>
        Your code should ensure that the synchronization is done
        around references to the annotated field or method.
        SpotBugs will (sometimes) check that.
        </li>
        
        
      </ul>For more information about these annotations, please see
      links above and

      <ul>
        <li>The JSR-305 <a href=
        "http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.findbugs/jsr305/3.0.1">
        code annotations page</a>,</li>

        <li>the <a href=
        "http://jcip.net/annotations/doc/index.html">Concurrency
        API annotations page</a>, and</li>

        <li>for some older information, the <a href=
                                               "http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/annotations.html">SpotBugs
                annotation page</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not use these annotations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href=
               "http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/annotations.html"><code>
                    javax.annotation.Nullable</code></a> - This doesn't really
        mean what people think it does, as SpotBugs doesn't really
        check anything when this is used. From the SpotBugs documentation:
        <blockquote>
              SpotBugs will treat the annotated items as though they had
              no annotation. In practice this annotation is useful only
            for overriding an overarching NonNull annotation. Use
            javax.annotation.ParametersAreNullableByDefault to set it
            for an entire class. Prefer the use of
            <code>CheckForNull</code>.
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Running SpotBugs</h3>
      
      SpotBugs is automatically run by 
      <a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml#travis">Travis CI</a> as part of the 
      <a href="gitdeveloper.shtml">Pull Request</a>
      process, and by 
      <a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml#jenkins">Jenkins</a>
      as part of the 
      <a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/SpotBugs/lastBuild/findbugsResult/">daily builds</a>.
      If new errors appear during CI, the job will (usually) fail.  You can look at
      the Jenkins output to see where there are existing errors to work on.
      
      <p>
      To run it locally:
      <ul>
      <li>Install a local copy of SpotBugs. There
        are multiple ways to do this, see the
        <a href="https://spotbugs.github.io">SpotBugs web site</a>.
      <li>You have to tell the JMRI build systems where that installation
        is.  You can do that with various environment variables, etc, 
        but the most straight-forward is to add a line like the 
        following to your 
        <a href="StartUpScripts.shtml">local.properties</a> file:
    <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    spotbugs.home = /Users/jake/.spotbugs/spotbugs-3.1.7
    </pre>
      <li>Then run SpotBugs in ant via:
    <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    ant spotbugs
    </pre>
    which will create a <code>spotbugs.html</code> 
    file that you can open in a browser.
    </ul>
    
    The <code>ant spotbugs-ci</code> target is similar,
    except it creates the output as a 
    <code>spotbugs.xml</code> XML file that 
    Jenkins uses to track which items have been fixed, etc.
    <p>
    The
    <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/.spotbugs.xml">.spotbugs.xml</a> 
    file specifies which items in
    SpotBugs reports are suppressed for the JMRI project's 
    <a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/SpotBugs/lastBuild/findbugsResult/">usual reporting via Jenkins</a>. 
    The
    <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/.spotbugs-check.xml">.spotbugs-check.xml</a> 
    file is a super-set which identifies which are significant enough to fail CI.
    (This is specified two places in the <code>pom.xml</code>, which is 
    used by the <code>scripts/travis.sh</code> to control Maven running, which
    in turn is used by the <code>.travis.yml</code> file as the Travis run-time script)
    

      <h3>Background</h3>

      <p>Simon White added FindBugs support to our Ant-based build
      chain during the development of JMRI 2.5.5.</p>

      <h4>Suppressed Warnings</h4>
      We have turned off the routine
      SpotBugs checking of certain kinds of conditions:

      <dl>
        <dt><a href=
               "http://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#ri-class-implements-same-interface-as-superclass-ri-redundant-interfaces">
                RI_REDUNDANT_INTERFACES</a></dt>

        <dd>This flags cases where a class implements an interface,
        and also inherits from a superclass that already implements
        that interface. This is redundant and untidy, but it can't
        cause the code to malfunction. We have enough of them that
        we've turned off the warning, and will come back to it some
        later time.</dd>

        <dt><a href=
               "http://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#sic-could-be-refactored-into-a-named-static-inner-class-sic-inner-should-be-static-anon">
                SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON</a>, <a href=
                    "http://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#sic-could-be-refactored-into-a-static-inner-class-sic-inner-should-be-static-needs-this">
                    SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_NEEDS_THIS</a></dt>

        <dd>Static, as opposed to non-static, inner classes
        (classes defined within another class) take less space
        because they don't maintain references to the containing
        object. This warning suggests moving an anonymous (defined
        in-line to the code) inner class to a regular (defined not
        in-line) class so it can be made static. Although probably
        a small improvement, it's a bit of work for a small
        improvement. We have enough of them that we've turned off
        the warning, and will come back to it some later time.</dd>

        <dt>
            <a href="https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#dm-consider-using-locale-parameterized-version-of-invoked-method-dm-convert-case">DM_CONVERT_CASE</a>,
            <a href="https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#dm-reliance-on-default-encoding-dm-default-encoding">DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING</a>,
            </dt>

        <dd>These cover aspects of handling characters in non-Western
        languages. Most of our String handling doesn't have anything to do
        with this, so it would be a huge number of annotations for
        only a small amount of I18N gain.  Perhaps we'll revisit these
        later.</dd>

        <dt>Malicious Code</dt>

        <dd>This is a class of warnings centered around the idea
        that data and code methods shouldn't be too visible,
        especially when static. This is true, but JMRI isn't a
        hardened library that's being released into a world of
        people trying to break it, as these changes are a lower
        priority.</dd>

        <dt>Se,SvVI</dt>

        <dd>This is a large class of warnings associated with Java
        serialization. JMRI doesn't used serialization, and is
        unlikely to do so in the future, so we suppress these to
        raise the average quality of the issued warnings.</dd>
      </dl>

     <h4>Status and Counts</h4>
      <p>We've been making slow but continuous progress on removing these:</p>

      </table>

      <p>A lot of work has gone into JMRI
      cycle to bring the bug count down. The <a href=
      "ContinuousIntegration.shtml">Continuous Integration
          server</a> runs SpotBugs twice a day, which helps developers
      see the results of their coding without having to set up to
      run SpotBugs themselves.</p>

      <p>If you are checking code in to the JMRI repository, please
      check the CI server and make sure that your changes do not
      introduce new errors.</p>
