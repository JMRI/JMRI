      <h1>JMRI Code: Getting the OLD CVS Code (Archived)</h1>

      <h2>This page is kept for historical purposes only!</h2>

      <p class="important">JMRI has migrated away from CVS for version control to
      <a href="getsvncode.shtml">SVN</a> in July 2011, and on to
      Git in September 2015. For access to the current JMRI source
      code, please see the <a href="getgitcode.shtml">Git
      repository</a> page.</p>

      <p>JMRI release 2.12 (and earlier) were made from CVS, and to
      access that source code, you should use the detailed
      instructions below.</p>

      <h2>Quick Start</h2>

      <p>You can download the JMRI source code via CVS using:</p>
      <pre>
<code>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri login
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri co all 
</code>
</pre>(If asked for a password, just hit return)

      <h2>Details</h2>

      <p>Our source code up to JMRI version 2.12 was distributed
      using CVS. (We also kept the <a href="WebSite.shtml">web
      site</a> in CVS, if you'd like to work with it directly.) If
      you want to work with the code, a few minutes installing CVS
      is well worth it. We're sorry, but we just can't support
      other methods (sending .zip files, etc), as they're just too
      error prone.</p>

      <p>Many computers come with CVS installed, including Linux
      and Mac OS X. If you're using Windows, you will need to
      install a CVS "client" program like <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10072&amp;release_id=24467">
      WinCVS</a>. A recent version can be downloaded from: <a href=
      "http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip</a>.</p>

      <p>To get a copy of the source for your own use, you can use
      "anonymous checkout". For a command line cvs client, make a
      new directory for the project, change to it, and tell CVS you
      exist with</p>
      <pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri login
</pre>This "login" line is only needed once; after that, it is
remembered on your local machine. You may be asked for a password.
If so, just hit return, as the empty password will be accepted. You
can then get a copy of the code with
      <pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri co all
</pre>

      <p>If you're using a GUI-based client like WinCVS, pull down
      the "admin" menu and select "command line" to get a place to
      type these commands. On other computers, you can type them
      directly on the command line.</p>

      <p>If you have an existing copy of the code and want to
      update it to the most recent contents of CVS, the second
      command is:</p>
      <pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri -q update -dA
</pre>

      <p>See also the <a href="CVSFAQ.shtml">CVS FAQ page</a>.</p>

      <p>After the checkout is complete, you'll find directories
      called "xml", "resources", "jython", "help", "lib", "java"
      and others. Change to the "java" directory. There, you will
      find a "src" directory that contains the source code for JMRI
      itself, and a "tests" directory that contains various test
      routines.</p>

      <p>You can look at the code with your favorite text editor.
      To compile and run it, you need one of the compilation tools
      described on the bar at the left.</p>

      <p>Once you're working with the code, you'll probably create
      some improvements you'd like to contribute back to the
      project. This is where CVS has tremendous advantages; with
      the appropriate permissions and commands, you can merge your
      changes back into the common source automagically. Contact us
      when you're ready to do that or see the <a href=
      "index.shtml#contributing">info on contributing</a>.</p>

      <h2>Windows Details</h2>

      <p>Getting and updating the code with tortoisecvs</p>

      <p>To get a initial checkout from CVS for your own use after
      installing http://www.tortoisecvs.org/. Make a new directory
      for the project, by creating a folder named "JMRISourceCode".
      Right Click (control-click) on that folder and select CVS CVS
      Checkout". In the pane that opens for the CVSROOT enter</p>
      <pre>
<code>&lt;:pserver:jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri&gt;</code>
</pre>For the Server enter
      <pre>
<code>&lt; jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net&gt;</code>
</pre>On the lower right of the screen is a "Fetch List" button.
Click that and a list will appear, click on the 'all' line. Then
Click "OK" on the bottom of the pane. A new pane will open and the
files will be downloaded; at the bottom of that pane is a check box
called "Close on Completion", check it. When the pane closes, the
folder you created will have folders inside it with all the JMRI
files.

      <p>Once you have performed the initial checkout from CVS in
      your local folder, to update them select all of them and then
      Right Click and select "CVS Update". You can also just update
      a single folder by selecting it, etc.</p>
