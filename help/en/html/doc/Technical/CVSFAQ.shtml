    <h1>JMRI Code: CVS FAQ</h1>
      <p>This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions for CVS,
      particularly regarding how we use it with JMRI.</p>

      <p class="important">Note: JMRI code is not maintained in CVS any more. To
      get the current code, please see the help pages on <a href=
      "getgitcode.shtml">Accessing the code via the Git
      repository.</a></p>

      <p>See also the <a href="index.shtml">Technical index</a> for
      more information on maintaining JMRI code. <a name="cvstool"
      id="cvstool"></a></p>

      <h3>How do I get a copy of CVS?</h3>Many computers come with
      CVS installed, including Linux and Mac OS X. If you're using
      Windows, you will need to install a CVS "client" program like
      <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10072&amp;release_id=24467">
      WinCVS</a>. A recent version can be downloaded from: <a href=
      "http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip</a>.
      <a name="jmrisource" id="jmrisource"></a>

      <h3>How can I get my own copy of the JMRI code?</h3>To get a
      copy of the source for your own use, you can use "anonymous
      checkout". For a command line cvs client, make a new
      directory for the project, change to it, and tell CVS you
      exist with
      <pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri login
</pre>This "login" line is only needed once; after that, it is
remembered on your local machine. You may be asked for a password.
If so, just hit return, as the empty password will be accepted. You
can then get a copy of the code with
      <pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri co all
</pre>

      <p>If you're using a GUI-based client like WinCVS, pull down
      the "admin" menu and select "command line" to get a place to
      type these commands. On other computers, you can type them
      directly on the command line. <a name="update" id=
      "update"></a></p>

      <h3>How can I bring my copy of the JMRI code up to
      date?</h3>People contribute updates to the JMRI code almost
      every week. Your local copy doesn't get these changes until
      you ask for them, so that you've got something stable to work
      with. If you have an existing copy of the code and want to
      update it to the most recent contents of CVS, the CVS command
      is:
      <pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri -q update -dA
</pre>The "-q" option suppresses a lot of routine messages. The
"-d" option is needed to tell CVS to also bring in new directories.
The "-A" option, here combined with "-d", means you want the most
recent contents. <a name="release" id="release"></a>

      <h3>How can I get the code for a particular release?</h3>CVS
      uses "tags" to make specific sets of content. We use these to
      mark the code for each release as we build it. To get the
      code for a release, you can ask for it with a command like
      this:
      <pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jmri.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri -q co -rRelease-2-1-5
</pre>In this example, "Release-2-1-5" is the tag for the 2.1.5
release. You can adjust that as needed. If you already have a
release checked out and want to update it to a specific release,
change the "co" command to "update -d"

      <h3><a name="refid" id="refid">What are those lines like
      <i>$Revision$</i> and <i>$Id$</i>?</a></h3>Those are
      automatically updated by CVS every time a new version of the
      file is checked-in to the repository. Please don't edit
      them!!! If you contribute your changes to the project, those
      line have to be intact in the contributed file.

      <h3><a name="update1" id="update1">How do I update an existing
      copy of the source to the current version?</a></h3>As the
      common code changes, you might want to update your copy to
      contain the lastest version. To do that, use:
      <pre>
cvs -q update
</pre>Any changes will be merged into the files on your disk, and
you should then be up-to-date with your own changes still present.

      <p>The "-q" option removes a lot of informational messages as
      CVS enters the various directories in the project; the
      command still works if you omit it, but it will be harder to
      see any real error messages.</p>

      <h3><a name="ds_store" id="ds_store">What are these messages
      about .DS_Store files?</a></h3>If you're using Mac OS X, CVS
      may give you messages about ".DS_Store" files. These are used
      to keep track of window layouts, etc. To suppress these
      messages, just create a file in your home directory called
      ".cvsignore" and add a line of ".DS_Store" to it (no quotes).
      CVS will then ignore all .DS_Store files in all of your
      checked-out directory trees.

      <h3><a name="tags" id="tags">What is the convention for tag
      names?</a></h3>Typically, three types of tag names are used:

      <ol>
        <li>"Release-1-5-4" - the tag defining a specific released
        version of the code. These are created during the release
        builds, and should not be changed.</li>

        <li>"Release-1-5-4-branch" - this is the branch-tag
        defining a "patch branch" for a specific release. This is
        the only use we make of CVS branches; please note that we
        do not use branches for normal development.</li>

        <li>"rgj20050603a" - of the form "initials" "date" "some
        letter", these can be used by individual developers to keep
        track of what they're doing. All we ask is that you start a
        tag with your initials.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3><a name="structure" id="structure">How is JMRI stored in
      CVS?</a></h3>JMRI consists
      of two large code trees, and a number of auxiliary
      directories. The code is divided into "jmri", the main JMRI
      code, and "test", the set of automated tests. These are kept
      separate so that it's easy to build just the distributed
      software, without including the test code. (If you directly
      look at the CVS repository, you'll also see "jmrit" and
      "jmrix" directories; these are obsolete, and kept only for
      historical reasons.)

      <p>Similarly, auxilary information is kept in separate "lib",
      "xml", "resources", "jython", etc. directories.</p>

      <p>Finally, there's a bunch of information that's not part of
      the application development areas, including the "scripts"
      directory of tools for building releases, the web site, and
      others.</p>

      <p>We store all these separately in CVS so that you can check
      out just the ones you need.</p>

      <p>To simplify checking out a development tree, we provide a
      CVS module named "all". This checks out the necessary
      directories and puts them in the required places for a
      straight-forward build.</p>

      <h3><a name="lcok" id="lcok">Some files appear to be
      read-only, why is that?</a></h3>As
      the software evolves, sometimes files become obsolete. If
      they're not needed at all, CVS allows us to delete them from
      future releases. In that case, they don't show up at all when
      you check out a current copy.

      <p>But sometimes the file needs to remain, but we don't want
      it to be modified any more. For example, an older schema or
      DTD file needs to remain around so that older references to
      it continue to work, but we don't want somebody accidentally
      modifying the older version instead of the current version of
      the file.</p>

      <p>In cases like that, we use the "cvs watch on" option to
      effectively lock the file. The checked-out version of the
      file is write-protected so you can't edit it without noticing
      the problem, and changes can't be checked back into CVS
      unless the file watch is turned off.</p>
