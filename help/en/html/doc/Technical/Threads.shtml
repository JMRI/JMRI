      <h1>JMRI: Threading</h1>
      
      The vast majority of JMRI code (and
      programmers) don't have to worry about threading. Their code
      gets invoked, and invokes other code, and threading takes
      care of itself. This is particularly true of event-based
      code, which responds to events from e.g. the GUI or a layout
      object changing, and calls methods on other objects, which
      may in turn create more events.

      <p>This simplicity comes from using a single thread for
      processing most of JMRI's activity: The Java Swing event
      thread.</p>

      <p>Note that this does <em>not</em> mean that other things
      can't be happening. For example, this script fragment:</p>

<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    state = sensors.provideSensor("mySensor").getState()<br>
    turnouts.provideTurnout("myTurnout").setState(THROWN)<br>
    print state == sensors.provideSensor("mySensor").getState()<br>
</pre>
    can print either true or false, because changing that turnout
    <em>can</em> change associated sensors instantaneously.

      <p>There are times when you might want to do something a bit
      more complex using an additional thread:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You might want to put long-running processing in a
        separate thread to keep the rest of JMRI responsive.</li>

        <li>The easiest way to code a state machine that talks to
        layout hardware might be to use a separate thread.</li>

        <li>You might be interfacing to some other existing code
        that uses threads.</li>
      </ul>
      
      We would prefer that you handle the threading issues
      that arise in that case via the 
      <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/ThreadingUtil.html">jmri.util.ThreadingUtil</a>
      class. ThreadingUtil provides utilities that make it easy to
      invoke needed functions on the right thread.

      <p>For example, if you want to read a bunch of data from a
      file, spend some time munging it, and then create a window to
      present it all, you might want to do all that work on a
      separate thread. At the end, when it's time to set your new
      frame visible, you have to to that on the Swing (GUI) thread.
      Here's the code to do that:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    frame = new JmriJFrame();  // frame declared as instance variable<br>
    // spend a long time reading data and configuring the frame<br>
    ThreadingUtil.runOnGUI( ()-&gt;{  frame.setVisible(); });<br>
</pre>
        ThreadingUtil separates operations on the GUI (e.g. Java
        Swing) thread, and operations on the Layout (e.g. Sensors,
        Turnouts, etc) thread. There's no real difference now, but in the
        interest of perhaps someday needing to separate those, we've
        introduced the two versions now. Please try to pick the
        mostly-likely-right one when coding.

      <p>(N.B.: You'll find lots of older cases that use explicitly
      use javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(r) or
      javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(r); these should be
      migrated to the newer JMRI-specific methods as time is
      available to keep our code just a tiny bit cleaner and more
      flexible.) 
  
<h3>Ending Threads</h3>

    This is really about interrupt() and our use of it.
    
    <p>
    Bottom line recommendation:  <em>Never</em> swallow <code>InterruptedException</code>!
    If you call a method that throws it, your choices are (from best to worst):
    <ol>
    <li>InterruptedException means your operation has been interrupted:  Some other 
        piece of code has <em>deliberately</em> asked your operation to end.
        This is not an error, and shouldn't be treated as one.  If you can, 
        terminate what the code is doing and return to normal operation.
    <li>If you can't reliably terminate whatever is being done, perhaps because you're 
        code is a low-level part, Just pass the InterruptedException up:  
        Don't <code>catch</code> it, just have your method says that it
        <code>throws InterruptedException</code>.
    <li>Sometimes you can't change the signature of your method: Perhaps it's overriding a
        Java definition by inheritance. Only if you can't terminate cleanly or pass it up,
        you can mark the interrupt and continue:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        try {
            wait()
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
</pre>
        This will let execution continue, as if you hadn't received the interrupt, but 
        the <em>next</em> that execution hits a blocking call, that call will 
        immediately get an interrupt too. Perhaps it can handle it better!
    </ol>

    Using a

    from the 
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html">java.util.concurrent</a>
    package can remove the need to mess with thread synchronization and locking.
    That can be a huge win!

    It also includes a BlockingQueue example.

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<h3>Getting a thread-dump</h3>

When debugging threading issues, it can be helpful to get a "thread dump".
<ul>
<li>To do this on Linux and macOS when running from a command line, type control-backspace
<li>To do this on Linux and macOS when running detached, e.g. from startup icon, 
    <ul>
    <li>Get the process ID (PID) from e.g. ps or Activity Monitor (under application name, e.g. PanelPro)<br>
<code>
ps | grep java | grep apps | awk '{print $1}'<br>
</code>
    <li>and then send a QUIT signal to that process.  E.g., if it's 6190, <br>
<code>
kill -s QUIT 6190<br>
</code>
    or you can combine them:<br>
<code>
kill -s QUIT `ps | grep java | grep apps | awk '{print $1}'`<br>
</code>
    <li>Then look for the output in Console or ....
    </ul>
<li>If you're running under Netbeans or Eclipse, there are simple menu commands to do this.
</ul>
Note that if running under Ant or an IDE, you might get more than one dump:  The one
you're looking for from JMRI, plus many one from Ant or the IDE itself.
