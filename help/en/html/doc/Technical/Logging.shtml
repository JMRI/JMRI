      <h1>JMRI Code: How to Use the Logging Facilities</h1>
      <p>This page provides a little information on how JMRI logs
      error, status and debugging information.</p>

      <p>For other details on JMRI internals, please see the
      <a href="../Technical/index.shtml" title=
      "technical pages">technical pages</a>.</p>

      <p>JMRI uses the Jakarta <a href=
      "https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html">Log4J</a>
      package to handle logging from individual classes.
      Specifically, as of Summer 2015, we use version 1.2.15; note
      that's not the most recent one! We use that via <a href=
      "http://www.slf4j.org">SLF4J</a> framework. (For libraries
      that use the java.util.logging framework, e.g. jmDNS, we also
      use the jul-to-slf4j adapter) <a name="levels" id=
      "levels"></a></p>

      <h3>Logging Levels</h3>This combination provides several
      levels of messages:

      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Level</th>

          <th>Code Fragment</th>

          <th>Use</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>ERROR</td>

          <td>log.error(..)</td>

          <td>Indicates the desired operation is not going to
          happen, and should explain why. ERROR is meant to be used
          only for serious problems which should get some attention
          every time they happen, typically indicating a possible
          fault in JMRI itself.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>WARN</td>

          <td>log.warn(..)</td>

          <td>The program is still operating, sort of, but
          something has gone wrong; often used to say "This
          operation may not have done all you wanted". Use WARN
          when the cause of the problem is incorrect user
          input.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>INFO</td>

          <td>log.info(..)</td>

          <td>Routine messages you want to see in normal operation.
          Keep these to a minimum please, there shouldn't be any
          after the program has started up.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>DEBUG</td>

          <td>log.debug(..)</td>

          <td>Detailed messages, only used in debugging. There is a
          lot of this, and turning it all on can slow the program
          down significantly.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>TRACE</td>

          <td>log.trace(..)</td>

          <td>Very detailed messages, even more than DEBUG, used
          for voluminous debugging (e.g. every character in a
          transmission) that would normally be off even when
          debugging. Typically only turned on for one class at a
          time due to volume and performance issues.</td>
        </tr>
      </table><a name="config" id="config"></a>

      <h3>Configuration</h3>By convention, JMRI applications will
      attempt to initialize Log4J using a "<a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/default.lcf">default.lcf</a>"
      logging control file. JMRI contains a version of the
      default.lcf file with extensive comments.
      (When running <a href="JUnit.shtml">JUnit tests</a>, a similar 
       "<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/tests.lcf">tests.lcf</a>"
       file is used.)
      Although JMRI  distributes the default.lcf file
      in the "Program Directory", 
      it's better if you put your own version in 
      the "Preferences Directory, which can be found by
      selecting the "Locations" item in the main help menu) The
      rest of this section describes the contents of a logging
      control file using the contents of default.lcf as an example.
      As

      <p>The line:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
 log4j.rootCategory= INFO, A1, T, R
</pre>
    controls where logging output goes. Later in the file, there
    are "appenders" A1, T and R defined that write log messages to:

      <ul>
        <li>A1 - the console on the local computer, really
        stdout/stderr, which is also available via the Console item
        on the JMRI Help menu</li>

        <li>R - a single file. By default, this is called
        "session.log". This starts anew each time JMRI is
        restarted.</li>

        <li>T - a set of rolling files. The current file is called
        "messages.log". When it reaches 2MB, it rolls to a new
        file. Two older versions are kept. Note that this continues
        through program restarts, so you can see any messages
        logged at the very beginning or end of the program.</li>
      </ul>The files are stored in directory specified by the
      jmri.log.path parameter, which is turn defaults to the log
      subdirectory in the preferences directory.

      <p>The "default.lcf" file also determines the format of the
      output by setting the "layout" parameter(s).</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
log4j.appender.R.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout<br>log4j.appender.R.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %-37.37c{2} %-5p - %m [%t]%n
</pre>

      <p>An example of the default format:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
2015-10-28 20:31:52,307 jmri.jmrit.powerpanel.PowerPane  WARN - No power manager instance found, panel not active [AWT-EventQueue-0]
</pre>
    The columns are:

      <ul>
        <li><code>2015-10-28 20:31:52,307</code> - local time the
        message was logged</li>

        <li><code>jmri.jmrit.powerpanel.PowerPane</code> - the
        place in the code (class name) that emitted the
        message</li>

        <li><code>WARN</code> - the severity of the message</li>

        <li><code>No power manager instance found, panel not
        active</code> - the message itself</li>

        <li><code>[AWT-EventQueue-0]</code> - name of the thread
        that emitted the message</li>
      </ul><a name="code" id="code"></a>

      <h3>Coding</h3>To log messages from a class named MyClass,
      add this to the bottom of the class's .java file:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);
</pre>

      <p>and add imports for org.slf4j.Logger and
      org.slf4j.LoggerFactory in your imports section:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        import org.slf4j.Logger;<br>
        import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
</pre>It's also OK to combine those into the fully-qualified form:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    private static final org.slf4j.Logger log = org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);
</pre>

      <p>(If logging is removed (e.g. commented out), it's OK to
      comment out the log definition so that it can be easily added
      back later on.)</p>

      <p>Then for each message to log insert a line like:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        log.debug("message");
</pre>

      <p>Messages that are not just an explicit string should use
      this form instead for variables:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        log.debug("Found {}", numberEntries);
</pre>
      <p>The string operations to build the actual error message (in
        this case, combining "Found" and the numberEntries argument) are
        only done if the message is going to be stored in the logs, which
        saves a lot of time during normal (non-debug) execution.</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong> It slows down logging to add <code>.toString()</code>
          to any fields or method results, so do not add that. SLF4J takes care
          of ensuring that <code>toString()</code> is called correctly.</p>

      <p>If it would be computationally expensive to pass a
      parameter into the log, use following form so the program
      does not waste time calculating parameters (in this case,
      calling numberEntries() to get a value to pass to the
      function call):</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
            log.debug("Found {}", numberEntries());
        }
</pre>
      <p>If you want to emit a warning only the first time
        it happens, there's a service method that will
        handle that for you:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        Log4JUtil.warnOnce(log, "The warning with arguments {} {}", "A", "B");
</pre>
        Note: The warnOnce method requires a bit of special handling in the unit and CI tests, see
        <a href="JUnit.shtml#warrnOnce">testing documentation</a>.
        
      <p>Exceptions should be logged as:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        log.error("my local text"+exception.getLocalizedMessage(), exception);

</pre>
    to include the user readable description from the exception
    itself, plus all its traceback information.
