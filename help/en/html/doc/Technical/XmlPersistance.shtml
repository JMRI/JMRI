      <h1>JMRI Code: XML Persistance</h1>

      <p>JMRI uses XML for persisting internal structures, especially when storing the preferences
      and panel files.</p>

      <p>XML persistance is done via some explicitly written code. Basically, certain classes
      register themselves with a instance of the "<a href=
      "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/ConfigureManager.html">ConfigureManager</a>". Normally,
      that will be the implementation that stores to and loads from XML files: <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/configurexml/ConfigXmlManager.html">jmri.configurexml.ConfigXmlManager</a>.
      When it's time to store, the ConfigureXmlManager is told to do it. It goes through the
      registered objects and finds the persisting class responsible for storing the object. E.g.
      class a.b.Foo will have the class a.b.configurexml.FooXml located. If that class is found,
      it's told to store the Foo object, and it adds Xml content to a JDOM document to do that. If
      it's not located, an error message is issued.</p>

      <p>On load, an XML file is read by the manager. Each element is examined for a "class"
      attribute. If found, that class is loaded and handed the element to process. Etc.</p>

      <p>Although the basic structure is cleanly separated, the code with the *Xml classes tends to
      have a lot of replication and special case. To keep that all sane, we do a lot of unit and CI
      testing on it.</p>

      <h3 id="ex">Example</h3>

      <p>A LightManager knows about Lights.<br>
      There are lots of concrete classes implementing the Light interface:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnLight</li>

        <li>jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.SerialLight</li>

        <li>jmri.jmrix.powerline.SerialLight</li>
      </ul>
      These have their own internal information, which is not always the same.
      <p>There are also multiple LightManager concrete classes to handle them:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnLightManager</li>

        <li>jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.SerialLightManager</li>

        <li>jmri.jmrix.powerline.SerialLightManager</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each type of manager is stored and loaded via a persistance class, who is found by looking
      the a class with "Xml" appended to the name, in a "configurexml" direct subpackage:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>jmri.jmrix.loconet.configurexml.LnLightManagerXml</li>

        <li>jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.configurexml.SerialLightManagerXml</li>

        <li>jmri.jmrix.powerline.configurexml.SerialLightManagerXml</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the case of Light concrete classes, the code for persisting the managers directly
      stores and loads the individual lights. This is because (so far) a given manager only has one
      type of Light (e.g. LnLightManager only has to worry about LnLight). In cases where this is
      not true, e.g. SignalHeads which have multiple classes, there are persistance classes for the
      individual objects in addition to the manager.</p>

      <h3 id="add">Adding More Information to a Class</h3>

      <p>If you want to store more state information, find the persisting class and add code to it
      to create and read attributes or elements.<br>
      Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to create a sample panel file with the objects you want
      to store in it:</p>

      <pre>
  &lt;sensors class="jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.configurexml.SerialSensorManagerXml" /&gt;
    &lt;sensor systemName="CS3001" /&gt;
  &lt;/sensor&gt;
  &lt;sensors class="jmri.managers.configurexml.InternalSensorManagerXml" /&gt;
   &lt;sensor systemName="IS21" /&gt;
  &lt;/sensors&gt;
  &lt;signalheads class="jmri.configurexml.AbstractSignalHeadManagerXml"&gt;
    &lt;signalhead class="jmri.configurexml.DoubleTurnoutSignalHeadXml" systemName="IH1P"&gt;
      &lt;turnout systemName="CT10" userName="1-bit pulsed green" /&gt;
      &lt;turnout systemName="CT2" userName="1-bit pulsed red" /&gt;
    &lt;/signalhead&gt;
  &lt;/signalheads&gt;
</pre>
      <p>Note the "class" attributes. They give the fully-qualified name of the class that can load
      or store that particular element. In the case of Sensors, we see there are two managers in
      use: One for C/MRI, and one for internal Sensors. For SignalHeads, there's only one manager,
      jmri.configurexml.AbstractSignalHeadManager persisted by
      jmri.configurexml.AbstractSignalHeadManager, but each particular SignalHead implementing
      class has it's own persisting class.</p>

      <p>To e.g. add more data to a sensor object, the
      jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.configurexml.SerialSensorManagerXml and
      jmri.managers.configurexml.InternalSensorManagerXml classes would have to be modified. This
      is where all the code to transfer to and from the stored form should go; don't add code in
      e.g. primary classes SerialSensorManager and InternalSensorManager to translate to or from
      the stored form. This keeps the main classes internal and flexible, allowing the persistance
      to be worked on (and tested and debugged!) separately.</p>

      <p>Boolean values should be stored as the strings "true" and "false".</p>

      <p>The <a href=
      "https://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/configurexml/AbstractXmlAdapter.html#getAttributeBooleanValue-org.jdom2.Element-java.lang.String-boolean-">
      <code>getAttributeBooleanValue</code></a>, <a href=
      "https://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/configurexml/AbstractXmlAdapter.html#getAttributeIntegerValue-org.jdom2.Element-java.lang.String-int-">
      <code>getAttributeIntValue</code></a>, and <a href=
      "https://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/configurexml/AbstractXmlAdapter.html#getAttributeDoubleValue-org.jdom2.Element-java.lang.String-double">
      <code>getAttributeIntegerValue</code></a> methods provide a simple way of parsing input and
      handling errors.</p>

      <p>Although much of the early code stored information in attributes, consider putting the
      data being stored in elements instead. This makes for simpler XML Schema and XSLT
      definitions, and the structured nature can be easier for humans to read.</p>

      <p>If you do add new attributes or elements, don't forget to update the format definition,
      see below.</p>

      <p>Note that in some cases, there's an inheritance relationship amoung the persisting classes
      that can help. For example, the LocoNet <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/configurexml/LnSensorManagerXml.html">LnSensorManagerXml</a>
      class inherits from <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/configurexml/AbstractTurnoutManagerConfigXML.html">jmri.configurexml.AbstractSensorManagerConfigXML</a>,
      which does almost all the work of storing and loading sensors.</p>

      <h3 id="errors">Handling Errors</h3>
      If theres a parsing error, exception, etc, it should be reported via the ErrorHandler. This
      accumulates reports and presents them (in a almost-useful way) to the user when appropriate.
      <p>For an example of how to do that, see the <code>getAttributeBooleanValue</code>
      method.</p>

      <h3 id="enum">Persisting enum values</h3>
      The "EnumIO" tool built into AbstractXmlAdapter that reads and writes enums via the names of
      their elements.
      <p>You add a member in your configureXml load/store class:</p>

      <pre>
    static final EnumIO&lt;MyEmum&gt; enumMap = new EnumIoNamesNumbers&lt;&gt;(MyEnum);
</pre><br>
      Then to store your value, in this example from the <code>myEnumValue</code> variable, you
      pass the enum value through that map element in your <code>store</code> method:

      <pre>
            element.setAttribute("name", "" + enumMap.outputFromEnum(myEnumValue));
</pre><br>
      Storing into an element is similar To restore the value on load:

      <pre>
        myEnumValue = enumMap.inputFromAttribute(element.getAttribute("name"));
</pre><br>
      There are several variations available, please see <a href=
      "https://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/configurexml/AbstractXmlAdapter.html">the Javadoc</a>.
      Briefly:
      <ul>
        <li>EnumIoNames - just stores and loads the enum element names.</li>

        <li>EnumIoNamesNumbers - stores and loads the enum element names. On load, if it encounters
        a small integer value n, i.e. from an older file format, that will be translated to the nth
        enum value.</li>

        <li>EnumIoOrdinals - just stores and loads via the enum's ordinal numbers. This provides
        complete load and store backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the file.</li>

        <li>EnumIoMapped - allows you to provide arbitrary mappings between enums and the values
        loaded and stored. It's possible to provide multiple load values that make to a single enum
        value, i.e. "3" and "Ralph".</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="refs">Persisting References to NamedBeans</h3>
      Classes should, but don't always, <a href="Patterns.shtml#handles">hold references to
      NamedBeans via NamedBean handles</a>.
      <p>If you're adding persistance for a class that doesn't do that, please update it before
      going further. That will save a lot of future trouble.</p>

      <p>To store a NamedBeanHandle reference, just store the result of the <code>getName()</code>
      method of the NamedBeanHandle. That's the name the user refers to it by.</p>

      <p>To load a reference, retrieve that name, look up the corresponding NamedBean (typically
      with <code>get(String)</code> method of the corresponding manager) and then create the
      NamedBeanHandle via the usual call:
      <code>InstanceManager.getDefault(jmri.NamedBeanHandleManager.class).getNamedBeanHandle(name,
      thing)</code></p>

      <h3>Class Migration</h3>
      Sometimes, classes need to be moved to another package as part of code maintenance. Since the
      fully-qualified class name, including package name, has been written to files, if we just
      move the class it will break reading of those files (in addition to breaking any user-written
      code that might refer to them). To handle this:
      <ul>
        <li>Move the *Xml file to its new location, just below the class it's loading and
        storing</li>

        <li>Make an entry in the <code>java/src/jmri/configurexml/ClassMigration.properties</code>
        file to map the old location to the new location</li>

        <li>Optionally, create an empty *Xml class in the old location that just inherits from the
        *Xml class in the new location (so that it will still work) and mark it deprecated. This
        keeps functional other people's code that e.g. might inherit from it. You can remove this
        after a decent interval.</li>
      </ul>
      There's also a service-oriented approach. For more on that, please see <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/configurexml/ClassMigration.html">jmri.configurexml.ClassMigration</a>
      that works in a similar way. For an example, see <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrix/pi/configurexml/RaspberryPiClassMigration.java">
      jmri.jmrix.pi.configurexml.RaspberryPiClassMigration</a>
      <h2 id="schema">Schema Management</h2>

      <p>JMRI controls XML semantics using <a href="XmlSchema.shtml">XML Schema</a>.</p>

      <p>For example, layout information is stored in XML files as a "layout-config" element, whose
      contents are then defined via a schema file. These files are kept in the <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/xml/schema">xml/schema</a> directory.</p>
