	    <H1>JMRI: XML Persistance</H1>


<P>
JMRI uses XML for persisting internal structures, especially when storing
the preferences and panel files.

<P>
XML persistance is done via some explicitly written code. Basically, certain classes 
register themselves with a instance of the "ConfigureManager".  The only implementation 
of one of those we have is the one for loading and storing XML files: jmri.configurexml. 
ConfigXmlManager   When it's time to store, the ConfigureXmlManager is told to do it.  
It goes through the registered objects and finds the persisting class responsible for 
storing the object.  E.g. class a.b.Foo will have the class a.b.configurexml.FooXml 
located.  If that class is found, it's told to store the Foo object, and it adds Xml 
content to a JDOM document to do that.  If it's not located, an error message is issued.
<P>
On load, an XML file is read by the manager.  Each element is examined for 
a "class" attribute.  If found, that class is loaded and handed the element to 
process.  Etc.
<P>
It's quite hackish, and not very cleanly factored. There's a fair amount of 
code duplication, but that might be because it comes from a C++ background and 
the developer keeps wishing 
for templates and mixin classes.  But it works!

<h3>Example</h3>

A LightManager knows about Lights.
<p>
There are lots of concrete classes implementing the Light interface:
<ul>
<li>jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnLight
<li>jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.SerialLight
<li>jmri.jmrix.powerline.SerialLight
</ul>
These have their own internal information, which is not always the
same.
<p>
There are also multiple LightManager concrete classes to handle them:
<ul>
<li>jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnLightManager
<li>jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.SerialLightManager
<li>jmri.jmrix.powerline.SerialLightManager
</ul>

<p>
Each type of manager is stored and loaded via a persistance class, 
who is found by looking the a class with "Xml" appended to the name, in a 
"configurexml" direct subpackage:
<ul>
<li>jmri.jmrix.loconet.configurexml.LnLightManagerXml
<li>jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.configurexml.SerialLightManagerXml
<li>jmri.jmrix.powerline.configurexml.SerialLightManagerXml
</ul>

<p>
In the case of Light concrete classes, the code for persisting the
managers directly stores and loads the individual lights.  This is
because (so far) a given manager only has one type of Light (e.g. 
LnLightManager only has to worry about LnLight).  In cases where this
is not true, e.g. SignalHeads which have multiple classes, there
are persistance classes for the individual objects in addition to the manager.

<h3>Added More Information To A Class</h3>

If you want to store more state information, find the persisting class
and add code to it to create and read attributes or elements.
<p>
Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to create a sample panel file
with the objects you want to store in it:

<p>
<pre>
  &lt;sensors class="jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.configurexml.SerialSensorManagerXml" /&gt;
    &lt;sensor systemName="CS3001" /&gt;
  &lt;/sensor&gt;
  &lt;sensors class="jmri.managers.configurexml.InternalSensorManagerXml" /&gt;
   &lt;sensor systemName="IS21" /&gt;
  &lt;/sensors&gt;
  &lt;signalheads class="jmri.configurexml.AbstractSignalHeadManagerXml"&gt;
    &lt;signalhead class="jmri.configurexml.DoubleTurnoutSignalHeadXml" systemName="IH1P"&gt;
      &lt;turnout systemName="CT10" userName="1-bit pulsed green" /&gt;
      &lt;turnout systemName="CT2" userName="1-bit pulsed red" /&gt;
    &lt;/signalhead&gt;
  &lt;/signalheads&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Note the "class" attributes. They give the fully-qualified name
of the class that can load or store that particular element. In the 
case of Sensors, we see there are two managers in use: One for C/MRI, and
one for internal Sensors.  For SignalHeads, there's only one manager,
jmri.configurexml.AbstractSignalHeadManager persisted by jmri.configurexml.AbstractSignalHeadManager, 
but each particular SignalHead implementing class has it's own persisting class.

<p>
To e.g. add more data to a sensor, the jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.configurexml.SerialSensorManagerXml
and jmri.managers.configurexml.InternalSensorManagerXml classes would have to be
modified.

<p>
Note that in some cases, there's an inheritance relationship amoung the
persisting classes that can help.  For example, the LocoNet 
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/configurexml/LnSensorManagerXml.html">LnSensorManagerXml</a>
class inherits from 
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/configurexml/AbstractTurnoutManagerConfigXML.html">jmri.configurexml.AbstractSensorManagerConfigXML</a>, which does
almost all the work of storing and loading sensors.

<p>
If you do add new attributes or elements, don't forget to update
the format definition, see below.

<a id="schema">
<h2>Schema Management</h2>

JMRI controls XML semantics using 
<a href="XmlSchema.shtml">XML Schema</a>.

<p>
For example, layout information is stored in XML files as
a "layout-config" element, whose contents are then defined via a
schema file.  These files are kept in the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/xml/schema">xml/schema</a>
directory.
