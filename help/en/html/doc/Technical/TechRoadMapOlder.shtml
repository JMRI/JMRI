<h4>JMRI 1.9, 2.0</h4>

The JMRI 1.9 development series moved forward to JRE 1.3, JDK 1.4.  This permitted use of:

<ul>
<LI>Collections in java.util instead of com.sun
<LI>Java2D, along with the associated printing support
<LI>Annotations (we need to develop conventions for their use)
<LI>JDOM 1.0 - Simplifies XML code, allows use of XSLT for dynamic combination
<LI>JUnit 3.8 - Minor improvements to test writing ease
<LI>Fewer jar files included in distribution
<LI>The Jakarta regexp regular expression library. (At some later
point, we'll have to move that forward to java.util.regexp, but that
won't be available until Java 1.4 in a later JMRI release)
</UL>

<P>
JMRI 1.9 and 2.0 will run on Windows 95 and later, all versions of Mac OS X, and 
all versions of Linux.
<P>
To build JMRI 1.9 and 2.0, you will need Windows 98 1st Ed or later, any version of
Mac OS X, or (almost any?) version of Linux.

<h4>JMRI 2.1, 2.2</h4>

The JMRI 2.1 development series moves forward to JRE 1.4, JDK 1.5.  
This permits use of
(subject to verification):

<ul>
<LI>SwingWorker (and associated updates of threading)
<LI>JUnit 4.0
<LI>Java3D
<LI>JavaHelp update
<LI>Drag and Drop
<LI>Annotations (we'll have to develop conventions for these)
<LI>JavaMail
<LI>Java regular expressions (java.util.regexp)
</UL>

<P>
JMRI 2.1 and 2.2 will run on Windows 98 1st Ed or later, 
any version of Mac OS X, 
or version of Linux.
<P>
To build JMRI 2.1 and 2.2, you will need Windows 98 2nd Ed or later,
Mac OS X 10.4 or later, 
or (almost any?) version of Linux.


<h4>JMRI 2.3, 2.4</h4>

The JMRI 2.3 development series moves forward to JRE 1.5, JDK 1.5.
This permits use of
(subject to verification):

<UL>
<LI>JSpinner (and removal of our replacement in jmri.util)
<LI>Enums (we'll need to make decisions about interface updates, e.g. Turnout.CLOSED)
<LI>printf, Formatter
<LI>generics (subject to decisions about conventions and interface updates)
</UL>

<P>
JMRI 2.3 and 2.4 will run on Windows 98 2nd Ed or later, 
Mac OS X 10.4 or later, 
or (almost any?) version of Linux.
<P>
To build JMRI 2.1 and 2.2, you will need Windows 98 2nd Ed or later,
Mac OS X 10.3 or later, 
or (almost any?) version of Linux.

<h4>JMRI 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8</h4>

These versions will continue to use Java 1.5 for both building and running.
<p>
During the 2.7 build series, we moved from the Crimson XML parser to Xerces.

<h4>JMRI 2.9, 2.10/3.0</h4>

Plans for the JMRI 2.9 development series are not
final. 
<p>
The JRE and JDK choice for JMRI 2.9 development 
will depend on desired runtime features, and availability on 
our popular user and development platforms. It is 
<u>tentatively</u>
Java 1.5 for both building and running, which is the same as JMRI 2.3.* and following ones.
<p>
During the 2.9.* series, we intend to move from the javax.comm serial classes to 
the RXTX gnu.io classes, either via RXTX 2.2-pre2 or some later version.
This will remove support for the MS100 from JMRI applications.


<h4>JMRI after Summer 2010</h4>

After JMRI 2.10/3.0 in early summer 2010, development will continue.
It's likely that soon after that, if not before, we'll have to 
move to using Java 1.6.
