      <h4>JMRI 1.9, 2.0</h4>The JMRI 1.9 development series moved
      forward to JRE 1.3, JDK 1.4. This permitted use of:

      <ul>
        <li>Collections in java.util instead of com.sun</li>

        <li>Java2D, along with the associated printing support</li>

        <li>Annotations (we need to develop conventions for their
        use)</li>

        <li>JDOM 1.0 - Simplifies XML code, allows use of XSLT for
        dynamic combination</li>

        <li>JUnit 3.8 - Minor improvements to test writing
        ease</li>

        <li>Fewer jar files included in distribution</li>

        <li>The Jakarta regexp regular expression library. (At some
        later point, we'll have to move that forward to
        java.util.regexp, but that won't be available until Java
        1.4 in a later JMRI release)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>JMRI 1.9 and 2.0 will run on Windows 95 and later, all
      versions of Mac OS X, and all versions of Linux.</p>

      <p>To build JMRI 1.9 and 2.0, you will need Windows 98 1st Ed
      or later, any version of Mac OS X, or (almost any?) version
      of Linux.</p>

      <h4>JMRI 2.1, 2.2</h4>The JMRI 2.1 development series moves
      forward to JRE 1.4, JDK 1.5. This permits use of (subject to
      verification):

      <ul>
        <li>SwingWorker (and associated updates of threading)</li>

        <li>JUnit 4.0</li>

        <li>Java3D</li>

        <li>JavaHelp update</li>

        <li>Drag and Drop</li>

        <li>Annotations (we'll have to develop conventions for
        these)</li>

        <li>JavaMail</li>

        <li>Java regular expressions (java.util.regexp)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>JMRI 2.1 and 2.2 will run on Windows 98 1st Ed or later,
      any version of Mac OS X, or version of Linux.</p>

      <p>To build JMRI 2.1 and 2.2, you will need Windows 98 2nd Ed
      or later, Mac OS X 10.4 or later, or (almost any?) version of
      Linux.</p>

      <h4>JMRI 2.3, 2.4</h4>The JMRI 2.3 development series moves
      forward to JRE 1.5, JDK 1.5. This permits use of (subject to
      verification):

      <ul>
        <li>JSpinner (and removal of our replacement in
        jmri.util)</li>

        <li>Enums (we'll need to make decisions about interface
        updates, e.g. Turnout.CLOSED)</li>

        <li>printf, Formatter</li>

        <li>generics (subject to decisions about conventions and
        interface updates)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>JMRI 2.3 and 2.4 will run on Windows 98 2nd Ed or later,
      Mac OS X 10.4 or later, or (almost any?) version of
      Linux.</p>

      <p>To build JMRI 2.1 and 2.2, you will need Windows 98 2nd Ed
      or later, Mac OS X 10.3 or later, or (almost any?) version of
      Linux.</p>

      <h4>JMRI 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8</h4>These versions will continue
      to use Java 1.5 for both building and running.

      <p>During the 2.7 build series, we moved from the Crimson XML
      parser to Xerces.</p>

      <h4>JMRI 2.9, 2.10/3.0</h4>Plans for the JMRI 2.9 development
      series are not final.

      <p>The JRE and JDK choice for JMRI 2.9 development will
      depend on desired runtime features, and availability on our
      popular user and development platforms. It is
      <u>tentatively</u> Java 1.5 for both building and running,
      which is the same as JMRI 2.3.* and following ones.</p>

      <p>During the 2.9.* series, we intend to move from the
      javax.comm serial classes to the RXTX gnu.io classes, either
      via RXTX 2.2-pre2 or some later version. This will remove
      support for the MS100 from JMRI applications.</p>

      <h4>JMRI after Summer 2010</h4>After JMRI 2.10/3.0 in early
      summer 2010, development will continue. It's likely that soon
      after that, if not before, we'll have to move to using Java
      1.6. 
      <!-- following added from TechRoadMap.shtml December 2015 -->

      <h4>JMRI 3.9, 3.10 (End of 2014)</h4>The JMRI 3.9 development
      series will stay with Java 1.6 for JRE and SDK.

      <h4>JMRI 3.11, 4.0 (Summer 2015)</h4>For multiple reasons
      including

      <ul>
        <li>Improved performance, particularly of web I/O and XML
        file loading, and</li>

        <li>Language and library improvements that made the
        developer's work easier,</li>
      </ul>the Spring 2015 series of test releases (JMRI 3.11.*)
      required Java 1.8 for both building and running. Java 1.8 is
      also required for the Summer 2015 production release and
      those that follow.

      <p>Planned JMRI changes that affect
      backwards-compatibility:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Planned removal of XmlIO web service.</li>

        <li>Removal of deprecated InstanceManager methods</li>

        <li>Removal of some deprecated pass-through classes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>New library features (subject to verification):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Update to JDOM 2 for efficiency and coding
        convenience</li>

        <li>Update Jython to at least 2.5.4 (bug fixes), and
        depending on compatibility testing, perhaps 2.7.* (for
        modern Python)</li>

        <li>Start using <a href=
        "https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305">JSR 305
        annotations</a> <a href=
           "http://spotbugs.github.io">via SpotBugs</a> to
        strengthen the code checking (see <a href=
