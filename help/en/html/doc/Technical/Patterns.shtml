      <h1>JMRI: Patterns and Organization</h1>

      <p>JMRI has grown and evolved with time, and you can't always
      see the currently-preferred structure and patterns by looking
      at older code pieces.</p>

      <p>This page attempts to describe the recommended structure
      and patterns, and point to examples of current best
      practices. <a id="namedbeans" name="namedbeans"></a></p>

      <a id="NamedBean" name="NamedBean"></a>
      <h2>Names, NamedBeans, and Managers</h2>
      The "NamedBean"
      concept is basic to JMRI. A <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBean.html">NamedBean</a>
      is a basic JMRI object that represents something, typically
      something like a specific Sensor or Turnout.

      <ul>
        <li>They're called a "Bean" because they're a unit of
        interaction: Multiple pieces of code can work with one, it
        can be loaded and stored, etc.</li>

        <li>They're "Named" to make sure they're unique and
        retrievable: There's only one Turnout NamedBean with called
        "LT01", and it represents a specific addressed (named)
        layout object. See the <a href="Names.shtml">page on
        Names</a> for more on this.</li>
      </ul>Functionally, all the device object classes (Sensor,
      Turnout, ...) and their specific implementations (LnSensor,
      XNetTurnout, ...) inherit from the base <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBean.html">NamedBean</a>
      class.

      <p>To get access to a specific object (a NamedBean of a
      specific type with a specific name), you make requests of a
      manager: You ask a <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/TurnoutManager.html">TurnoutManager</a>
      for a specific Turnout. In turn, you <a href=
      "IntroStructure.shtml">access the managers through the common
      InstanceManager</a>.</p>

      <p>A user might want to reference a NamedBean via a user
      name, and in turn might want to change the specific NamedBean
      that user name refers to. "Yard East Turnout" might be "LT12"
      at one point, and later get moved to "CT5". To handle this,
      your code should use <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBeanHandle.html">NamedBeanHandle</a>
      objects to handle references to NamedBeans. They automate the
      process of renaming.</p>
      <p>To do this, when you want to store a reference to 
      a NamedBean, e.g. to remember a particular Sensor, Turnout, SignalMast, etc
      ask (through the InstanceManager) the NamedBeanHandlerManager to give you a 
      NamedBeanHandle:
      <pre><code>
      NamedBeanHandle&lt;Sensor&gt; handle = InstanceManager.getDefault(NamedBeanHandleManager.class).getNamedBeanHandle(name, sensor);
      </code></pre> 
      where <code>name</code> is the String name that the user provided, either a 
      system name or user name, and <code>sensor</code> is the particular <code>Sensor</code> object
      being stored.   When you need to reference the sensor itself, just do
      <pre><code>
      sensor = handle.getBean();
      </code></pre>
      Please use <code>getBean()</code> every time you need to access the bean.  Don't cache the
      reference from <code>getBean()</code>.  That way, if somebody does a "move" or "rename" operation,
      the <code>NamedBeanHandle</code> will get updated and you're next <code>getBean()</code> call will get the
      right reference.

      <h2>Service Providers</h2>
      Java provides a capability, using a 
      "Service Provider Interface", 
      that allows us to reduce the complexity of our
      code by having the code itself discover what pieces
      are available and need to be installed. 
      For background on this, see the 
      tutorial
      sections on
      "<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html">Creating Extensible Applications</a>"
      and
      "<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html">Introduction to the Service Provider Interfaces</a>".
      
      <p>
      For example, by annotating a class with
      <pre><code>
      @ServiceProvider(service = PreferencesManager.class)
      </code></pre> 
      the 
      JMRI Preferences System
      automatically will discover that the class uses the preferences
      and should be hooked up.  This means that we don't have to 
      modify the Preferences classes to look up each new class using them, 
      and that we can (eventually) more incrementally build and distribute JMRI.
      
      <p>

      specifying the functionality):

      </dl>

      <p>
      Classes provide SPI also have to be registered with the system so they can be found.
      JMRI does this with entries
      inside files in the <code>target/classes/META-INF/services/</code> directory.
      These entries are created automatically during the JMRI build process from 
      the annotations in the source files.
      JMRI then packages those into the appropriate level of <code>jmri.jar</code> file, 
      where they will eventually be found and acted on.
