      <h1>JMRI: Patterns and Organization</h1>

      <p>JMRI has grown and evolved with time, and you can't always
      see the currently-preferred structure and patterns by looking
      at older code pieces.</p>

      <p>This page attempts to describe the recommended structure
      and patterns, and point to examples of current best
      practices. <a id="namedbeans" name="namedbeans"></a></p>

      <h2>Names, NamedBeans, and Managers</h2>The "NamedBean"
      concept is basic to JMRI. A <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBean.html">NamedBean</a>
      is a basic JMRI object that represents something, typically
      something like a specific Sensor or Turnout.

      <ul>
        <li>They're called a "Bean" because they're a unit of
        interaction: Multiple pieces of code can work with one, it
        can be loaded and stored, etc.</li>

        <li>They're "Named" to make sure they're unique and
        retrievable: There's only one Turnout NamedBean with called
        "LT01", and it represents a specific addressed (named)
        layout object. See the <a href="Names.shtml">page on
        Names</a> for more on this.</li>
      </ul>Functionally, all the device object classes (Sensor,
      Turnout, ...) and their specific implementations (LnSensor,
      XNetTurnout, ...) inherit from the base <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBean.html">NamedBean</a>
      class.

      <p>To get access to a specific object (a NamedBean of a
      specific type with a specific name), you make requests of a
      manager: You ask a <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/TurnoutManager.html">TurnoutManager</a>
      for a specific Turnout. In turn, you <a href=
      "IntroStructure.shtml">access the managers through the common
      InstanceManager</a>.</p>

      <p>A user might want to reference a NamedBean via a user
      name, and in turn might want to change the specific NamedBean
      that user name refers to. "Yard East Turnout" might be "LT12"
      at one point, and later get moved to "CT5". To handle this,
      your code should use <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBeanHandle.html">NamedBeanHandle</a>
      objects to handle references to NamedBeans. They automate the
      process of renaming.</p>
      <p>To do this, when you want to store a reference to 
      a NamedBean, e.g. to remember a particular Sensor, Turnout, SignalMast, etc
      ask (through the InstanceManager) the NamedBeanHandlerManager to give you a 
      NamedBeanHandle:
      <pre><code>
      NamedBeanHandle&lt;Sensor&gt; handle = InstanceManager.getDefault(NamedBeanHandleManager.class).getNamedBeanHandle(name, sensor);
      </code></pre> 
      where <code>name</code> is the String name that the user provided, either a 
      system name or user name, and <code>sensor</code> is the particular <code>Sensor</code> object
      being stored.   When you need to reference the sensor itself, just do
      <pre><code>
      sensor = handle.getBean();
      </code></pre>
      Please use <code>getBean()</code> every time you need to access the bean.  Don't cache the
      reference from <code>getBean()</code>.  That way, if somebody does a "move" or "rename" operation,
      the <code>NamedBeanHandle</code> will get updated and you're next <code>getBean()</code> call will get the
      right reference.
      
      <h2>Code Organization</h2>

      <p>At the highest level, we separate test code from
      distributed code by putting both in separate directories
      within the development directory: "test" and "src". This
      makes it easy to compile a version without test code, to
      apply different tools to the two types of code, etc.</p>

      <p>Within the source code itself, we separate out several
      types:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>The jmri package</dt>

        <dd>contains the basic interfaces and certain core
        implementations for the JMRI layout management concepts. It
        should contain minimal implementation code, and no non-JMRI
        references, esp. Swing code.</dd>

        <dt>The jmri.jmris package</dt>

        <dd>contains all the code for the server implementation for
        the JMRI interfaces.</dd>

        <dt>The jmri.jmrit package</dt>

        <dd>contains all the code for various non-system-specific
        JMRI tools and extensions. Most of the tools are in
        subpackages, but some appear directly in the package.</dd>

        <dt>The jmri.jmrix package</dt>

        <dd>contains all the code for connecting to specific layout
        hardware.</dd>

        <dt>The jmri.managers and jmri.implementations
        packages</dt>

        <dd>These provide default implementations for managers and
        other classes. This moves code out of the primary jmri
        package. These should not reply on apps, jmri.jmrix or
        jmri.jmrit.</dd>

        <dt>The jmri.util package</dt>

        <dd>Other common implementations of general use. Should not
        depend on jmri.jmrit or jmri.jmrix packages. The
        jmri.util.swing subpackage provides Swing utilities.</dd>

        <dt>Apps package</dt>

        <dd>For putting together an application, this can depend on
        anything.</dd>

        <dt>configurexml subdirectories</dt>

        <dd>These contain code for the <a href=
        "XmlPersistance.shtml">XML configuration system</a>.
        top-level packages, esp util &amp; dependencies, apps</dd>

        <dt>swing subdirectories</dt>

        <dd>Contain Swing specific tools. Particularly outside the
        jmri.jmrit package, we are trying to separate Swing code
        from normal operational code. See the <a href=
        "Swing.shtml">Swing page</a> for more information.</dd>

        <dt>Help files</dt>

        <dd>The file structure for Help files echos the structure
        of the code. For more information, see the <a href=
        "Help.shtml">Help page on JavaHelp pages</a>.</dd>

        <dt>ResourceBundles</dt>

        <dd>
          We use resource bundles for <a href=
          "I8N.shtml">internationalization</a>. The are colocated
          with the code that references them, but we are moving to
          a new naming convention. To reduce loading burden, we are
          moving to a pattern where the
          jmri.foo.FooBundle.properties file is addressed via a
          static element in the jmri.foo.FooBundle class, separate
          from the properties file itself. This reduces loading
          time a lot!

          <p>Note that there are also a few resource bundles that
          are used for other purposes, indicated in their header
          comments.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>The "checkdepends.csh" development tool script is meant
      to check some for inadvertant dependencies, but we're far
      from clearing it. <!--#include virtual="/Footer" -->
