<h1>JMRI: Patterns and Organization</h1>
<p>
JMRI has grown and evolved with time, and
you can't always see the currently-preferred
structure and patterns by looking at older code pieces.
<p>
This page attempts to describe the recommended structure and patterns,
and point to examples of current best practices.

<a id="namedbeans" name="namedbeans"></a><h2>Names, NamedBeans, and Managers</h2>

The "NamedBean" concept is basic to JMRI.
A <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBean.html">NamedBean</a>
is a basic JMRI object that represents something, typically something 
like a specific Sensor or Turnout.  
<ul>
<li>They're called a "Bean" because they're a unit of 
interaction:  Multiple pieces of code can work with one, it can be loaded and stored, etc.
<li>They're "Named" to make sure they're unique and retrievable:  There's only one Turnout NamedBean with 
called "LT01", and it represents a specific addressed (named) layout object.
See the <a href="Names.shtml">page on Names</a> for more on this.
</ul>
Functionally, all the device object classes (Sensor, Turnout, ...) and 
their specific implementations (LnSensor, XNetTurnout, ...) inherit from the 
base
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBean.html">NamedBean</a> class.
<p>
To get access to a specific object (a NamedBean of a specific type with a specific name), you
make requests of a manager:  You ask a 
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/TurnoutManager.html">TurnoutManager</a> for a specific Turnout.
In turn, you 
<a href="IntroStructure.shtml">access the managers through the common InstanceManager</a>.

<p>
A user might want to reference a NamedBean via a user name, and in turn might want 
to change the specific NamedBean that user name refers to.  "Yard East Turnout" might be
"LT12" at one point, and later get moved to "CT5".  To handle this, 
your code should use 
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBeanHandle.html">NamedBeanHandle</a>
objects to handle references to NamedBeans.  They automate the process of renaming.

<h2>Code Organization</h2>
<p>
At the highest level, we separate test code from 
distributed code by putting both in separate directories
within the development directory: "test" and "src".
This makes it easy to compile a version without test code,
to apply different tools to the two types of code, etc.

<p>
Within the source code itself, we separate out several types:

<dl>
<dt>The jmri package
<dd>contains the basic interfaces and certain core implementations for the JMRI layout management concepts.
    It should contain minimal implementation code, 
    and no non-JMRI references, esp. Swing code.

<dt>The jmri.jmris package
<dd>contains all the code for the server implementation for the JMRI interfaces.

<dt>The jmri.jmrit package
<dd>contains all the code for various non-system-specific JMRI tools and extensions.
Most of the tools are in subpackages, but some appear directly in the package.

<dt>The jmri.jmrix package
<dd>contains all the code for connecting to 
    specific layout hardware.

<dt>The jmri.managers and jmri.implementations packages
<dd>These provide default implementations for managers
    and other classes.  This moves code out of the primary
    jmri package.  These should not reply on apps, jmri.jmrix
    or jmri.jmrit.

<dt>The jmri.util package
<dd>Other common implementations of general use.
    Should not depend on jmri.jmrit or jmri.jmrix packages.
    The jmri.util.swing subpackage provides Swing 
    utilities.

<dt>Apps package
<dd>For putting together an application, this can
    depend on anything.
    
<dt>configurexml subdirectories
<dd>These contain code for the
    <a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">XML configuration system</a>. 
    top-level packages, esp util & dependencies, apps

<dt>swing subdirectories
<dd>Contain Swing specific tools.
    Particularly outside the jmri.jmrit package,
    we are trying to separate Swing code from 
    normal operational code.
    See the <a href="Swing.shtml">Swing page</a>
    for more information.

<dt>Help files
<dd>The file structure for Help
    files echos the structure of the code.
    For more information, see the 
    <a href="Help.shtml">Help page on JavaHelp pages</a>.

<dt>ResourceBundles
<dd>We use resource bundles for
    <a href="I8N.shtml">internationalization</a>.
    The are colocated with the code that references them,
    but we are moving to a new naming convention.
    To reduce loading burden, we are moving to a 
    pattern where the jmri.foo.FooBundle.properties
    file is addressed via a static element in the
    jmri.foo.FooBundle class, separate from the 
    properties file itself.  This reduces loading
    time a lot!
    <p>
    Note that there are also a few 
    resource bundles that are used for other purposes,
    indicated in their header comments.
    
</dl>

The "checkdepends.csh" development tool script 
is meant to check some for inadvertant dependencies,
but we're far from clearing it.
