<H1>JMRI: XML Usage</H1>

JMRI uses XML for a number of purposes: 
to hold decoder definitions, for its
<a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">persistance system</a>
for configuration and panel information,
and to create parts of the web site from other files.
This page describes some aspects of this.

<h2>File Format Definitions</h2>

Starting with JMRI 2.9.4
file formats are specified by XML Schema.
Those XML Schema are described on a 
<a href="XmlSchema.shtml">separate page</a>.

<p>
Prior to that, DTDs were used.

<P>
Those schema and DTDs need to be available to the program when it
reads the files, as they define the default values of missing
attributes and other needed information.

<P>
In the JMRI distributions, these are stored in the 
<a href="/xml/schema">xml/schema</a> 
and
<a href="/xml/DTD">xml/DTD</a> 
directories. 

<p>
JMRI writes all files to reference schema using 
URLs such as "http://jmri.org/xml/schema/layout.xsd".
When read by the program 
this will automatically be handled properly by a custom resolver.
When read by e.g. a web browser, the browser can get the schema from
the main JMRI web servers when needed.

<p>
The DTDs were located from DOCTYPE definition statements
in the XML files.  For historical reasons, these can 
be in several formats. The complicated set of rules for
mapping those to a directory location is described on a 
<a href="XmlDtdUsage.shtml">separate page</a>.

<h2>Other Information</h2>

JMRI XML files can generally be formatted and 
viewed in web browsers. We control the formatting
using XSLT transforms.  The process is described on a
<a href="XmlView.shtml">separate page</a>.

<p>
XML files can be edited with a text editor, but 
a dedicated editor can help a lot.  We have a 
<a href="XmlEditors.shtml">list of editors</a>, along with a few comments on each.
