      <h1>JMRI: XML Usage</h1>

      <p>JMRI uses XML for a number of purposes: to hold decoder
      definitions, for its <a href=
      "XmlPersistance.shtml">persistance system</a> for
      configuration and panel information, and to create parts of
      the web site from other files. This page describes some
      aspects of this.</p>

      <h2>File Format Definitions</h2>

      <p>Starting with JMRI 2.9.4 file formats are specified by XML
      Schema. Those XML Schema are described on a <a href=
      "XmlSchema.shtml">separate page</a>.</p>

      <p>Prior to that, DTDs were used. Reading those older files
      is still supported.</p>

      <p>Those schema and DTDs need to be available to the program
      when it reads the files, as they define the default values of
      missing attributes and other needed information.</p>

      <p>In the JMRI distributions, these are stored in the
      <a href="/xml/schema">xml/schema</a> and <a href=
      "/xml/DTD">xml/DTD</a> directories.</p>

      <p>JMRI writes all files to reference schema using URLs such
      as "http://jmri.org/xml/schema/layout-2-9-6.xsd". When read by the
      program this will automatically be handled properly by a
      custom resolver. When read by e.g. a web browser, the browser
      can get the schema from the main JMRI web servers when
      needed. For more information on how JMRI uses XML Schema,
      particularly how we control and version changes, 
      see our
      <a href="XmlSchema.shtml">page on XML Schema usage</a>
      and
      <a href="XmlSchemaExamples.shtml">associated set of examples</a>.</p>

      <p>The DTDs were located from DOCTYPE definition statements
      in the XML files. For historical reasons, these can be in
      several formats. The complicated set of rules for mapping
      those to a directory location is described on a <a href=
      "XmlDtdUsage.shtml">separate page</a>.</p>

      <h2>Other Information</h2>

      <p>JMRI XML files can generally be formatted and viewed in
      web browsers. We control the formatting using XSLT
      transforms. The process is described on a <a href=
      "XmlView.shtml">separate page</a>.</p>

      <p>XML files can be edited with a text editor, but a
      dedicated editor can help a lot. We provide a <a href=
      "XmlEditors.shtml">list of editors</a>, along with a few
      comments on each.</p>
