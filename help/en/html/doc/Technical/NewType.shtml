    <h1>JMRI Code: Adding A New Data Type</h1>

      <div class="para">
        <p>This page describes the steps to add a new data-type,
        e.g. Turnouts, to the JMRI code.</p>

        <p>It uses as an example the addition of the <em>Reporter</em> type
        in July, 2004. Reporter was added as a new type of NamedBean and
        is being used to bring complex information back from the layout.</p>
      </div>

        <p>Note that we don't do this very often, and 
        the specifics are more important than the generalities
        here.  You should should make sure you 
        understand the 
        <a href="SystemStructure.shtml">intended system connection structure</a>
        which is documented 
        <a href="SystemStructure.shtml">documented on another page</a>.
        
        <p>This mostly talks about a type that connected to one or more
        system connections, e.g. represents hardware-specific items.
        It's also possible to have non-layout-specific types, which are
        somewhat different (and should also be documented). For example,
        <code>Routes</code>.
        
    <!-- need to better document the proper package structure: jmri.managers vs jmri.implementations -->
    <!-- need to better document InstanceManager creation of default objects for non-specific types -->
    
        <p>We list the files that are modified and created in the
        order they were done in this case; other orders may also
        work, and you might not need to do all these.</p>

        <p>In this particular case, our first implementation is for
        only one hardware system (LocoNet). This effects how we
        ordered this, and reduced the need to have unit tests in
        place at the beginning. By working through the LocoNet
        implementation first, we could get a better idea of whether
        the proposed Reporter interface did what's needed. If you
        are creating a new type that several system will need at
        first, you should also create unit tests early in the
        process to encode what you think is the common
        behavior.</p>

        <p>In general, the new classes and interfaces defined below
        can most easily be made by copying an existing one. In this
        case, we copy the "*Turnout*" file to make a corresponding
        "*Reporter*" file.</p>


        <h3>Define the new type and it's manager</h3>

        <dl>

          <dt>Reporter</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This interface defines the properties needed. It
            should inherit from NamedBean, though you can add new
            accessors as desired.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>ReporterManager</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This interface provides methods for getting a
            Reporter object, either just from the system name
            (preferred) or with additional parameters</p>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>At this point, make sure you can compile.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>doc/Technical/Names.shtml</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Update the discussion of naming to include the
            type-letter for your new type. While you're at it,
            update the system-specific naming pages as needed.</p>
          </dd>

          </dl>
            <h3>Provide the base for implementations</h3>
          <dl>

          <dt>AbstractReporter</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This is a basic implementation.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>AbstractReporterManager</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Basic implementation; stuff that's useful to all the
            system-specific implementations</p>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>At this point, make sure you can compile.</p>

          <dt>managers.ProxyReporterManager</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This handles having more than one system providing
            Reporter objects. It takes zero or more ReporterManager
            implementations, and routes requests for Reporter
            access to the right one.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>InstanceManager</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>There are several historical ways to install things
            in the InstanceManager. The current way is to 
            use the <code>getDefault(..)</code>
            and <code>getOptionalDefault(..)</code> calls for
            a default and the <code>getList(..)</code>
            call to get access to all. </p>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>At this point, make sure you can compile.</p>

            implementation</h3>

          <dt>jmrix.loconet.LnReporterManager</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This class listens for activity indicating a new
            LocoNet-specific Reporter, and calls for one to be
            created if needed. Other than that, and providing the
            right system-specific letter (e.g. 'L'), this is just a
            direct copy.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>jmrix.loconet/LnReporter</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Converts specific messages into reporter actions and
            report. All of the rest of the stuff is just to get
            this in place.</p>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>At this point, make sure you can compile. Nothing
            will happen when you run until the next step.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>jmrix.loconet.LnPortController</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Here (or perhaps somewhere else in another system)
            you create an instance of the correct ReporterManager
            class at system startup and install it in the
            InstanceManager. See the 
            <a href="SystemStructure.shtml">system structure page</a> for more details.</p>

            (There may be other web pages too!)</p>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>At this point, you should be able to compile and

            action.</p>

            <p>In this particular case, the code had to be modified
            a little (instead of just copied) because a Reporter
            doesn't really have a way to support "click to
            change"</p>
