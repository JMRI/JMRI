	    <H1>JMRI: Adding A New System</H1>

		<div class=para>
		<p>This page describes the steps to add a new data-type,
		e.g. Powerline devices, to JMRI. </P>
		
		<p>It uses as an example the addition
		of the "powerline" type in January 2008. </p>
		</div>

		<div class=list>
		<p>We list the files that are modified and created in the 
		order they were done in this case; other orders may also work,
		and you might not need to do all these.</p>
		<P>
		In this particular case, we started by copying an 
		existing system implementation (SECSI).  This effects how
		we ordered this, and made the basic process move pretty 
		quickly.
		
		<dl>

		<h3>Duplicate an existing system</h3>

		    <dt>Create a duplicate file tree</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Using whatever tool that useful to you, 
			duplicate the src/jmri/jmrix subtree corresponding
			to the existing system you want to copy.</p>
		    </dd>

		    <dt>Change the package name information</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Using your favorite editor, change all the package
			names in the new files to their new location.  In this example,
			that was a bulk replace of "jmri.jmrix.secsi" with "jmri.jmrix.powerline".
		    </dd>

		    <P>At this point, make sure you can compile. This code
		    isn't consistent yet, but it should compile.</P>

		    <dt>Check copyright dates</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Because you've copied a system that might not
			have been touched for a while, go through and add
			the current year (and if need be, your name) to the 
			copyright notices in all the files.</p>
		    </dd>

		    <dt>Create SVN structure</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>In this step, we put the basic SVN structure in place.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Add all the directories you've created to SVN. In the example,
			this was:<br/>
			<code>svn add powerline powerline/serialdriver powerline/serialmon<br/>
			svn add powerline/configurexml powerline/serialdriver/configurexml</code>
			<li>Add all the COPYING files:<br/>
			<code>svn add powerline/COPYING powerline/*/COPYING powerline/*/*/COPYING</code>
            <li>Finally, commmit those files (but only those files):<br/>
			<code>svn commit -m"usual file" powerline</code>            
			</ul>
		    </dd>

		    <P>At this point, make sure you can compile.</P>

		<h3>Do Basic Migration</h3>

            <dt>Migrate names</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Using your favorite editor, change all 
            occurances of the old system name into the new one.</p>
            <code>bbedit `grep -irl secsi powerline/`</code>
            <p>Then search for and replace, perhaps not literally, all the
            occurances.</p>
            </dd>
            
		    <P>At this point, make sure you can compile.</P>

		<h3>Create Basic Tests</h3>

            <dt>Duplicate directory</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Following the steps above, duplicate 
            the directory for the previous systems tests, creating
            a new directory in test/jmri/jmrix to contain the 
            tests.  
            Change the package names, 
            check the copyright dates, 
            create the SVN structure,
            and migrate the names.</p>
            </dd>
            
		    <P>At this point, make sure you can compile
		    both the main code (which wasn't changed in this step)
		    and the tests.</P>
		    
		    <p>You should also be able to successfully run the 
		    tests in your new system (although they were created
		    for the old system's functionality):
		    <code>ant tests &amp;&amp;./runtest.csh jmri.jmrix.powerline.SerialTest</code>
            </dd>


		<h3>Connect Basics to Rest of System</h3>

            <dt>Connect to configuration menus</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Edit the jmri/jmrix/ActiveSystemsMenu.java file (two places),
            src/jmri/jmrix/JmrixConfigPane.java (one place) and 
            src/jmri/jmrix/SystemsMenu.java (one place) files to add the new 
            system.</p>
            <p>Don't commit this to SVN yet!</p>
            </dd>

		    <P>At this point, make sure you can compile and run DecoderPro, and
		    that your new system appears in the preferences panel.</P>
            
            <dt>Connect to test tree</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Edit the test/jmri/jmrix/JmrixTest.java file 
            to invoke your new system tests.</p>
            <p>Don't commit this to SVN yet!</p>
            </dd>

		    <P>At this point, when you "ant alltest", your new system's test
		    should be run.</P>
            

		<h3>Migrate to Basic Functionality</h3>

            <dt>Update connection options</dt>
            <dd>
            Speeds, etc, in powerline/serialdriver/SerialDriverAdapter.java.
            </dd>

            <dt>Get send/receive communications working</dt>
            <dd>
            The first step is to get communications working so that
            you can send a message from the "Send Command" window, 
            and see it and the response in the "Monitor" window.
            </dd>

		<h3>Make It Easy to Use</h3>

		    <dt>Add Possible Startup Items</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Edit src/apps/ActionListBundle.properties to add appropriate items.</p>
		    </dd>

		<h3>Complete the documentation</h3>

		    <dt>Create The Help Tree</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Start by duplicating, then edit, don't forget to
			update the index.</p>
			<p>You'll also have to change the locations on 
			the various frames</p>
		    </dd>

		    <dt>ant javadoc</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Create the JavaDocs, and fix any new (or old) problems.</p>
		    </dd>

		    <dt>Add the system to the "hardware" web pages</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Edit help/en/html/hardware/index.shtml</p>
		    </dd>

<h2>Adding a TCP/IP connection to an existing system</h2>

These are rough notes from adding a TCP/IP connection to the RFID type,
by copying the architecture of the C/MRI system.

<ol>
<li>Create a "networkdriver" directory in parallel to the "serialdriver" directory.
<br>
<code>svn cp java/src/jmri/jmrix/cmri/serial/networkdriver/ java/src/jmri/jmrix/rfid/</code>

<li>Edit the package and import statements, all files. ".cmri.serial." to ".rfid.", 
then ".cmri." to ".rfid.".

<li>Change the "setManufacturer" call in NetworkDriverAdapter.

<li>C/MRI might not have been the best starting point, but it's what we've got.
Some specific edits needed:
<ul>
    <li>Change CMRISystemConnectionMemo to RfidSystemConnectionMemo
    <li>Remove the reference to NodeConfigAction in ConnectionConfig (or
        use this as the base for any special configuration you need; it was
        adding a "Configure Nodes" button)
    <li>Change the name of SerialSensorManager throughout
    <li>Remove the SerialTurnoutManager SerialLightManager references (there aren't any in RFID)
    <li>Add RfidReporterManager   
</ul>

<li>Needs a network driver:<br>
<code>svn cp java/src/jmri/jmrix/cmri/serial/SerialNetworkPortController.java java/src/jmri/jmrix/rfid/RfidNetworkPortController.java</code><br>
and edit as above.

<li>java/src/jmri/jmrix/rfid/networkdriver/configurexml/ConnectionConfigXml.java 
contains dead code for configuring the C/MRI nodes (again, maybe not the
right system to copy from).  Leave that for later by 
commenting out the body of extendElement(Element e) and unpackElement(Element e).

<li>Change references to SerialTrafficController to RfidTrafficController.

<li>Another problem with C/MRI as a prototype is that it still has an 
instance() call in NetworkDriverAdapter.  Go to the RFID (multi-system capable)
SerialDriverAdapter and copy the structure there.
<code><pre>
        // connect to the traffic controller
        this.getSystemConnectionMemo().setRfidTrafficController(control);
        control.setAdapterMemo(this.getSystemConnectionMemo());
        control.connectPort(this);
        control.sendInitString();

        // declare up
        jmri.jmrix.rfid.ActiveFlag.setActive();
</code></pre>
(There's also a bunch of stuff before this in the configure() method that should
just be copied over, because the RFID connections also need some complicated configuration);
the ctor also needs some parts copied over.

<li>Add jmri.jmrix.rfid.networkdriver.ConnectionConfig to  java/src/jmri/jmrix/rfid//RfidConnectionTypeList.java

<li>Change "RFID Device Connection" to "Direct Serial Connection" in ConnectionConfig.name()
The network connection will default to "Network Connection".

<li>Check that configure/save/restart brings back all the configuration options.
It should, you copied the necessary code above, but check.

</ol>		

<h2>Connections with Complicated Setup</h2>

Some connection types need more configuration and/or setup than you can 
get with the usual option1/option2/option3 mechanism. Tools available are:

<ul>
<li>loadDetails() in ConnectionConfig.  This is invoked when
setting up the preferences window, and can be used to add
additional controls.  C/MRI uses this to add a "Configure Nodes" button.
RFID uses it to add listeners that control which combinations of options are available.

<li>extendElement(Element e) and unpackElement(Element e) in ConnectionConfigXml
can be used to store additional information and reload it, respectively.
C/MRI uses this to store its node information.

</ul>
