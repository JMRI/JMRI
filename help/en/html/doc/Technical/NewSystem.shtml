      <h1>JMRI Code: Adding A New System</h1>

        <p>This page describes the steps to add a new data-type,
        e.g. Powerline devices, to JMRI.</p>

        <p>It uses as an example the addition of the "powerline"
        type in January 2008.
        This was before
        several important migrations (SVN to Git;
        changes to the internal support for multiple connections;
        changes to how the Preferences mechanism works; etc)
        so this may need significant updating.</p>

        <p>Some parts may also be useful if you're adding
        a new connection (e.g. through a network link) to an
        existing system. If you do that, please mark those
        sections here for the next person to come along.</p>

        <p>Note that we don't do this very often, and
        the specifics are more important than the generalities
        here.  You should should make sure you
        understand the
        <a href="SystemStructure.shtml">intended system connection structure</a>
        which is documented on
        <a href="SystemStructure.shtml">another page</a>.

        <p>We list the files that are modified and created in the
        order they were done in this case; other orders may also
        work, and you might not need to do all these.</p>

        <p>In this particular case, we started by copying an
        existing system implementation (SECSI). This effects how we
        ordered this, and made the basic process move pretty
        quickly.</p>

            <h3>Duplicate an existing system</h3>
        <dl>

          <dt>Create a duplicate file tree</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Using whatever tool that useful to you, duplicate
            the src/jmri/jmrix subtree corresponding to the
            existing system you want to copy.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Change the package name information</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Using your favorite editor, change all the package
            names in the new files to their new location. In this
            example, that was a bulk replace of "jmri.jmrix.secsi"
            with "jmri.jmrix.powerline".</p>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>At this point, make sure you can compile. This code
            isn't consistent yet, but it should compile.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Check copyright dates</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Because you've copied a system that might not have
            been touched for a while, go through and add the
            current year (and if need be, your name) to the
            copyright notices in all the files.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Create Git structure</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>In this step, we put the basic Git structure in
            place.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Add all the directories you've created to Git. In
              the example, this was:<br>
              <code>git add powerline powerline/serialdriver
              powerline/serialmon<br>
              git add powerline/configurexml
              powerline/serialdriver/configurexml</code></li>

              <li>Add all the COPYING files:<br>
              <code>git add powerline/COPYING powerline/*/COPYING
              powerline/*/*/COPYING</code></li>

              <li>Finally, commmit those files (but only those
              files):<br>
              <code>git commit -m"usual file" powerline</code></li>
            </ul>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>At this point, make sure you can compile.</p>

          </dd>

<!-- (The dl vs h3 structure is really messed up here and below) -->
            </dl>
            <h3>Do Basic Migration</h3>
            <dl>
            
          <dt>Migrate names</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Using your favorite editor, change all occurances of
            the old system name into the new one.</p><code>bbedit
            `grep -irl secsi powerline/`</code>

            <p>Then search for and replace, perhaps not literally,
            all the occurances.</p>

            <p>At this point, make sure you can compile.</p>

          <dt>Register system for preferences</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Add the line
            <code>@ServiceProvider(service = ConnectionTypeList)</code> just
            before the class definition so that the preferences system sees your
            new connection types. You may also need to add the following import
            statements:<br>
            <code>import org.openide.util.lookup.ServiceProvider;</code><br>
            <code>import jmri.jmrix.ConnectionTypeList;</code>
          </dd>

          <dt>Update the documentation</dt>
          <dd><ul>
            <li>Most important, make an entry in the
                <a href="Names.shtml">Names.shtml</a>
                page for the system letter.
            <li>Add at least one page of documentation
                to the help/en/html/hardware area.
            <li>Link that from the
                <a href="../../hardware/index.shtml">help/en/html/hardware/index.shtml</a>
                hardware home page. Include a link to the
                manufacturer's web site if possible.
            </ul>
          </dd>

            <dt>Create Basic JUnit Tests</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>For more information on this, see the
            <a href="JUnit.shtml">testing page</a>.
            </dd>

          <dt>Duplicate directory</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Following the steps above, duplicate the directory
            for the previous systems tests, creating a new
            directory in test/jmri/jmrix to contain the tests.
            Change the package names, check the copyright dates,
            create the Git structure, and migrate the names.</p>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>At this point, make sure you can compile both the
            main code (which wasn't changed in this step) and the
            tests.</p>

            <p>You should also be able to successfully run the
            tests in your new system (although they were created
            for the old system's functionality): <code>ant tests
            &amp;&amp;./runtest.csh
            jmri.jmrix.powerline.SerialTest</code></p>
          </dd>

          </dl>
            <h3>Connect Basics to Rest of System</h3>
          <dl>

          <dt>Connect to configuration menus</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Edit the jmri/jmrix/ActiveSystemsMenu.java file (two
            places), src/jmri/jmrix/JmrixConfigPane.java (one
            place) and src/jmri/jmrix/SystemsMenu.java (one place)
            files to add the new system.</p>

            <p>Don't commit this to Git yet!</p>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>At this point, make sure you can compile and run
            DecoderPro, and that your new system appears in the
            preferences panel.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Connect to test tree</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Edit the test/jmri/jmrix/JmrixTest.java file to
            invoke your new system tests.</p>

            <p>Don't commit this to Git yet!</p>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>At this point, when you "ant alltest", your new
            system's test should be run.</p>
          </dd>
          
            </dl>

        <h2>Adding a TCP/IP connection to an existing
        system</h2>These are rough notes from adding a TCP/IP
        connection to the RFID type, by copying the architecture of
        the C/MRI system.

        <ol>
          <li>Create a "networkdriver" directory in parallel to the
          "serialdriver" directory.<br>
          <code>cp
          java/src/jmri/jmrix/cmri/serial/networkdriver/
          java/src/jmri/jmrix/rfid/</code></li>

          <li>Edit the package and import statements, all files.
          ".cmri.serial." to ".rfid.", then ".cmri." to
          ".rfid.".</li>

          <li>Change the "setManufacturer" call in
          NetworkDriverAdapter.</li>

          <li>C/MRI might not have been the best starting point,
          but it's what we've got. Some specific edits needed:

            <ul>
              <li>Change CMRISystemConnectionMemo to
              RfidSystemConnectionMemo</li>

              <li>Remove the reference to NodeConfigAction in
              ConnectionConfig (or use this as the base for any
              special configuration you need; it was adding a
              "Configure Nodes" button)</li>

              <li>Change the name of SerialSensorManager
              throughout</li>

              <li>Remove the SerialTurnoutManager
              SerialLightManager references (there aren't any in
              RFID)</li>

              <li>Add RfidReporterManager</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Needs a network driver:<br>
          <code>cp
          java/src/jmri/jmrix/cmri/serial/SerialNetworkPortController.java
          java/src/jmri/jmrix/rfid/RfidNetworkPortController.java</code><br>

          and edit as above.</li>

          <li>
          java/src/jmri/jmrix/rfid/networkdriver/configurexml/ConnectionConfigXml.java
          contains dead code for configuring the C/MRI nodes
          (again, maybe not the right system to copy from). Leave
          that for later by commenting out the body of
          extendElement(Element e) and unpackElement(Element
          e).</li>

          <li>Change references to SerialTrafficController to
          RfidTrafficController.</li>

          <li>Another problem with C/MRI as a prototype is that it
          still has an instance() call in NetworkDriverAdapter. Go
          to the RFID (multi-system capable) SerialDriverAdapter
          and copy the structure there.
            <pre>
<code>
        // connect to the traffic controller
        this.getSystemConnectionMemo().setRfidTrafficController(control);
        control.setAdapterMemo(this.getSystemConnectionMemo());
        control.connectPort(this);
        control.sendInitString();

        // declare up
        jmri.jmrix.rfid.ActiveFlag.setActive();
</code>
</pre>(There's also a bunch of stuff before this in the configure()
method that should just be copied over, because the RFID
connections also need some complicated configuration); the ctor
also needs some parts copied over.
          </li>

          <li>Add jmri.jmrix.rfid.networkdriver.ConnectionConfig to
          java/src/jmri/jmrix/rfid//RfidConnectionTypeList.java</li>

          <li>Change "RFID Device Connection" to "Direct Serial
          Connection" in ConnectionConfig.name() The network
          connection will default to "Network Connection".</li>

          <li>Check that configure/save/restart brings back all the
          configuration options. It should, you copied the
          necessary code above, but check.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Connections with Complicated Setup</h2>Some connection
        types need more configuration and/or setup than you can get
        with the usual option1/option2/option3 mechanism. Tools
        available are:

        <ul>
          <li>loadDetails() in ConnectionConfig. This is invoked
          when setting up the preferences window, and can be used
          to add additional controls. C/MRI uses this to add a
          "Configure Nodes" button. RFID uses it to add listeners
          that control which combinations of options are
          available.</li>

          <li>extendElement(Element e) and unpackElement(Element e)
          in ConnectionConfigXml can be used to store additional
          information and reload it, respectively. C/MRI uses this
          to store its node information.</li>
        </ul>
