  <h1>JMRI: Developing with JMRI Code</h1>

  <h2>Background</h2>

Anybody is welcome to get a copy of the JMRI code and modify it for their
own purposes.  What makes one a JMRI developer is contributing those
modifications back for others to use.  This page discusses how to do
that, assuming that you've gotten a copy of the code 
following the 
<a href="getgitcode.shtml">previously described procedures</a>.  

<p>See also the <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">JMRI Git FAQ page</a>.</p>

<p>The basic process is to make your changes, compile/run/test until
you've finished your intended change, and then to send that 
change back for inclusion into the main repository.
<p>
That's done with a three-step process:
<ol>
<li>You periodically &quot;commit&quot; your changes to your local
    repository.
<li>You periodically &quot;push&quot; those changes to a
repository of your own on GitHub.
<li>When your change is complete, you create a 
&quot;pull request&quot;
that allows JMRI to get your change from your GitHub repository
and merge it into JMRI's main repository.
</ol>
  
<h3>Commit Changes to Your Local Repository</h3>
You should commit your changes into your local repository often.

<p>
With SVN, there was one central repository that everybody shared. 
Git provides everybody with their own local repository, and then
links them together with "pull", "push" and "pull request" operations.
When you commit, you're saving a copy of your changes into your local
repository where they're safe, and can eventually be moved onward.

  <pre><code>
  git commit -m&quot;useful comment&quot;
  </code></pre>

<a name="repo" id="repo"></a><h3>Get Your Own GitHub Repository</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>Get a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a> and login
  <li>Tell GitHub to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">"fork" JMRI's repository</a> 
  into one of your own. There's a 
  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">good help page</a>,
  but basically you go to the 
  <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">JMRI repository page</a>
  and click the "fork" button in the upper right.
   
  </ul>
  <p>
  This gives you your own repository, which you can then work with freely.
  
  <p>
  If you're using the command line,
  the next step is to connect it to your local repository.
  (IDE users will do this next part in their IDE, see
  those instructions)
  On the web page for your repository, right side, is a "HTTPS Clone URL".
  Copy that. In your repository directory on your local computer, do
  
  <pre><code>
  git remote set-url --push origin https://github.com/yourname/JMRI.git
  </code></pre>
  (With the appropriate URL)
  <p>
  After this, doing a &quot;git push&quot; will push your changes up to
  your repository. &quot;git pull&quot; will still pull from the main 
  repository so that you can get the most recent updates from others.  To
  check this, do a &quot;git remote -v&quot; which should show:
  
<code><pre>
   % git remote -v<br/>
   origin	https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git (fetch)<br/>
   origin	https://github.com/yourname/JMRI.git (push)
</pre></code>
  

 <a name="push" id="push"></a><h3>Push Your Changes to Your GitHub Repository</h3>
 
 Now that you have a consistent set of changes committed locally, 
 you can move them up to your repository on GitHub. That makes 
 them visible to everybody else.
 
  <pre><code>
  git push
  </code></pre>


 <a name="pull" id="pull"></a><h3>Submit a Pull Request</h3>

The last step is to make your changes, visible in your GitHub repository,
known to the JMRI maintainers so that one of them can pull it into the main 
JMRI repository.  To do that, you create and submit a "pull request" that
automatically has all the needed info.

<ul>
<li>Login to GitHub and go to the page for your JMRI clone repository (yours, not 
    the main JMRI one)
<li>There's a "Pull Request" button at the upper right of the file listing.
    Click it.
<li>On the next page, click the "Create pull request" button.
<li>Fill out the forms.  A short title that describes the feature you've written
    helps other people find it.  A few lines in the comment about what it does, how 
    you added it, etc is also very helpful.
<li>Click "Create pull request".  That submits all the info and notifies
    the JMRI maintainers.  One of them will check it over and either contact you for
    more info (occasionally), or merge it into the main repository (more often).
    You can sign up for a notification when that happens.
</ul>
