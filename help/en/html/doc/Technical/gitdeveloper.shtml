      <h1>JMRI Code: Developing with JMRI</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      Anybody is welcome to get a copy of the JMRI code and modify
      it for their own purposes. What makes one a JMRI developer is
      contributing those modifications back for others to use.<br>
      This page discusses how to do that, assuming that you have
      access to a copy of the code following
      <a href="getgitcode.shtml">this procedure</a>.

      <p>See the <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">JMRI Git FAQ page</a> for
      more details on these processes.</p>

      <p>The links to the left provide more information on building
      with specific tools. You should read the page for your
      particular setup.</p>

      <p>The rest of this page provides an overview of the process
      of developing JMRI code with Git. Basically, you create a new
      branch, make your changes, compile/run/test until you've
      finished your intended change, and then send that change back
      for inclusion into the main repository.</p>

      <p>That's done with a four-step process:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>You create a Git branch to hold your work.</li>

        <li>You periodically "commit" your changes to your local
        repository.</li>

        <li>You periodically "push" those changes to a repository
        of your own on GitHub.</li>

        <li>When your change is complete, you create a "pull
        request" that allows JMRI to get your change from your
        GitHub repository and merge it into JMRI's main
        repository.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Create a Branch for Development</h3>Git is very good at
      keeping development on parallel "branches" separate. Although
      the primary development is on the "master" branch, we
      strongly recommend that you don't directly make changes to
      that. There are a lot of JMRI developers, and having them all
      work on a single branch can get confusing. Instead, you
      should create a separate branch for each of your projects,
      work on it until it's ready to be merged back into the main
      JMRI source, and then contribute the entire branch contents
      back to our main repository.

      <p>To create a new branch:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  git checkout master<br>  
  git pull<br>  
  git checkout -b my-new-feature-or-fix<br>  
</pre>

      <p>The first two "git checkout master" &amp; "git pull" lines
      makes sure that you are starting from the most recent
      "master" branch contents. The master branch is where we do
      development between test releases.</p>

      <p>The -b option in the last line creates a new branch which
      will contain your new work. This lets you work on it without
      interference from other people's changes until you're ready
      to merge with those. The "checkout" means that you're now
      working on that new branch, which will hold whatever you
      commit in later steps.</p>

<h3>Develop and Test Locally</h3>
    Now that you have a copy of the code available, you can directly
    work in it to develop any changes you want to make.
    There are several different ways to do that, see the sidebar,
    including 
        <a href="Ant.shtml">using Ant from the command line</a>,
        <a href="NetBeans.shtml">using the NetBeans IDE</a>,  
        <a href="Eclipse.shtml">using the Eclipse IDE</a>, and 
        <a href="IntelliJ.shtml">using the IntelliJ IDE</a>.
    You use one of those to compile your code and organize it
    so that it can be run, and then to run both the individual
    programs (PanelPro, DecoderPro et al) and various 
    <a href="JUnit.shtml">tests that it's all still working</a>.
    
    <p>
    There's not much to worry about here.  If you make a bad change, you 
    can get back the original (last changed in your checked-out branch)
    version with e.g. 

<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  git checkout -- xml/decoderIndex.xml
</pre>
    (Note the two dashes, and change the file path to the one you want changed back)
    Any changes you do make aren't recorded until you commit them, see below.
    <p>
    There are two things you should be careful of:
    <ul>
    <li>You have to tell git about new files that you create:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
                    git add java/src/jmri/util/MyNewFile.java
</pre>
    If you don't do that, by default git ignores a new file. This 
    can be very confusing with a new file doesn't end up in the git 
    repository.  Also, create new files as "readable by anybody";
    if you create them in a protected or locked mode, git can have 
    trouble processing them.
    <li>Never, really never, copy files out of or into a 
    git-managed directory.  Just don't do it.  It might seem
    reasonable to "set a copy of the old files aside", and 
    then pull them back in later (instead of using 
    i.e. <code>git checkout --</code> to get back older versions)
    but this can lead to you (accidentally) deleting other people's
    work.  This is Very Not Good.  Don't copy files in and out of
    your repository space.  If you're trying to do something special,
    and you think that copying in and out is the only way to do it, 
    ask for help:  There are ways of doing everything you want done
    without risking the loss of other people's work.
    </ul>
    
    <a name="note" id="note"></a>
    <p>As you work, we encourage you to add a brief 
    description of your changes to the 
    draft release note, which 
    can be found in the 
    <a href="../../../releasenotes">help/en/releasenotes</a>
    directory
    as the 
    <a href="../../../releasenotes/current-draft-note.shtml">help/en/releasenotes/current-draft-note.shtml</a> 
    file. When your changes are eventually merged into the main 
    repository and included in a release, this will be how other JMRI users find out 
    about them.  You can also cut&amp;paste what you write here into 
    your pull request (see below) to help explain your change to the people reviewing it.
    If your work requires that the users be warned about something, i.e. to do a
    migration, please also add that to the 
    <a href="../../../releasenotes/current-draft-warnings.shtml">help/en/releasenotes/current-draft-warnings.shtml</a> 
    file which works similarly.
    
<h3>Commit Changes to Your Local Repository</h3>
      You should
      commit your changes into your local repository often.

      <p>With the older SVN system, 
      there was one central repository that everybody
      shared. Git provides everybody with their own local
      repository, and then links them together with "pull", "push"
      and "pull request" operations. When you commit, you're saving
      a copy of your changes into your local repository where
      they're safe, and can eventually be moved onward.</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  git commit
</pre>
    When you do this, Git will open an editor window for your
    commit note. The top line becomes the summary, which should be
    clear by itself as this will appear in lists of changes. You should
    keep that summary to 50 characters or less, so it can be displayed
    compactly. Please add more detail in additional lines after the
    summary, because that helps your friends and colleagues understand
    what you've done. <a name="repo" id="repo"></a>

      <h3>Get Your Own GitHub Repository</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Get a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub
        account</a> and login</li>

        <li>Tell GitHub to <a href=
        "https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">"fork"
        JMRI's repository</a> into one of your own. There's a
        <a href=
        "https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">good help
        page</a>, but basically you go to the <a href=
        "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">JMRI repository page</a> and
        click the "fork" button in the upper right.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This gives you your own repository, which you can then
      work with freely.</p>

      <p>If you're using the command line, the next step is to
      connect it to your local repository. (IDE users will do this
      next part in their IDE, see those instructions) On the web
      page for your repository, right side, is a "HTTPS Clone URL".
      Copy that. In your repository directory on your local
      computer, do</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  git remote set-url --push origin https://github.com/yourname/JMRI.git
  git remote add yourname https://github.com/yourname/JMRI.git
</pre>
    (With the appropriate URL, changing "yourname" to your GitHub account name in three places)

      <p>After this, doing a "git push" will push your changes up
      to your repository. "git pull" will still pull from the main
      repository so that you can get the most recent updates from
      others. To check this, do a "git remote -v" which should
      show: (OK if it shows others or the order is different)</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   % git remote -v<br>
   origin       https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git (fetch)<br>
   origin       https://github.com/yourname/JMRI.git (push)
   yourname     https://github.com/yourname/JMRI.git
</pre>
    <a name="push" id="push"></a>

      <h3>Push Your Changes to Your GitHub Repository</h3>
      
      Now that
      you have a consistent set of changes committed locally, you
      can move them up to your repository on GitHub. That makes
      them visible to everybody else.
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  git push
</pre>
    <h4>Possible Problems and Solutions</h4>
    Sometimes, git will tell you that you need a more complicated
    push comment, with some options that start with - or --. Just copy
    and paste that line to execute it. For example, you might get an 
    error message like:

<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
% git push
fatal: The current branch my-branch has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin my-branch
</pre>

    Just go ahead and do what it says:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">        
    git push --set-upstream origin my-branch
</pre>
    And occasionally, your local repository can be out of 
    sync with your GitHub repository.  If you get a
    message about "failed to push some refs" or similar, 
    without specific commands to fix it, do
    (the first command here is why we created that
    remote with your name above; make sure it's there,
    and substitute your GitHub name in the first line):
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">        
    git pull yourname
</pre>
    (If any lines are flagged as conflicts, edit those to remove the conflicts,
    then "git add" them to resolve the conflict)
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    git commit -m "merging pull back"
    git push
</pre>
    It is definitely easier to do this if you 
    have no modified files in your repository, 
    e.g. you've committed all your local changes.
    
    <a name="pull" id="pull"></a>

      <h3>Submit a Pull Request</h3>
      
      Once your changes are complete and ready to go, 
      the last step is to make your
      changes, already visible in your GitHub repository, known to
      the JMRI maintainers so that one of them can pull it into the
      main JMRI repository. To do that, you create and submit a
      "pull request" that automatically has all the needed info.

      <ul>
        <li>Login to GitHub and go to the page for your JMRI clone
        repository (yours, not the main JMRI one)</li>

        <li>There's a "Pull Request" button at the upper right of
        the file listing. Click it.</li>

        <li>On the next page, select the branch you've been working
        on and click the "Create pull request" button.</li>

        <li>Fill out the forms. A short title that describes the
        feature you've written helps other people find it. A few
        lines in the comment about what it does, how you added it,
        etc helps users understand the value of your feature.
        If you've already 
        made an entry in the draft release note (see above),
        that can be a used here.</li>

        <li>Click "Create pull request". That submits all the info,
        starts the 
        <a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml">Continuous Integration (CI) tests</a>
        and notifies the JMRI maintainers. </li>
        
        <li>One of the JMRI maintainers will check
        over your code and the test results, and then either contact you for more info
        (occasionally), or merge it into the master branch in the
        the main repository (more often). You are automatically signed up for
        notifications when things happens.</li>
        
        <li>
            <a id="labels" name="labels"></a>
        Sometimes, a maintainer will put a label on your PR
        to indicate its status. Some of the more interesting ones are:
          <ul>
            <li>"<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/After%20Next%20Test%20Release">After Next Test Release</a>" 
                and "<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/After%20Next%20Production%20Release">After Next Production Release</a>" - placed
                when a PR should be merged later for some reason
            <li>"<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/Add%20to%20Next%20Release">Add To Next Release</a>" - needs to be merged before the next release is built
            <li>"<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/dev%2Ftest%2Fpublish%20infrastructure">dev/test/publish infrastucture</a>"
                - there's a lot of automation around building
                and publishing JMRI.  This change is to that infrastructure, not the 
                released JMRI code itself.
            <li>"<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/Contribution">Contribution</a>" - On an Issue, it indicates that the Issue contains a contributed 
                file that some maintainer should 
                <a href="GitFAQ.shtml#SFnetPatches">merge via a PR</a>.
            <li>"<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/Cleanup">Cleanup</a>" - a change that improves the code, but doesn't really affect JMRI users directly
            <li>"<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/Support%20Request">Support Request</a>" - A request for help figuring something out, typically found in the Issues section.
                                Typically these items are closed if resolved, 
                                or become "Enhancement" or "Bug" items.
            <li>"<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/Enhancement">Enhancement</a>" - request that somebody make JMRI better in some way.
            <li>"<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/Bug">Bug</a>" - a problem that's bitten at least one person.
            <li>"<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/Duplicate">Duplicate</a>", 
                "<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/Invalid">Invalid</a>", 
                "<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/labels/Won%27t%20Fix">Won't Fix</a>" - items that have (typically) been closed
                                without action.  Issues and PRs never go away, but these
                                labels mark them as not intended for further consideration.
          </ul>
        If you have any questions about the use of those on your PR, 
        you can add a comment to the PR and somebody will get back to you.
        
        <li>In addition to the labels, there's a "WIP" tag. It means 
        "Work In Progress", and marks a PR as not yet ready to merge because
        additional work (usually commits) is needed before merging.
        Think of it as a blue flag on a train that indicates it's not ready to move.
        It's added at the front of the PR's title, i.e. "WIP: My Fix", by 
        editing the title with the pencil icon to the right.
        
        <li>If there are any problems found in the CI test process, you can make additional edits, 
        commit those files to the <u>same</u> branch, and push them 
        to your repository.  That'll get them included in an updated 
        version of your PR automatically, rerun the tests, etc.

        <li>Once the code gets merged, it'll automatically show up in the next
        regular test release.
      </ul>

     <p>
     Once your PR is merged, a <code>git checkout master; git pull</code>
     will bring it back around to your repository and that cycle will be complete.
     <p>
      While all this is happening, you can work on something else by creating another 
      branch and making changes there.
      But first, pick up the most recent contents of our central repository with:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">        
    git checkout master
    git pull
</pre>
      Then you can create a new branch for a new project:
 <pre style="font-family: monospace;">        
    git checkout -b another-new-feature
</pre>
     <p>just like you did at the start of this process, and continue
     to develop.</p>

    <h3>Who are these people?</h3>
    
    JMRI is the work of 
    <a href="../../../Acknowledgements.shtml">several hundred people</a>.
    Anybody can contribute their work, large or small to JMRI, either by 
    creating a PR (see above) or in other ways.  You don't need any 
    special status to create a PR and have it evaluated, just an ability
    to follow these instructions.
    
    <p>
    There's a group of people with 
    "developer"
    status on the JMRI GitHub project
    who work more generally on JMRI code, for example taking on and resolving
    <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues">Issues</a>
    opened by others. These people can assign Issues and PRs 
    to themselves, and do a few other minor things.
    Typically, once somebody has solved a couple of Issues, they'll 
    get an automated invitation to developer status from GitHub.
    These people are expected to be subscribed to the
    jmri-developers mailing list
    and to have public GitHub profiles that identify them.
    
    <p>
    A smaller group of JMRI 
    "maintainers"
    on GitHub have the ability to edit, label and close all Issues and PRs, and to merge the
    contents of PRs to the main repository. This group does the infrastructure work
    that keeps the project code moving forward while avoiding unnecessary risk to the 
    project's code and other assets.
