<p>If you don't understand HTML here is a chance to learn a little about it.
This will not make you a high paid Web Page designer, but should give you
enough knowledge to help update JMRI documents.</p>

<p>Using MSWord or Front Page to edit these .shtml documents is not a good idea
because they will probably add in their own proprietary formatting codes that
will mess things up, possibly even to the point of being unusable by JMRI.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with writing HTML, you can use whatever editing
application works for you, but if you're new to it, I suggest <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya</a> because it allows you to view the
document in two ways-- the way it will display in one pane, and the source code
behind it in another. The nice thing is you can make your edits in the
&ldquo;display&ldquo; view, and never even look at the code!</p>
<p>
If you do use an editor like Amaya, it is very important that you
set it to make minimal changes to the files you're editing.
If you use an editor that (automatically) reformats the original text,
it may not be possible to merge your changes into the common version.</p>

<p>To get started, you can drill down inside your CPU's JMRI program files to
the folder for the DecoderPro manual.
On a WinXP system, the location for this folder
looks something like this -- <span
style="font-family: monospace">C:\ProgramFiles\JMRI\help\en\manual</span>.
In this folder is a file called <span
style="font-family: monospace">index.shtml</span>. Open that file with Amaya
and look around, being careful not to change it unless you have saved a
re-named version.</p>

<h2 id="update">Updating or Creating a New Document with Amaya</h2>

<p>To UPDATE an existing document, open it in Amaya. First, save a newly-named
version of it in the same directory. For instance, if it is called <span
style="font-family: monospace">index.shtml</span>, re-name it to <span
style="font-family: monospace">index_edit.shtml</span> (that's an underscore
line using the Shift-Hyphen key). Open that file with Amaya and edit it in the
document view (not the code view). </p>

<p>You can delete, add, or change the text there. (To make it easier for the
developers to see what you have done, read about inserting and/or deleting text
below.) If you want to change the formatting of a word or phrase (for instance,
make a phrase into a Heading), select it first and then use the tools under
<span style="font-family: monospace">Elements</span> located by default on the
right side of the screen. <span
style="font-family: monospace">T<sub>1</sub></span> will make it the
largest-sized heading, <span
style="font-family: monospace">T<sub>2</sub></span> the second largest, etc. If
you are making any changes or additions to the images being used in the page,
see <a href="#linking">Linking to Images</a> below. When finished, follow the
<a href="#submit">How To Submit</a> instructions.</p>

<p>To create a NEW document, open an existing document inside the folder where
you will want your new document to be placed. Save a COPY of it in the same
directory, but add <span style="font-family: monospace">_new</span> to the end
of the name (i.e. <span style="font-family: monospace">index_new.shtml</span>).
Open that document, and delete any undesired text and/or images and type in
what you want. If there are no images to be used, proceed to <a
href="#submit">How To Submit</a>, below.</p>

<h2 id="linking">Linking to Images</h2>

<p>Images seen on your page are not inside your .shtml document, they are
actually only linked to. In the HTML code, they will look something like <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;img alt=&ldquo;description&rdquo;
src=&ldquo;images/imagename.gif&rdquo; width=&ldquo;400&rdquo;
height=&ldquo;300&rdquo;&gt;</span>). What matters here is that, before you use
Amaya to insert your image, you must first place the image file inside a folder
holding all the other images related to the document. In the example above,
this folder is named <span style="font-family: monospace">images</span> and
there is a GIF image file inside of it named <span
style="font-family: monospace">imagename.gif</span>. For more about making your
own images, see <a href="#screenshots">Creating Images from Screenshots</a>
below.</p>

<p>To insert the link for your image into your .shtml document, use Amaya's
display view, and place your cursor where you want the image to appear. From
the top menu, use <span style="font-family: monospace">Insert-Image</span>.</p>

<p><img alt="insert image" src="images/insert_pic.gif" width="468"
height="275"></p>

<p>Or you can use the <span style="font-family: monospace">Insert/Replace
Image</span> tool under <span
style="font-family: monospace">Elements</span>.</p>

<p><img alt="elements tools" src="images/elements.gif" width="500" height="171"
border="1"></p>

<p>Either way, a dialog box opens. Browse to your image file, provide a
description under Alternate Text, and press Confirm. Amaya will insert the code
needed, including the path to where the file is <strong>in relation to your
document</strong>, and the width and height of the image.</p>

<p><img alt="confirm insertion" src="images/confirm_insert.gif" width="500"
height="311"> </p>

<p>Your image will appear. Make sure that the image is in its own paragraph, or
the text around it will be beside it instead of under it. Also, because it is a
paragraph, you can format it to align left, right, or center.</p>

<p><img alt="inserted" src="images/inserted_pic.gif" width="500"
height="412"></p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: If your image is the wrong size for the page (for instance,
too small to be readable or much larger than needed), you will need to adjust
your image file and then re-insert it into the .shtml page. See <a
href="#sizing">Sizing and Saving Images</a> below.</p>

<h2 id="screenshots">Creating Images from Screen Shots</h2>
<strong>For Windows</strong> 

<p>To snag a screen shot in Windows, start by setting up the window that holds
what you want to capture. Make it take up as little space on your screen as you
can while it still shows what you want. You can take a shot of the active
window (instead of your whole desktop), by pressing the <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;Alt&gt;</span> key and the <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;Print Screen&gt;</span> key at the same
time. (Note: Depending on your keyboard, you might need to press the <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;Fn&gt;</span> or <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;Function-Lock&gt;</span> key as well.) This
puts the image on your &ldquo;clipboard&rdquo; and you can paste it into an
image-editing program such as Window's Paint or Photoshop. </p>

<p><strong>For Linux</strong></p>

<p>If your distro doesn't already have a default application that supports the
use of the &lt;<span style="font-family: monospace">Print Screen</span>&gt; and
&lt;<span style="font-family: monospace">Alt + Print Screen</span>&gt; keys you
can install <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KSnapshot</a> or your favorite
application to do your screen grabbing.</p>

<p><strong>For Mac OS X</strong></p>

<p>After setting up your shot, hold down <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;Apple + Shift + 4&gt;</span> key. When you
release them at the same time, the cursor becomes a plus sign, and you can drag
it around the area you want. When you let go, you will have an image file on
your desktop.</p>

<p><strong>Using a Third-Party Application</strong></p>

<p>I love <a
href="http://www.irfanview.com/main_download_engl.htm">IrFanView</a> for
screenshots, and it is free. With it, you can also include your mouse cursor in
your snapshot. You can also take a series of shots easily, and even make a
slideshow of them. You can tell it what file format you want the image files to
be AND where you want them to be saved before you take the shot, and that makes
it easier to work with them in a program like Paint or Photoshop.</p>

<h2 id="sizing">Sizing and Saving the Images</h2>

<p>Any changes you make to your image should be done before you use Amaya to
insert it into your document. Remember that if you change it, it needs to be
re-inserted. Make sure you save the image as one of the following filetypes:
PNG, GIF, JPG, or JPEG (not BMP or TIF), and do not use any spaces or capital
letters in the name. Generally, a good size for the width of an image is 500
pixels or less, at a web resolution of 72 pixels per inch. If you know how to
resize your images, it would be very helpful. </p>

<h2 id="submit">Submitting to Sourceforge</h2>

<p>If you understand this, you are ready to help us update the many JMRI
documents that we use for both the JMRI website and for the Help files in the
next software build. </p>

<p>
When you submit your changes to be included in future JMRI releases, they
are given a quick check and then merged into the previous content.
The check is done by using a "diff" tool to find the parts of the
file that have been changed.
To make that easier, please don't reformat pages or use an 
editor that moves lines around on its own.

<p><strong>Prepare the Files</strong></p>

<p>The proper filetype to use for JMRI has the .shtml extension. If you have
made an .html or .htm file, you can change the extension yourself to .shtml
(just ignore the warning). Don't use spaces or capital letters in your
filenames. If you are not changing or adding images, just save the file with a
variation of its original name, i.e. &ldquo;index_edit.shtml&rdquo; (that's an
underscore line using the &lt;<span
style="font-family: monospace">Shift-Hyphen</span>&gt;
key), save it where you can find it easily, and click the <a
href="#submit">Submit to Sourceforge</a> link below.</p>

<p>If you are submitting more than one file at a time (i.e. the .shtml and some
new or edited image files), then you should first copy these files into a new
folder somewhere on your hard drive, and then compress (or Zip) the folder. For
Windows XP, right click the folder, then Send To -- Compressed.</p>

<p><strong>Send to Sourceforge</strong></p>

<p>Sourceforge is a community of open-source developers and the hard-working
volunteers for the JMRI software project would welcome your help whether you
want to register or not. When you click the &ldquo;Submit to Sourceforge&rdquo;
link below, you will be taken to a page that has a link called &ldquo;Add new
Artifact.&rdquo; If you do this without being a logged-in user, you can submit
your file(s) anonymously. If you plan to do a lot of submissions, we suggest
you first use the &ldquo;Log In&rdquo; link on the top-right side, and then
&ldquo;Create an Account.&rdquo; This will allow you to keep track of what you
have submitted, and allow others to see who is contributing their time. Once
you have logged in with your new username, you can return to the proper page by
going back two times in your browser. Either way, when you click the &ldquo;Add
New Artifact&rdquo; link, you only need to provide a brief description of what
you are sending, and then upload your file or compressed folder. </p>

href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=26788&amp;atid=388315">Submit to
SourceForge</a>. </p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Using a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor like Amaya will allow
even a novice to assist the JMRI developers correct and maintain the many pages
used for both the Website and the Help Pages in the JMRI program releases.
Keeping it simple is key! You needn't be concerned with how it looks while you
are working on it, as there is a separate Cascading Style Sheet (a CSS
document) that will control the layout and formatting of everything. It is
helpful enough to assist in the re-writing and spell-checking and clarification
of the existing text, and even more helpful to add pages (and images) you feel
are needed.</p>
