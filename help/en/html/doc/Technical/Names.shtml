      <h1>JMRI: Names and Naming</h1>This page discusses how JMRI
      objects are named, how those names are used to reference the
      objects (hardware and software), and how user-readable names
      are used.

      <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.7.4</span>
        <b>As of March 2017, we have changed
        the allowable user names: They can't have leading or trailing spaces.  
        If leading or trailing spaces are entered, they'll be "trimmed" off.</b> 
        
      <h2>What's in a name?</h2>Why do we need names at all, rather
      than just references within the code? There are several
      important uses:

      <ol>
        <li>When working with user input, e.g. typing a number in a
        field, the code will need to know how to map the
        user-provided info onto objects. Sometimes the user will
        want to name objects with arbitrary user names, e.g. "East
        Lockport Turnout". These can't be known until their mapping
        to hardware has been made. But other times these will be
        de-novo identifications that the code must understand, e.g.
        something that means "LocoNet Turnout 23".</li>

        <li>We imagine that configurations will be stored in XML
        files, in a symbolic form. Names are a convenient way to
        connect objects and object references in that kind of
        configuration.</li>
      </ol><a name="type" id="type"></a>

      <h2>Items with names</h2>
      There are lots of things that might need names:

      <ul>
        <li>Aspects for signals</li>

        <li>Blocks (track segments)</li>

        <li>Conditionals (for logiX, although these are not entirely named beans)</li>

        <li>signal Heads</li>

        <li>Lights (a type of output)</li>

        <li>Memories</li>

        <li>Outputs</li>

        <li>Power districts and subdistricts</li>

        <li>Routes</li>

        <li>input Sensors</li>

        <li>Turnouts</li>

        <li>logiX</li>
      </ul>Some of these are associated with a specific hardware
      device, e.g. a particular turnout. Others are more virtual,
      e.g. a route, which is a collection on control information
      within the program.

      <h2>System and User Names</h2>JMRI users both "system names"
      and "user names" to reference things.

      <p>We want users to be able to call things what they want.
      Names like "p(24,23)*" are not useful. Every named item can
      therefore have a "user name", which is an entirely free-form
      string. You can put whatever you want in there, so long as
      it's not a duplicate of the user name given to something else. For
      example, you might call a Turnout "West Yard Lead" or
      "Turnout 32" or "Green Wire from Controller" or whatever.</p>

      <p>At the same time, we need a shorthand name, really a
      unique identifier, to talk about specific objects. This
      doesn't have to be convenient, but does have to have a clear
      mapping from name to object and back. For example, we need a
      very specific way to identify "LocoNet Turnout 23". We call
      these "system names". JMRI code will map these to and from
      whatever information the hardware may need.</p>

      <h2>System Name Format</h2>
      
      A system name is formed from a
      short "system prefix" representing the hardware system, followed by a
      single upper case "type letter" indicating the type of the object, 
      followed by a
      system- and type-specific "suffix string" identifying a specific
      object. 
      <ul>
        <li>The system prefix is a single uppercase or lowercase letter, optionally followed
            by one or more digits. Special characters are not allowed.
            This simple form allows us to always fine the system prefix
            and type letter even if we don't know the full list of 
            hardware systems involved.
        <li>The type letter defines the type of model-railroad object, 
            such as (T)urnout or (S)ensor.
        <li>The suffix string is meant to be related to the hardware
            addressing for the specific hardware system, but is otherwise unconstrained.
            Some are simple numbers, such as a device address. Others
            are much more complicated strings to carry more complex 
            information.
      </ul>

      <p>Examples:</p>

      Note: These assume the default values of system prefix letters,
      but they certainly could have been defined to be something else.
      
      <ul>
        <li>LT23 - <u>L</u>ocoNet <u>T</u>urnout <u>23</u>.</li>
        <li>L2T23 - <u>T</u>urnout <u>23</u> on the second <u>L</u>ocoNet connection.</li>

        <li>CS2012 - A <u>C</u>/MRI <u>S</u>ensor
            (input line) addressed as 2012, which means the 12th pin on  
            on the node with address 2.</li>
      </ul>
      
      Note that there is no assumption of pattern to the
      names; they don't have to be assigned monotonically, nor are
      they restricted to a single system. 
      
      <a name="hardware" id="hardware"></a>
      <h3>System Prefix</h3>
      
      Originally, the "hardware prefix" was
      a single uppercase letter identifying a single system
      connection: L for LocoNet, N for NCE, etc. The default
      letters for those are listed below. This is still by far the
      most common use: Most model railroads have a single
      connection, and just use the default letter.

      <p>The JMRI code is much more flexible than that, however.
      This allows it to deal with multiple system connections and
      overlaps of letters (such as the multiple possibilities
      defined for "D" or "M" below). You change the letter associated with
      a system connection in the preferences to any other uppercase or lowercase
      letter. You can call your NCE connection "P" if you want to.
      If you have two of them, you can call one "X" and the other
      "Y". You can also use an upper case letter followed by
      digits, e.g. "N1" and "N2".</p>

      <h4>Default System Letters</h4>Note that some of these are
      placeholders, and have no underlying implementation. (Links

      <h3>Device type letters</h3>
      
      Note that some of these are
      placeholders, and have no underlying implementation. Also,
      there is no guarantee that any given hardware system will
      ever implement all of them.

      <ul>
        <li>A Audio - an internal software object that holds
        information about a sound sample to be placed at a specific
        position in 3d space</li>

        <li>B Block - A software object that keeps track of the
        contents of a specific block of track</li>

        <li>D iDentity - A software object that holds information
        about an identity tag that is, typically, attached to a
        piece of rolling stock. These objects are not
        system-specific but are Internal objects, hence have system
        names commencing with ID. The underlying hardware will use
        Reporter objects to communicate back to JMRI when a
        specific iDentity object has been seen.</li>

        <li>F signal mast (F is not particularly mnemonic; maybe a
        mast with two heads looks like an F from the side? All the
        good letters were taken)</li>

        <li>H signal Head - One part of a signal (which may have
        multiple heads). Also interpreted to include indicators on
        control panels that are acting to display signal
        aspects</li>

        <li>M Memory - As yet, this has no real equivalent in the
        layout hardware, but is used as a place to store
        information temporarily and display it on panels, etc.</li>

        <li>L Light - another form of output, used to e.g. control
        lights on a layout</li>

        <li>P Power manager i.e. layout, district, subdistrict; not
        all systems distinguish between these, so the device type
        letter doesn't either. The system-specific part of the name
        can. For example, the system specific part might be B for
        main layout power, e.g. LPB or S42 for subdistrict channel
        2 on card 4, e.g. LPS42.</li>

        <li>R Reporters - a general purpose mechanism for reporting
        complicated information from the layout, e.g. locomotive
        identification from some transponding hardware, RFID tag
        numbers, etc.</li>

        <li>S Sensors - general purpose input sensors that can
        generally be either ACTIVE or INACTIVE. This is most
        commonly used for block occupancy detectors.</li>

        <li>T Turnout - actually a general purpose output on the
        layout</li>

        <li>X logiX - a set of logic equations used to control the
        layout</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="systeminfo" id="systeminfo"></a>
      <h3>System-specific suffix</h3>
      <p>"Internal" objects can also be addressed and manipulated,
        but they don't have a strict correspondence with some
        hardware on the layout. For example, if a signal head is
        implemented as three different outputs, LT1, LT2 and LT3, the
        signal head object might be called IH3. 
        
     <a name="special" id=
                "special"></a></p>
      <p>Each different hardware system
      can specify the "suffix string" that follows the system and type
      letters. Generally, these are small numbers, but their exact
      meaning is very system-specific. For more information, please

      <h2>Naming Conventions For Automated Use</h2>Some
      higher-level constructs create their own items. For example,
      a "Sensor Group" is really just a collection of Routes that
      implements the sensor group logic; there is no specific
      object in the program that implements the sensor group.
      Instead, when the user creates sensor group "my group", a
      series of routes with system names like:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
SENSOR GROUP:my group:LS1
SENSOR GROUP:my group:LS2
</pre>
    are created which implements the group. The sensor group tool
    knows to look for routes of this name.

      <p>To make this possible, two informal rules are used:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Users should not use the : (colon, ASCII 0x3A), "
        (double quote, ASCII 0x22), nor $ (dollar sign, ASCII 0x24
        ) characters in their system or user names. Automatic tools
        should use at least one of these to make sure they don't
        collide with user-selected names. Quotes should always be
        used in pairs to allow nesting.</li>

        <li>Tools that use this method have their tool name in any
        system names they create, as "SENSOR GROUP" was used
        above.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The list of tools currently working this way is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Logix - auto-generated 
            <a href="http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/java/src/jmri/Logix.html">Logix</a> 
            system names are of the form IX:AUTO:0001</li>
        <li>SENSOR GROUPS - <a href=
        "http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/sensorgroup/package-summary.html">
        jmri.jmrit.sensorgroup</a></li>

        <li>SignalHeads - particularly the <a href=
        "http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/implementation/SE8cSignalHead.html">
        SE8C signal head</a></li>

        <li>USS CTC - <a href=
        "http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/package-summary.html">
        jmri.jmrit.ussctc</a></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Some devices are not really named, as there's no idea
        of more than one yet. The DCC programmer is the first
        example, but there may be others.</li>

        <li><a href="http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/java/src/jmri/Conditional.html">Conditionals</a>
        are a special case.  Although they have things called
        "System Names" and "User Names", they don't really obey the 
        conventions here.  See the 
        <a href="http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/java/src/jmri/ConditionalManager.html">ConditionalManager Javadoc</a>
        for more information.</li>
        
        <li>The system name convention doesn't provide a specific
        way to identify more than one adapter of a given type. E.g.
        if you're connected to more than one LocoNet, or more than
        one command station of any single type, you can either give
        the second one a separate letter (L, then M) or you can
        identify the 2nd one with a modifier (L, then L2). That's a
        bit ambiguous, but there are proponents of both approaches
        so we make them both available.</li>

        <li>There's no provision for a single program to deal with
        more than one layout. If that's needed, we'll have to
        understand what the program is trying to do.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <a name="programmers" id="programmers"></a>
      <h2>For Programmers</h2>
      
      <h3>Normalized form of Names, and how to work with it</h3>
      
          After multiple long discussions, we decided that both system and user names 
          should be kept in a "normal" form which enforces certain restrictions.
          For user names, that's that leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs) 
          are not allowed.  For system names, it depends on the system, but 
          at least the system-prefix and type letter must be correct.
          
          <p>
          The code to make sure that names are in normal form 
          has been localized to a single routine for user names:
          <br>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
          String userName = NamedBean.normalizeUserName(input);
</pre><br>
          Because system names may vary from type to type 
          and manager to manager, this is manager-specific for them:
          <br>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
          String systemName = manager.normalizeSystemName(input);
</pre><br>
          For more information, see the Javadoc for
            <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBean.html#normalizeUserName-java.lang.String-">normalizeUserName</a>
            and
            <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/Manager.html#normalizeSystemName-java.lang.String-">normalizeSystemName</a>
      
        <p>
        In general, it's better to use an input method that already handles all this.  Two are available
        now:
        <ul>
        <li>JComboBox format:
            <a href="images/ComboBox.png"><img src="images/ComboBox.png" align="right" height="50" width="75"/></a>
            
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        import jmri.util.swing.JmriBeanComboBox;

        // the first argument is the manager, the 2nd is a bean to select or null
        // the third determines how the beans are displayed
        selectComboBox = new <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/swing/JmriBeanComboBox.html">JmriBeanComboBox</a>(InstanceManager.getDefault(SensorManager.class), 
                                                    currentSensor, 
                                                    <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/swing/JmriBeanComboBox.DisplayOptions.html">JmriBeanComboBox.DisplayOptions</a>.DISPLAYNAME)
        
        // to get the selected item, depending on what you want:
        selectComboBox.getNamedBean()                                       
        selectComboBox.getSystemName()                                       
        selectComboBox.getUserName()                                        
        selectComboBox.getDisplayName()                                       
</pre>

        <li>Table format:
            <a href="images/TableSelector.png"><img src="images/TableSelector.png" align="right" height="119" width="175"/></a>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">

        import jmri.jmrit.picker.*;
        <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/picker/PickListModel.html">PickListModel</a> tableModel = <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/picker/PickListModel.html">PickListModel</a>.sensorPickModelInstance(); // or another type
        <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/picker/PickSinglePane.html">PickSinglePane</a> panel = new <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/picker/PickSinglePane.html">PickSinglePane</a>(tableModel);
            
        // to get the selected item as a NamedBeanHandle&lt;T&gt;
        panel.getSelectedBeanHandle();

        // you can listen for a selected value by inheriting from ListSelectionListener 
        // and registering with panel.getTable().getSelectionModel().addListSelectionListener(this)
        @Override
        public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent e) {
            System.out.println("  Selected: "+panel.getSelectedBeanHandle());
        }
</pre>
        This allows the user to select either the system name or (non-blank) user name in a row,
        which then becomes the preferred name for the resulting

      <h3>System Name Comparisons</h3>
      
        System names are compared and sorted in multiple places: as labels for table rows, 
        in selection boxes and lists, etc.  We have two <code>java.util.Comparator&lt;&gt;</code>
        implementations to handle this:
        <ul>
            <li><code>SystemNameComparator</code> - a comparison on Strings
            <li><code>NamedBeanComparator</code> - a comparison on the NamedBeans themselves
        </ul>
        Please use one of these whenever you need to compare or sort by system names to keep the complexity in one place.
        <p>
        Both of them sort first by system connection prefix, to group all the objects from one system together.
        If there are objects of multiple types, the type letter is put in alphabetical order next.
        Finally, the system-specific suffix is sorted.
        <p>
        Because it works with String values, <code>SystemNameComparator</code> can only
        do a default ordering of the system-specific suffix; it can't do anything that
        uses any information about the system-specific meaning of that string. It therefore
        uses an alphanumeric-by-chunks sort.
        Because it's comparing on the actual NamedBean objects, <code>NamedBeanComparator</code>
        can do more specific comparisons:  It knows what the C/MRI suffixes in 
        "CT2003" and "C2B2" mean and can take that into account.
        <p>
        Therefore, if you can, do the sort/comparison with <code>NamedBeanComparator</code> and
        then convert to Strings, rather than converting NamedBeans to Strings and using 
        <code>SystemNameComparator</code>.
        <p>
        Also, if you've created a system that has complex information in the suffix,
        please have your <code>NamedBean</code> subclasses implement a system-specific
        version of the
        <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/NamedBean.html#compareSystemNameSuffix-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-jmri.NamedBean-">compareSystemNameSuffix()</a>
        method in <code>NamedBean</code>.
        For an example, see the bottom of jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.SerialTurnout
        and jmri.jmrix.cmri.serial.SerialTurnoutTest.
