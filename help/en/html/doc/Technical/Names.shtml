<H1>JMRI: Names and Naming</H1>

This page discusses how JMRI objects are named, how those names are
used to reference the objects (hardware and software), and 
how user-readable names are used.

<h2>What's in a name?</h2>

Why do we need names at all, rather than just references within the code?
There are several important uses:
<OL>
<LI>When working with user input, e.g. typing a number in a field, 
the code will need to know how to map the user-provided info
onto objects. Sometimes the user will want to name objects
with arbitrary user names, e.g. "East Lockport Turnout". 
These can't be known until their mapping to hardware has been made. 
But other times these will be de-novo identifications that the 
code must understand, e.g. something that means "LocoNet Turnout 23".

<LI>We imagine that configurations will be stored in XML files,
in a symbolic form. Names are a convenient way to connect objects
and object references in that kind of configuration.
</OL>

<a name="type" id="type"></a>
<H2>Items with names</h2>
There are lots of things that might need names:
<UL>
<LI>Aspects for signals
<LI>Blocks (track segments)
<LI>signal Heads
<LI>Lights (a type of output)
<LI>Memories
<LI>Outputs
<LI>Power districts and subdistricts
<LI>Routes
<LI>input Sensors
<LI>Turnouts
<LI>logiX
</UL>

Some of these are associated with a specific hardware device, e.g. a particular
turnout.  Others are more virtual, e.g. a route, which is a collection on control
information within the program.

<h2>System and User Names</h2>

JMRI users both "system names" and "user names" to reference things.

<P>
We want users to be able to call things what they want.
Names like "p(24,23)*" are not useful.  Every named item will therefore
have a "user name", which is an entirely free-form string. You can put
whatever you want in there, so long as it's not a duplicate of the name
given to something else.  For example, you might call a Turnout "West Yard Lead"
or "Turnout 32" or "Green Wire from Controller" or whatever.

<P>
At the same time, we need a shorthand name, really a unique identifier, 
to talk about specific objects.  This doesn't have to be convenient, but
does have to have a clear mapping from name to object and back.  For example,
we need a very specific way to identify "LocoNet Turnout 23".  We call these
"system names".  JMRI code will map these to and from whatever information
the hardware may need.

<H2>System Name Format</h2>

A system name is formed from a short prefix representing the hardware system, 
followed by a single upper case letter indicating the type, 
followed by system- and type-specific string identifying a specific object. 
The string is meant to be related to the hardware addressing, but
is otherwise unconstrained.
<P>
Examples:
<UL>
<LI>LT23 - <u>L</u>ocoNet <u>T</u>urnout <u>23</u>.  
<LI>CS12 - The <u>12</u>th <u>C</u>/MRI <u>S</u>ensor (input line).
</ul>

Note that there is no assumption of pattern to the names; they don't have
to be assigned monotonically, nor are they restricted to a single system.

<a name="hardware" id="hardware"></a>
<H3>Hardware Prefix</h3>
Originally, the "hardware prefix" was a single uppercase letter
identifying a single system connection: L for LocoNet, N for NCE, etc.
The default letters for those are listed below.
This is still by far the most common use:  Most model railroads have a single
connection, and just use the default letter.

<p>
The JMRI code is much more flexible than that, however.  This allows it to
deal with multiple system connections and overlaps of letters (such as the
multiple possibilities defined for "M" below). You change the letter
associated with a system connection in the preferences to any other
uppercase letter.  You can call your NCE connection &quot;P&quot; if you
want to.  If you have two of them, you can call one &quot;X&quot; and 
the other &quot;Y&quot;.  You can also use an upper case letter followed
by digits, e.g. &quot;N1&quot; and &quot;N2&quot;.

<h4>Default System Letters</h4>
Note that some of these are placeholders, and have no underlying implementation.

<H3>Device type letters</h3>
Note that some of these are placeholders, and have no underlying implementation. Also, 
there is no guarantee that any given hardware system will ever implement all of them.

<ul>

<li>A Audio - an internal software object that holds information about a sound
sample to be placed at a specific position in 3d space

<li>B Block - A software object that keeps track of the contents of a specific block 
of track

<li>D iDentity - A software object that holds information about an identity tag
that is, typically, attached to a piece of rolling stock.  These objects are not
system-specific but are Internal objects, hence have system names commencing with
ID.  The underlying hardware will use Reporter objects to communicate back to
JMRI when a specific iDentity object has been seen.

<LI>F signal mast (F is not particularly mnemonic; maybe a mast with two heads
looks like an F from the side?  All the good letters were taken)

<LI>H signal Head - One part of a signal (which may have multiple heads).  
Also interpreted to include indicators on control panels that
are acting to display signal aspects

<LI>M Memory - As yet, this has no real equivalent in the layout hardware,
but is used as a place to store information temporarily and display it on panels, etc.

<LI>L Light - another form of output, used to e.g. control lights on a layout

<LI>P Power manager i.e. layout, district, subdistrict; not all systems 
distinguish between these,
so the device type letter doesn't either.  The system-specific part of the name
can. For example, the system specific part might be B for main layout power, e.g. 
LPB or S42 for subdistrict channel 2 on card 4, e.g. LPS42.

<LI>R Reporters - a general purpose mechanism for reporting complicated information
from the layout, e.g. locomotive identification from some transponding hardware,
RFID tag numbers, etc.

<LI>S Sensors - general purpose input sensors that can generally
be either ACTIVE or INACTIVE. This is most commonly used for block occupancy
detectors.

<LI>T Turnout - actually a general purpose output on the layout

<LI>X logiX - a set of logic equations used to control the layout
</ul>

<a name="systeminfo" id="systeminfo"></a>
<h3>System-specific info</H3>
Each different hardware system can specify the "string" that follows the system and type 
letters.  Generally, these are small numbers, but their exact meaning is very system-specific.
For more information, please see the specific pages for
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../../hardware/cmri/CMRI.shtml#numbers">C/MRI</a>
<LI><A HREF="../../hardware/loconet/Addressing.shtml">Digitrax LocoNet</a>
<LI><A HREF="../../hardware/grapevine/Names.shtml">Grapevine</a>
<LI><A HREF="../../hardware/XPressNet/XNetAddressing.shtml ">Lenz XPressNet</a>
<LI><A HREF="../../hardware/nce/NCE.shtml#names">NCE</a>
<LI><A HREF="../../hardware/powerline/Names.shtml">Powerline adapters, e.g, X10, Insteon</a>
</UL>
(If you find any missing, please 
<a href="getgitcode.shtml#propose">add a reference</a>)
</UL>

<P>
"Internal" objects can also be addressed and manipulated, but they don't have a strict
correspondence with some hardware on the layout.  For example, if a signal head
is implemented as three different outputs, LT1, LT2 and LT3, the signal head object
might be called IH3.

<H2>Naming Conventions For Automated Use</h2>

Some higher-level constructs create their own items.  For example, a
"Sensor Group"
is really just a collection of
Routes
that implements the sensor group logic; there is no specific object in the
program that implements the sensor group. Instead, when the user
creates sensor group "my group", a series of routes with system names like:
<code><pre>
SENSOR GROUP:my group:LS1
SENSOR GROUP:my group:LS2
</pre></code>
are created which implements the group. The sensor group tool knows to look
for routes of this name.
<P>
To make this possible, two informal rules are used:
<UL>
<LI>Users should not use the : (colon, ASCII 0x3A),
&quot; (double quote, ASCII 0x22),
nor 
$ (dollar sign, ASCII 0x24 ) 
characters in their system or user names.
Automatic tools should use at least one of these to make sure they don't collide
with user-selected names. Quotes should always be used in pairs to allow nesting.

<LI>Tools that use this method have their tool name in any system names
they create, as "SENSOR GROUP" was used above.
</UL>
<P>
The list of tools currently working this way is:
<UL>
<LI>SENSOR GROUPS - <a href="http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/sensorgroup/package-summary.html">jmri.jmrit.sensorgroup</a>
<LI>USS CTC - <a href="http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/package-summary.html">jmri.jmrit.ussctc</a>
<LI>SignalHeads - particularly the <a href="http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/implementation/SE8cSignalHead.html">SE8C signal head</a>
</UL>

<H2>Notes</h2>
<UL>

<LI>Some devices are not really named, as there's no idea of more than one yet.
The DCC programmer is the first example, but there may be others.

<LI>The system name convention doesn't provide a specific way to identify more
than one adapter of a given type.  E.g. if you're connected to more than
one LocoNet, or more than one command station of any single type, 
you can either give the second one a separate letter (L, then M) or 
you can identify the 2nd one with a modifier (L, then L2).
That's a bit ambiguous, but there are proponents of both approaches so we make them
both available.

<LI>There's no provision for a single program to deal with more
than one layout.  If that's needed, we'll have to understand what 
the program is trying to do.
