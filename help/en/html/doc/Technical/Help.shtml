		    <H1>JMRI: Use of JavaHelp</H1>

This page talks about technical aspects of how JMRI provides help
information using JavaHelp and JHelpDev.


<h2>Organization of the help files</h2>

The help files are located in the "help" directory
within the JMRI distribution directory.
<P>
Within that, all the English-language files are located
within the "en" subdirectory.  Eventually, this will
let us internationalize the help pages.
<P>
Within that, there are several file trees:
<UL>
<LI>package - organized like the source package tree,
this contains code-specific help files for e.g. a particular
window or component.
<LI>html - general descriptions, tutorials, etc.
<LI>DecoderProManual - a version of the DecoderPro manual reformatted for 
use in the help system.
</UL>

<a name="limitations">
<h3>Limitations of JavaHelp HTML</h3></a>

JavaHelp displays "plain old HTML", without providing some of the
syntactic sugar provided by many browsers to allow poor HTML to render.
In particular, there are a couple things to watch for.
<ul>
<li>Anchor tags can't be self contained. Specifically,
<code><pre>
&lt;a id="foo"/&gt;Foo!
</pre></code>
needs to be replaced by
<code><pre>
&lt;a name="foo"&gt;Foo!&lt;/a&gt;
</pre></code>
The indicator that you have to do this is an
&lt; character just appearing on the rendered page.

<li>Anchors also need to use the "name" attribute rather than
the "id" attribute.  See the item above for an example.

<li>You can't count on any particular location for your files
on the local machine, so all links to other help pages need to be relative.

<li>Links to web pages outside the help system work,
but JavaHelp can't display PDF files.  Links to those 
should be shown explicitly as links, so they can be copied to
an outside web browser.  (We hope to eventually have an automated
solution to make this work better)

</ul>

<h2>Web access to help</h2>

It's inconvenient to have to maintain two separate web pages for the
main web site and the help system.  To reduce the need for that, we
use a particular form for the web pages in the help system.
<UL>
<LI>Use ".shtml" file extensions so that
the main web servers will search the files for
<A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html">server-side includes</a>.
<li>Include the top- and bottom-matter from the
help/en/TemplateBar.shtml and help/en/TemplatePlain.shtml
files, depending on whether or not you want to include a "Sidebar"
via a file of the same name.
</UL>

<h2>Access in the code</h2>

Within the JMRI code, access the help system comes
via the jmri.util.HelpUtil class.
(For historical reasons, there's a little bit of code
in apps.Apps, but you should ignore that).
<P>
The easiest way to add a help menu to a 
frame is to have it be a JmriJFrame (which you 
should do anyway), and call addHelpMenu(...)
after you've built any other menus.

<P>
By convention, we use a similar file tree for 
the source code and help files.  For example,
the <code>jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame</code>
class inherits from JmriJFrame, and adds a help menu with the line
<PRE>
<CODE>
  addHelpMenu("package.jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame", true);
</CODE>
</PRE>
The help file is then located at 
<code>help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/simpleclock/SimpleClockFrame.shtml</code>.
<P>
A number of help files have been put in place without any contents;
hopefully some users will edit them and contribute them back.


<h2>Creating the control files with JHelpDev</h2>

JavaHelp uses various XML files to 
control how the table of contents and index are displayed.
We create those with
<A HREF="http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev</a>.
Please don't edit them manually.

<P>
To do this:
<OL>
<LI>You have to put some files in your help/en directory 
Download 
<A HREF="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JHelpDevTool.2.zip?download">this .zip archive</a>
and put in in your project's help/en directory, then expand it.
It should create a jhelpdev.jar file, and a lib directory 
containing additional .jar files.  
These files don't show up in CVS, for various reasons.

<li>It's important that you update the configuration files
from CVS before running the tool.  The configuration info is 
complicated, and a CVS merge may not go well later.
<br/>
<code>cvs -q update Map.jhm *.xml</code>

<LI>Start the tool by clicking on the jhelpdev.jar file.

<LI>Once the window appears, select "Open Project" under the "File" menu.

<LI>Navigate to the "help" directory in your checked out copy of the code, 
then the "en" directory within that, then select the "JHelpDev.xml" file 
and click "Open".

<LI>Click the "Create All" button to recreate the maps, index, etc.

<li>Then, back on the command line and in the help/en directory, invoke
"ant" to create the web index and table of contents pages.
</OL>

<p>
The various control files that JavaHelp uses are stored in CVS, 
so once you've done this CVS will show them as modified.  
Please check them in when you check in new help files so other 
people don't have to recreate those control files for themselves.
<P>
You can also use the tool to add them to the table of contents, etc, if you'd like. 
There's more info on how to do that on the
<a href="http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev web site</a>.
