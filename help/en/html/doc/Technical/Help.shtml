      <h1>JMRI Code: Use of JavaHelp</h1>
      
      This page talks about technical
      aspects of how JMRI provides help information using <a href=
      "https://javahelp.java.net">JavaHelp</a> and <a href=
      "http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev</a>.      
      
      <h2>Organization of the help files</h2>The help files are
      located in the "help" directory within the JMRI distribution
      directory.

      <p>The master copy of this is stored in our repository as the
      "help" directory in the JMRI code repository. This means to
      get your own local copy, just follow the steps on the
      "<a href="getgitcode.shtml">getting the code</a>" page.</p>

      <p>Within that, all the English-language files are located
      within the "en" subdirectory. Eventually, this will let us
      internationalize the help pages.</p>

      <p>Within that, there are several file trees:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>package - organized like the source package tree, this
        contains code-specific help files for e.g. a particular
        window or component. For example, a window that's created
        by the <code>jmri.jmrit.speedometer.SpeedometerFrame</code>
        class (from the
        <code>src/jmri/jmrit/speedometer/SpeedometerFrame.java</code>
        file) should have its window-specific help in a file at
        <code>package/jmri/jmrit/speedometer/SpeedometerFrame.shtml</code>.</li>

        <li>html - general descriptions, tutorials, etc. This in
        turn in organized into directories that represent general
        areas.</li>

        <li>manual - the most recent version of the DecoderPro et
        al manuals reformatted for use in the help system. (Older
        ones are stored in the <a href="WebSite.shtml">main web
        site</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      In the long run, we want only two branches to this
      structure: the "package" part of the tree for help
      information that is specific to a particular piece of code,
      and another part of the tree for more general information.
      (It's a religious issue whether that 2nd part should be
      called "html" or "manual"; the key thing is we end up with
      just one). The web is meant to be a <em>web</em>, with many
      paths through it to reach content. The second part of the
      tree should also be organized as "one page, one topic", with
      links to connect them as needed.

      <a name="limitations" id="limitations"></a>
      <p>All the page formatting on JMRI help and other web
      pages is done through included CSS files, originally created by
      John Plocher. These are included from "/css" via 
      Server-Side Includes (SSI).  The main file is at
      <a href="http://jmri.org/css/default.css">/css/default.css</a>
      and works with a few other files in that same directory.
      Because JavaHelp ignores SSI, the CSS formatting
      is ignored when JavaHelp is displaying the pages within the JMRI itself.
      In that case, JavaHelp provides the formatting.

      <h3>Limitations of JavaHelp HTML</h3>
      JavaHelp displays "plain
      old HTML 4.0", without providing some of the syntactic sugar
      provided by many browsers to allow poor HTML to render. 
      Do not include any particular formatting options, specifically
      including embedded CSS commands. 
      There are a couple of specific things to watch for:

      <ul>
        <li>Anchor tags need a specific format. Specifically, they
        should be written
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
&lt;a name="pull"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>around text content only. It's OK to be empty between the
open and close tags. It's not OK to combine them into a single
<code>&lt;a name="pull"/&gt;</code> tag; don't do that, as it
confuses JavaHelp.

          <p>For example, to put an anchor on a heading, do</p>
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="foo"&gt;Foo!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>

          <p>Note: Incorrectly structured anchor tags (not like the
          above) often cause just a &lt; character appearing by
          itself on the rendered help page.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Anchors need to use the "name" attribute rather than
        the "id" attribute. See the item above for an example.</li>

        <li>Do not use spaces or <code>%20</code> in anchor names.
        If you must use a phrase for a name, use the underscore character:
        "This_Anchor", not "This Anchor.</li>

        <li>You can use the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element, or
        the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element, but you can't use
        both together. <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> is good for
        highlighting in-line text as being code (like we've used it
        here); <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> is good for making a block
        of inline HTML or Java look right. To give a code-like
        appearance to a block, wrap it in <code>&lt;pre
        style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;</code></li>

        <li>You can't count on any particular location for your
        files on the local machine, so all links to other help
        pages need to be relative.</li>

        <li>Links to web pages outside the help system work. In
        most cases they'll be automatically opened in an outside
        web browser.</li>
      </ul><a name="web" id="web"></a>

      <a id="check"></a>
      <h3>Checking Your Changes</h3>
      
      The 
      <a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml">Continuous Integration</a>
      process checks all changes to JMRI Help files to make
      sure they're OK.  If you'd like to run that same check
      while you're working, do:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">   
    ant scanhelp   
</pre>

      <h2>Web access to help</h2>
      It's inconvenient to have to
      maintain two separate web pages for the main web site and the
      help system. To reduce the need for that, we use a particular
      form for the web pages in the help system.

      <ul>
        <li>Use ".shtml" file extensions so that the main web
        servers will search the files for <a href=
        "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html">server-side
        includes</a>.</li>

        <li>When you create a new page, start with a copy of either
        the help/en/TemplateBar.shtml or
        help/en/TemplatePlain.shtml template file, depending on
        whether or not you want to include a "Sidebar" via a file
        of the same name. This will put the proper top and bottom
        matter in place to get the page properly displayed.</li>
      </ul><a name="code" id="code"></a>

      <h2>Access in the code</h2>
      Within the JMRI code, access the
      help system comes via the jmri.util.HelpUtil class. (For
      historical reasons, there's a little bit of code in
      apps.Apps, but you should ignore that).

      <p>The easiest way to add a help menu to a frame is to have
      it be a JmriJFrame (which you should do anyway), and call
      addHelpMenu(...) after you've built any other menus.</p>

      <p>By convention, we use a similar file tree for the source
      code and help files. For example, the
      <code>jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame</code> class
      inherits from JmriJFrame, and adds a help menu with the
      line</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  addHelpMenu("package.jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame", true);
</pre>The help file is then located at
<code>help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/simpleclock/SimpleClockFrame.shtml</code>.
      <p>You should add the new page to the JHelpDev index to have JMRI
      accept it as a Help target (see next the heading).</p>
      <p>A number of help files have been put in place without any
      contents; hopefully some users will edit them and contribute
      them back. <a name="jhelpdev" id="jhelpdev"></a></p>

      <h2>Creating the control files with JHelpDev</h2>
      JavaHelp
      uses various XML files to control how the table of contents
      and index are displayed. We create those with <a href=
      "http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev</a>. Please don't
      edit them manually.

      <p>JHelpDev is now included in the JMRI dist. To use the
      tool:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you've updated to the most recent version in
        the code repository before getting started.</li>

        <li>You can run in batch mode by running <code>ant</code>
        from the command line in the <code>help/en/</code>
        directory. It'll still pop windows, but should run 
        to completion by itself.  It might take a minute or so.</li>
        
        <li>If you'd like to operate it manually, please 
        follow the rest of these bullets.
        (Or if using Eclipse, right-click on the
        help/en/build.xml file and select Run As Ant Build.)</li>
        
        <li>Start the tool by clicking on the jhelpdev.jar file.
        (If that doesn't work, try running either JHelpDev.csh or
        JHelpDev.bat, depending on what kind of computer you
        have)</li>

        <li>Once the window appears, select "Open Project" under
        the "File" menu.</li>

        <li>Navigate to the "help" directory in your checked out
        copy of the code, then the "en" directory within that, then
        select the "JHelpDev.xml" file and click "Open".</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">
          <p>You may get a message about "[Fatal Error]
          index.html:1:3: The markup declarations contained or
          pointed to by the document type declaration must be
          well-formed." Although it says it's fatal, it's really
          not a problem. Just ignore it. On startup the Map (a file
          containing the JHelpDev index of all anchors in the JMRI
          help system) is regenerated.</p>
        </li>

        <li>By clicking the "Index Editor" tab or the "TOC Editor"
        tab, review and update the Help entries. A red line marks a
        hyperlink that JHelpDev can't locate on disk. Right-click
        on such a line to open the Edit context menu.</li>

        <li>Click the "Create All" button to recreate the TOC,
        Index, etc.</li>

        <li>Then, back on the command line and in the help/en
        directory, invoke "ant index TOC" to create the web index and table
        of contents pages. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>The various control files that JavaHelp uses are stored in
      our code repository, so once you've done this they will show
      as modified. Please check them in when you check in new Help
      files so other people don't have to recreate those control
      files for themselves. <a name="tocAndIndex" id=
      "tocAndIndex"></a></p>

      <h3>Table of Contents and Index</h3>
      Java Help includes a
      <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/webtoc.shtml">table of
      contents</a> and an <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/help/en/webindex.shtml">index</a>. These are
      both available as hyperlinks on the web, and provided via a
      nicer user interface when using JavaHelp in the program.

      <p>The underlying information must be manually maintained in
      the help/en/JmriHelp_enTOC.xml and
      help/en/JmriHelp_enIndex.xml files, respectively. JHelpDev
      then makes the files that Java Help needs, and an "ant" step
      in the directory makes the webtoc.shtml and webindex.shtml
      files that are displayed on the web.</p>

      <p>Note: This means you should not manually change the
      webToc.shtml and webindex.shtml files, because those changes
      will be overwritten by later steps.</p>

      <p>The JmriHelp_enTOC.xml and JmriHelp_enIndex.xml files are
      straight-forward XML, and you can manually edit them. Make
      sure to run the JHelpDev "create all" step and "ant" after
      doing so.</p>

      <p>You can also use the JHelpDev tool to add items to the
      table of contents and index if you'd like. There's more info
      on how to do that on the <a href=
      "http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev web site</a>.
      Remember to run "ant" after that to include your updates on
      the web versions. <a name="site" id="site"></a></p>

      <h2>Updating the JMRI.org site</h2>
      <p>Changes to Help pages
      which are checked-in should show up automatically on the
      JMRI.org site after a short while. There's a <a href=
      "http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/WebSite/job/generate-website/">
      Jenkins job</a> that handles periodic updates for the static
      (from repository, unlike e.g. Javadoc) pages.</p>
