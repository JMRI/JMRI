<h1>JMRI: Use of JavaHelp</h1>

This page talks about technical aspects of how JMRI provides help
information using 
<a href="https://javahelp.java.net">JavaHelp</a> and 
<a href="http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev</a>.


<h2>Organization of the help files</h2>

The help files are located in the "help" directory
within the JMRI distribution directory. 

<p>
The master copy of this is stored in our repository as the "help" 
directory in the JMRI code repository.
This means to get your own local copy, just follow the steps on the  
"<a href="getgitcode.shtml">getting the code</a>" page.

<p>
Within that, all the English-language files are located
within the "en" subdirectory.  Eventually, this will
let us internationalize the help pages.
<p>
Within that, there are several file trees:
<ul>
<li>package - organized like the source package tree,
this contains code-specific help files for e.g. a particular
window or component.  For example, a window that's created
by the <code>jmri.jmrit.speedometer.SpeedometerFrame</code> class
(from the <code>src/jmri/jmrit/speedometer/SpeedometerFrame.java</code> file)
should have its window-specific help in a file at
<code>package/jmri/jmrit/speedometer/SpeedometerFrame.shtml</code>.
<li>html - general descriptions, tutorials, etc.  
This in turn in organized into directories that represent general areas.
<li>manual - the most recent version of the DecoderPro et al manuals reformatted for 
use in the help system. (Older ones are stored in the
<a href="WebSite.shtml">main web site</a>)
</ul>

In the long run, we want only two branches to this structure:  the "package"
part of the tree for help information that is specific to 
a particular piece of code, 
and another part of the tree for more general information.
(It's a religious issue whether that 2nd part should be called
"html" or "manual"; the key thing is we end up with just one).
The web is meant to be a <em>web</em>, with many paths through
it to reach content.  The second part of the tree should also be organized
as "one page, one topic", with links to connect them as needed.

<a name="limitations">
<h3>Limitations of JavaHelp HTML</h3></a>

JavaHelp displays "plain old HTML 4.0", without providing some of the
syntactic sugar provided by many browsers to allow poor HTML to render.
In particular, there are a couple things to watch for.
<ul>
<li>Anchor tags need a specific format. 
Specifically, they should be written
<code><pre>
&lt;a name="pull" id="pull"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre></code>

For example, to put an anchor on a heading, do
<code><pre>
&lt;a name="foo" id="foo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foo!&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre></code>

<p>
Note: Incorrectly structured anchor tags (not like the above)
often cause just a
&lt; character appearing by itself on the rendered help page.

<li>Anchors also need to use the "name" attribute rather than
the "id" attribute.  See the item above for an example.

<li>You can't count on any particular location for your files
on the local machine, so all links to other help pages need to be relative.

<li>Links to web pages outside the help system work,
but JavaHelp can't display PDF files.  Links to those 
should be shown explicitly as links, so they can be copied to
an outside web browser.

</ul>

<a name="web" id="web"></a><h2>Web access to help</h2>

It's inconvenient to have to maintain two separate web pages for the
main web site and the help system.  To reduce the need for that, we
use a particular form for the web pages in the help system.
<ul>
<li>Use ".shtml" file extensions so that
the main web servers will search the files for
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html">server-side includes</a>.
<li>When you create a new page, start with a copy 
of either the 
help/en/TemplateBar.shtml or help/en/TemplatePlain.shtml
template 
file, depending on whether or not you want to include a "Sidebar"
via a file of the same name.  This will put the proper top and bottom
matter in place to get the page properly displayed.
</ul>

<a name="code" id="code"></a><h2>Access in the code</h2>

Within the JMRI code, access the help system comes
via the jmri.util.HelpUtil class.
(For historical reasons, there's a little bit of code
in apps.Apps, but you should ignore that).
<p>
The easiest way to add a help menu to a 
frame is to have it be a JmriJFrame (which you 
should do anyway), and call addHelpMenu(...)
after you've built any other menus.

<p>
By convention, we use a similar file tree for 
the source code and help files.  For example,
the <code>jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame</code>
class inherits from JmriJFrame, and adds a help menu with the line
<PRE>
<CODE>
  addHelpMenu("package.jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame", true);
</CODE>
</PRE>
The help file is then located at 
<code>help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/simpleclock/SimpleClockFrame.shtml</code>.
<p>
A number of help files have been put in place without any contents;
hopefully some users will edit them and contribute them back.

<a name="jhelpdev" id="jhelpdev"></a><h2>Creating the control files with JHelpDev</h2>

JavaHelp uses various XML files to 
control how the table of contents and index are displayed.
We create those with
<a href="http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev</a>.
Please don't edit them manually.  

<p>
JHelpDev is now included in the JMRI dist.  To use the tool:
<ol>
<li>Make sure you've updated to the most recent version in the code repository before getting started.</li>
<li>Start the tool by clicking on the jhelpdev.jar file. (If that doesn't work, try
running either JHelpDev.csh or JHelpDev.bat, depending on what kind of
computer you have)</li>

<li>Once the window appears, select "Open Project" under the "File" menu.</li>

<li>Navigate to the "help" directory in your checked out copy of the code, 
then the "en" directory within that, then select the "JHelpDev.xml" file 
and click "Open".</li>
<p> You may get a message about "[Fatal Error] index.html:1:3: The markup declarations contained or pointed to by the document type declaration must be well-formed."
Although it says it's fatal, it's really not a problem. Just ignore it. On startup the Map (a file containing the JHelpDev index of all anchors in the JMRI help system) is regenerated.

<li>By clicking the "Index Editor" tab or the "TOC Editor" tab, review and update the Help entries. A red line marks a hyperlink that JHelpDev can't locate on disk. Right-click on such a line to open the Edit context menu.</li>

<li>Click the "Create All" button to recreate the TOC, Index, etc.</li>

<li>Then, back on the command line and in the help/en directory, invoke
"ant" to create the web index and table of contents pages.  (Or if using 
Eclipse, right-click on the help/en/build.xml file and select Run As Ant Build.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The various control files that JavaHelp uses are stored in our code repository, 
so once you've done this they will show as modified.  
Please check them in when you check in new Help files so other 
people don't have to recreate those control files for themselves.

<a name="tocAndIndex" id="tocAndIndex"></a><h3>Table of Contents and Index</h3>

Java Help includes a 
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/webtoc.shtml">table of contents</a> and an 
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/webindex.shtml">index</a>. These are both available
as hyperlinks on the web, and provided via a nicer user interface when using
JavaHelp in the program.
<p>
The underlying information must be manually maintained in the 
help/en/JmriHelp_enTOC.xml and help/en/JmriHelp_enIndex.xml 
files, respectively.  JHelpDev then makes the files that Java Help needs, 
and an "ant" step in the directory makes the webtoc.shtml and webindex.shtml
files that are displayed on the web.
<p>
Note: This means you should not manually change the webToc.shtml and webindex.shtml files,
because those changes will be overwritten by later steps.
<p>
The JmriHelp_enTOC.xml and JmriHelp_enIndex.xml files are straight-forward
XML, and you can manually edit them.  Make sure to run the JHelpDev "create all" 
step and "ant" after doing so.
<p>
You can also use the JHelpDev tool to add items to the table of contents
and index if you'd like. 
There's more info on how to do that on the
<a href="http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev web site</a>. Remember to run 
"ant" after that to include your updates on the web versions.

<a name="site" id="site"></a><h2>Updating the JMRI.ORG site</h2>
Changes to Help pages which are checked-in should show up automatically on the JMRI.ORG
site after a short while. 
There's a 
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Web%20Site/job/Update%20Static%20Components/">Jenkins job</a>
that handles periodic updates for the static (from repository, unlike e.g. JavaDoc) pages.
