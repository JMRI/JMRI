     <p>This page talks about technical aspects of how JMRI provides help information
     using <a href="https://javahelp.java.net">JavaHelp</a> and <a href=
      "https://sourceforge.net/projects/jhelpdev/">JHelpDev</a> as well as some suggestions on

      <h2>Organization of the help Files</h2>

    <div class="para">

      The help files are
      located in the "help" directory within the JMRI distribution
      directory.

      <p>The master copy of this is stored in our repository as the
      "help" directory in the JMRI code repository. This means to
      get your own local copy, just follow the steps on the
      "<a href="getgitcode.shtml">getting the code</a>" page.</p>

      <p>Within that, all the English-language files are located
      within the "en" subdirectory. Eventually, this will let us
      internationalize the help pages.</p>

      <p>Within that, there are several file trees:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>package - organized like the source package tree, this
        contains code-specific help files for e.g. a particular
        window or component. For example, a window that's created
        by the <code>jmri.jmrit.speedometer.SpeedometerFrame</code>
        class (from the
        <code>src/jmri/jmrit/speedometer/SpeedometerFrame.java</code>
        file) should have its window-specific help in a file at
        <code>package/jmri/jmrit/speedometer/SpeedometerFrame.shtml</code>.</li>

        <li>html - general descriptions, tutorials, etc. This in
        turn in organized into directories that represent general
        areas.</li>

        <li>manual - the most recent version of the DecoderPro et
        al manuals reformatted for use in the help system. (Older
        ones are stored in the <a href="WebSite.shtml">main web
        site</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>While this is how we would LIKE our help files organized, help pages are created
      by members of the community and sometimes general descriptions are put in the package
      directory rather than the html directory and vice versa. [If you see something that
      needs to be moved, please post a note to the jmri-developers online groups.io forum
      as there are members who occassionally try to do some housekeeping.]</p>

      <p>In the long run, we want only two branches to the help file
      structure: the "package" part of the tree for help
      information that is specific to a particular piece of code,
      and another part of the tree for more general information.
      (It's a religious issue whether that 2nd part should be
      called "html" or "manual"; the key thing is we end up with
      just one). The web is meant to be a <em>web</em>, with many
      paths through it to reach content. The second part of the
      tree ("html") should also be organized as "one page, one topic", with
      links to connect them as needed.</p>

      <a name="web" id="web"></a>
      <h2>Web Access to Help Pages</h2>

    <div class="para">

      It is inconvenient to have to maintain two separate web pages for the main web site and the help
      system. To reduce the need for that, we use a particular form for the web pages in the help system.
      [Additional information can also be found <a href="WebSite.shtml">here.</a>]

      <ul>
        <li>Use ".shtml" file extensions so that the main web
        servers will search the files for <a href=
        "https://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html">server-side
        includes</a>.</li>

        <li>When you create a new page, start with a copy of either the help/en/TemplateBar.shtml
        or help/en/TemplatePlain.shtml template file, depending on whether or not you want to include
        a "sidebar" (via a file named Sidebar.shtml). This template will put the proper top and bottom
        matter in place to get the page properly displayed.
        </li>

        <li>In general, all help files in the html directory tree use a sidebar.  In general, files
         in the package part of the tree do not. If you are using a sidebar, you may find one that suits
         your purpose in the specific subdirectory in which you are working, in its parent directory, or,
         in rare cases, you can use the one in the html directory itself (either /help/en/html or /help/fr/html).

        <p> If none of these meet your needs (or do not exist), you may create a Sidebar.shtml in the subdirectory,
         in which case, you should follow the format of other Sidebar.shtml files in other subdirectories at the
         same level or in the parent directory. In 2020, there was a major effort to standardize the sidebar files,
         using server-side includes for common parts files in the <a href="../../../parts">
         /help/en/parts directory</a>. Typically a Sidebar.shtml file in a terminal subdirectory (one with no lower
         level) will further reference a "local part" in a file in the same subdirectory and named
         Sidebar[type]LocalPart.shtml, where [type] would be based on the name of the parent directory, such
         as Hardware or Tool. This use of local part files allows Sidebar.shtml files in terminal subdirectories
         to use identical code, something that makes maintenance significantly easier.</p>

        <p class="noted"> If you do not need a local part, you can include the Sidebar.shtml from the parent directory
         but ONLY if that file does not have any relative URLs (URLs with "../" and similar). It is does, the sidebar
         links will not work when incorporated into your page. Look at the contents of Sidebar.shtml in the parent
         directory before attempting to reference it.</p>
        </li>

        <li>All the page formatting on JMRI help and other web pages is done through included CSS
        files, originally created by John Plocher. These are included from "/css" via Server-Side
        Includes (SSI).  The main file is at <a href="../../../../../css/default.css">/css/default.css</a>
        and works with a few other files in that same directory. Because JavaHelp ignores SSI, the
        CSS formatting is ignored when JavaHelp is displaying the pages within the JMRI itself. In
        that case, JavaHelp provides the formatting.
        </li>

       </ul>

      <a name="limitations" id="limitations"></a>
      <h2>Standards for and Limitations of JavaHelp HTML</h2>

    <div class="para">

      JavaHelp displays "plain
      old HTML 4.0", without providing some of the syntactic sugar
      provided by many browsers to allow poor HTML to render.
      Do not include any particular formatting options, specifically
      including embedded CSS commands.
      There are a couple of specific things to watch for:

      <ul>
        <li>Anchor tags need a specific format. Specifically, they should be written
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
&lt;a name="pull" id="pull"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
          around text content only. It's OK to be empty between the open and close tags.
          It's not OK to combine them into a single <code>&lt;a name="pull"/&gt;</code>
          tag; don't do that, as it confuses JavaHelp.

          <p>For example, to put an anchor on a heading, do</p>
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="foo" id="foo"&gt;Foo!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>

          <p>Note: Incorrectly structured anchor tags (not like the
          above) often cause just a &lt; character appearing by
          itself on the rendered help page.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Anchors need to use the "name" attribute as well as the "id" attribute for future
        compatibility. Name is recognized by JavaHelp but not by the latest versions of html while id
        is not recognized by JavaHelp. See the item above for an example.</li>

        <li>Do not use spaces or <code>%20</code> in anchor names.
        If you must use a phrase for a name, use the underscore character:
        "This_Anchor", not "This Anchor.</li>

        <li>You can use the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element, or
        the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element, but you can't use
        both together. <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> is good for
        highlighting in-line text as being code (like we've used it
        here); <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> is good for making a block
        of inline HTML or Java look right. To give a code-like
        appearance to a block, wrap it in <code>&lt;pre
        style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;</code></li>

        <li>When describing a sequence of user actions or pulldowns, use the double right arrow to indicate
        sequence, HTML 4 tag ampersand-rArr-semicolon, and label the whole sequence as "strong":
        <br>
        <strong>File &rArr; Store Panels</strong>
        <br>
        A non-blanking space can be used before the right arrow to control line breaks.
        </li>

        <li>You cannot count on any particular location for your files on the local machine, so all links
        to other help pages need to be relative. Links to XML contents also need to be relative even though
        they are not displayed by JavaHelp.</li>

    <!--
        <li>DEBATABLE: Use fully qualitifed URLs for references to JavaDocs
        (e.g. https://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/managers/AbstractManager.html). These files are put in
        different places at different times during the development process so relative addresses may or may
        not work.</li>
     -->

        <li>Links to web pages outside the help system work and should be specified as fully qualified,
        preferably with https://. In most cases they will be automatically opened in an external web browser.
        [If you are already looking at the help page in an external browser, these pages may be opened in a
        new tab or in the same tab (overwriting the current page), depending on how the person who wrote the
        help page coded the reference. As of this writing (2020/04/04), there is an on-going debate as to the
        prefered method.]</li>

      <h2>Creating Help/Web Pages for New Hardware</h2>

    <div class="para">

      <p>When you integrate support for new hardware into JMRI, you should also create a page or pages for the
      help system and the web.  There are several steps involved to ensure that your new hardware help is integrated
      into the JMRI Help system and its web site. All references below to files are to the
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI"> JMRI Repository structure</a> in Github. Note use
      of capitalization in references to (fictitious) product "X" from manufacturer "M":</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Create the general help page or pages for the new hardware:
          <ul>
            <li>See <a href="../../hardware/index.shtml">other hardware help pages linked off the Hardware Index page</a>
            for examples before beginning.  There are a variety of styles based on how much information you want to provide.
            You can also provide a link to external manufacturer pages.</li>
            <li>Create your help page and put it into "/help/en/html/hardware", either directly as "X.shtml" if only a single
            file or in its own subdirectory "/help/en/html/hardware/m/" if there are going to be multiple pages.  You should
            name the first file "index.shtml" when in its own subdirectory.</li>
            <li>If your help pages have images, create a subdirectory "/help/en/html/hardware/m/images" to store them.</li>
            <li>Put in the standard sidebar by an "include" of "/help/en/html/hardware/Sidebar.shtml" (using
            appropriate relative addressing) in your help page or pages.  [Some creators of hardware and hardware families
            create their own "SidebarHardwareLocalPart.shtml" file in the "m" subdirectory to have custom information in the
            sidebar. This also requires creating a file "Sidebar.shtml" in "standard format" in the "m" subdirectory. See
            some exising hardware entries such as <a href="../../hardware/arduino/index.shtml">
            this one</a> for examples.]</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create any "code-specific" help page or pages for the new hardware:
          <ul>
            <li>As discussed in the first section of this page, "code-specific" help (i.e. related to a particular window or
            component) should be in pages in a different part of the file directory tree. Any pages you create to
            explain windows or code should be placed under "/help/en/package/" branch based on where the actual code is stored.</li>
            <li>Make sure you provide links to these pages in your general help pages.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create entries in the Hardware Index page:
          <ul>
            <li>Add a hardware listing entry and paragraph in <a href="../../hardware/index.shtml">
            "/help/en/html/hardware/index.shtml"</a> following the formats and categorization of other similar hardware.</li>
            <li>Add an entry for "M X" to the Category/Alphabetic Index in the appropriate place near the top of
            "hardware/index.shtml".</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create an entry in the Supported Hardware "sidebar part":
          <ul>
            <li>Add an entry in alphabetic order for "M X" to the hardware sidebar part "/help/en/parts/SidebarSupportedHardware.shtml".</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create Help TOC and Index entries:
          <ul>
            <li>Add an entry for "M X" under "Hardware Support" to the file "JMRIHelp_enTOC.xml" found in the /help/en/ directory. </li>
            <li>Add one or more entries for "M X" such as "X (M)" or other helpful index items to the file "JMRIHelp_enindex.xml"
            found in the /help/en/ directory.</li>
            <li>See the section below on <a href="#tocAndIndex">Help Table of Contents and Index</a> for additional steps to update
            the TOC and Index.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

        <p>Following all these steps will ensure that other users will be able to find and use the new hardware you have integrated
        into JMRI.</p>

      <h2>Checking Your Changes</h2>

    <div class="para">

      <p>The <a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml">Continuous Integration</a> process checks all
      changes to JMRI Help files to make sure they're OK.  If you'd like to run that same check
      while you're working, do:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    ant scanhelp
</pre>
      <p>If you do not have access to ant, you should use one of the HTML validation programs available
      online, such as from <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">the W3C Markup Validation
      Service.</a> These services will find many common errors (unmatched tags, etc.), but also sometimes
      give warning or even error messages that do not impact JMRI integration.</p>

      <a name="tocAndIndex" id= "tocAndIndex"></a>
      <h2>Help Table of Contents and Index</h2>

    <div class="para">

      Java Help includes a
      <a href="../../../webtoc.shtml">table of
      contents</a> and an <a href=
      "../../../webindex.shtml">index</a>. These are
      both available as hyperlinks on the web, and provided via a
      nicer user interface when using JavaHelp in the program.

      <p>The underlying information must be maintained manually in
      the help/en/JmriHelp_enTOC.xml and
      help/en/JmriHelp_enIndex.xml files, respectively. JHelpDev
      then makes the files that Java Help needs, and an "ant" step
      in the directory makes the webtoc.shtml and webindex.shtml
      files that are displayed on the web.</p>

      <p>Note: This means you should not manually change the
      webToc.shtml and webindex.shtml files, because those changes
      will be overwritten by later steps.</p>

      <p>The JmriHelp_enTOC.xml and JmriHelp_enIndex.xml files are
      straight-forward XML, and you can manually edit them. Make
      sure to run the JHelpDev "create all" step and "ant" after
      doing so.</p>

      <p>You can also use the JHelpDev tool to add items to the
      table of contents and index if you'd like. There's more info
      on how to do that on the <a href=
      "http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev web site</a>.
      Remember to run "ant" after that to include your updates on
      the web versions.</p>

      <h2>Creating the control files with JHelpDev</h2>

    <div class="para">

      JavaHelp
      uses various XML files to control how the table of contents
      and index are displayed. We create those with <a href=
      "http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev</a>. Please don't
      edit them manually.

      <p>JHelpDev is now included in the JMRI dist. To use the
      tool:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you've updated to the most recent version in
        the code repository before getting started.</li>

        <li>You can run in batch mode by running <code>ant</code>
        from the command line in the <code>help/en/</code>
        directory. It'll still pop windows, but should run
        to completion by itself.  It might take a minute or so.</li>

        <li>If you'd like to operate it manually, please
        follow the rest of these bullets.
        (Or if using Eclipse, right-click on the
        help/en/build.xml file and select Run As Ant Build.)</li>

        <li>Start the tool by clicking on the jhelpdev.jar file.
        (If that doesn't work, try running either JHelpDev.csh or
        JHelpDev.bat, depending on what kind of computer you
        have)</li>

        <li>Once the window appears, select "Open Project" under
        the "File" menu.</li>

        <li>Navigate to the "help" directory in your checked out
        copy of the code, then the "en" directory within that, then
        select the "JHelpDev.xml" file and click "Open".</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">
          <p>You may get a message about "[Fatal Error]
          index.html:1:3: The markup declarations contained or
          pointed to by the document type declaration must be
          well-formed." Although it says it's fatal, it's really
          not a problem. Just ignore it. On startup the Map (a file
          containing the JHelpDev index of all anchors in the JMRI
          help system) is regenerated.</p>
        </li>

        <li>By clicking the "Index Editor" tab or the "TOC Editor"
        tab, review and update the Help entries. A red line marks a
        hyperlink that JHelpDev can't locate on disk. Right-click
        on such a line to open the Edit context menu.</li>

        <li>Click the "Create All" button to recreate the TOC,
        Index, etc.</li>

        <li>Then, back on the command line and in the help/en
        directory, invoke "ant index TOC" to create the web index and table
        of contents pages. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>The various control files that JavaHelp uses are stored in
      our code repository, so once you've done this they will show
      as modified. Please check them in when you check in new Help

      <h2>Access To Help in the Code</h2>

    <div class="para">

      Within the JMRI code, access the
      help system comes via the jmri.util.HelpUtil class. (For
      historical reasons, there's a little bit of code in
      apps.Apps, but you should ignore that).

      <p>The easiest way to add a help menu to a frame is to have
      it be a JmriJFrame (which you should do anyway), and call
      addHelpMenu(...) after you've built any other menus.</p>

      <p>By convention, we use a similar file tree for the source
      code and help files. For example, the
      <code>jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame</code> class
      inherits from JmriJFrame, and adds a help menu with the
      line</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  addHelpMenu("package.jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame", true);
</pre>The help file is then located at
<code>help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/simpleclock/SimpleClockFrame.shtml</code>.
      <p>You should add the new page to the JHelpDev index to have JMRI
      accept it as a Help target (see next the heading).</p>
      <p>A number of help files have been put in place without any
      contents; hopefully some users will edit them and contribute
      them back.</p>

      <h2>Updating the JMRI.org Web Site</h2>

    <div class="para">

      <p>Changes to Help pages which are checked-in should show up automatically on the
      <a href="WebSite.shtml">JMRI.org web site </a>after a short while. There's a <a href=
      "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/WebSite/job/generate-website/">
      Jenkins job</a> that handles periodic updates for the static
      (from repository, unlike e.g. Javadoc) pages.</p>
