    <h1 id="helpTop">JMRI Code: Creating Help Pages and Using JmriHelp</h1>

      <div>

        <p>This page talks about technical aspects of how JMRI provides help information
        using <strong>JmriHelp</strong> as well as some suggestions on common approaches
        for help pages.</p>

        <p><strong>JmriHelp</strong> replaces <strong>JavaHelp</strong>.  The main
        difference is that the help pages are displayed in the user's default browser.
        This removes the HTML 4 requirement along with the requirement for the <strong>
        name</strong> attribute in anchor tags.  Links within a page now use the <strong>id
        </strong> attribute which can be placed in any HTML tag, such as the header tags.
        <strong>Preferences &rArr; Help</strong> is used by the user to select the whether
        <strong>Window Help</strong> and <strong>General help</strong> references are
        displayed using the distribution help files or <strong>jmri.org</strong> help files.
        The later provides fully formatted help pages.

      <p>Note: The following content has references to directory paths.  The language specific
      portion of the path is displayed as <strong>**</strong>.  The current language values
      are <strong>en</strong> for English and <strong>fr</strong> for French.</p>

      <p>Since the goal is to update the JMRI repository, the following actions need to
      take place within a <strong>git branch</strong> for the task, <strong>not</strong>
      the master branch.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Organization of the <strong>help</strong> files</h2>

      <div>

      <p>The help files are located in the <strong>help</strong> directory within the JMRI
      distribution directory.</p>

      <p>The master copy is stored in the <strong>help</strong> directory in the
      JMRI code repository. This means to get your own local copy, follow the steps on the
      "<a href="getgitcode.shtml">getting the code</a>" page.</p>

      <p>Within that, all the English-language files are located within the <strong>en</strong>
      subdirectory. Eventually, this will let us internationalize the help pages.</p>

      <p>Within that, there are several file trees:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>package</strong> - organized like the source package tree, this
        contains code-specific help files for e.g. a particular window or component. For
        example, a window that's created by the <code>jmri.jmrit.speedometer.SpeedometerFrame</code>
        class (from the <code>src/jmri/jmrit/speedometer/SpeedometerFrame.java</code>
        file) should have its window-specific help in a file at
        <code>package/jmri/jmrit/speedometer/SpeedometerFrame.shtml</code>.</li>

        <li><strong>html</strong> - general descriptions, tutorials, etc. This in
        turn in organized into directories that represent general
        areas.</li>

        <li><strong>manual</strong> - the most recent version of the DecoderPro et
        al manuals reformatted for use in the help system. (Older
        ones are stored in the <a href="WebSite.shtml">main web
        site</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>While this is how we would LIKE our help files organized, help pages are created
      by members of the community and sometimes general descriptions are put in the package
      directory rather than the html directory and vice versa. [If you see something that
      needs to be moved, please post a note to the jmri-developers online groups.io forum
      as there are members who occassionally try to do some housekeeping.]</p>

      <p>In the long run, we want only two branches to the help file structure: the
      <strong>package</strong> part of the tree for help information that is specific to
      a particular piece of code, and another part of the tree for more general information.
      (It's a religious issue whether that 2nd part should be called "html" or "manual";
      the key thing is we end up with just one). The web is meant to be a <em>web</em>,
      with many paths through it to reach content. The second part of the tree ("html")
      should also be organized as "one page, one topic", with links to connect them as needed.</p>

             <p><a href="#helpTop">[Go to top of page]</a></p>

      </div>

<!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->
      <h2 id="web">Web Access to Help Pages</h2>

      <div>

      <p>It is inconvenient to have to maintain two separate web pages for the main web
      site and the help system. To reduce the need for that, we use a particular form for
      the web pages in the help system. [Additional information can also be found
      <a href="WebSite.shtml">here.</a>]</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Use ".shtml" file extensions so that the main web server will search the files
        for <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html">server-side
        includes</a>.</li>

        <li>When you create a new page, start with a copy of either the
        <strong>help/en/template-sidebar.shtml</strong> or <strong>help/en/template-no-sidebar.shtml</strong>
        template file, depending on whether or not you want to include a "sidebar" (via a
        file named Sidebar.shtml). This template will put the proper top and bottom
        content in place to get the page properly displayed.</li>

        <li>In general, all help files in the <strong>html</strong> directory tree use a
        sidebar while files in the <strong>package</strong> part of the tree do not. If
        you are using a sidebar, you may find one that suits your purpose in the specific
        subdirectory in which you are working, in its parent directory, or, in rare cases,
        you can use the one in the <strong>html</strong> directory itself.

          <p> If none of these meet your needs (or do not exist), you may create a
          <strong>Sidebar.shtml</strong> in the subdirectory, in which case, you should
          follow the format of other Sidebar.shtml files in other subdirectories at the
          same level or in the parent directory. In 2020, there was a major effort to
          standardize the sidebar files, using server-side includes for common parts files
          in the <a href="../../../parts">/help/en/parts directory</a>.

          Typically a
          Sidebar.shtml file in a terminal subdirectory (one with no lower level) will
          further reference a <strong>local part</strong> in a file in the same subdirectory
          and named <strong>Sidebar[type]LocalPart.shtml</strong>, where [type] would be
          based on the name of the parent directory, such as Hardware or Tool. This use of
          local part files allows Sidebar.shtml files in terminal subdirectories to use
          identical code, something that makes maintenance significantly easier.</p>

          <p class="noted"> If you do not need a local part, you can include the Sidebar.shtml
          from the parent directory but ONLY if that file does not have any relative URLs
          (URLs with "../" and similar). If it is does, the sidebar links will not work
          when incorporated into your page. Look at the contents of Sidebar.shtml in the
          parent directory before attempting to reference it.</p>
        </li>

        <li>All the page formatting on JMRI help and other web pages is done through
        included CSS files, originally created by John Plocher. These are included from
        "/css" via Server-Side Includes (SSI).  The main file is at
        <a href="../../../../../css/default.css">/css/default.css</a> and works with a few
        other files in that same directory. Because JmriHelp ignores SSI, the CSS formatting
        is ignored when JmriHelp is displaying the pages. In that case, JmriHelp and the
        browser's default CSS provide the formatting.
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p>Note:  The French web pages have not been updated to the new sidebar structure.</p>

      <p><a href="#helpTop">[Go to top of page]</a></p>

      </div>

<!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->
      <h2 id="standards">Standards for JmriHelp HTML</h2>

      <div>

      <p>JmriHelp uses standard HTML 5.  Since the SSI includes look like comments, they
      are not processed.  The help pages will be displayed using the browser's default CSS.
      If additional CSS is added to the help page, it will override the browser settings.
      It will also override the site CSS settings when the page is displayed by the site
      server.</p>

      <p>The file name cannot contain an underscore character.  The file suffix is .shtml.</p>

      <p>The <strong>id</strong> attribute can assigned to HTML tags and then referenced by
      JmriHelp.  This makes it possible to display window specific help information within
      a larger help document.</p>

      <p>Do not use spaces or <code>%20</code> in id names.  If you must use a phrase for
      a name, use the underscore character:  "This_Anchor", not "This Anchor.</p>

      <p>When describing a sequence of user actions or pulldowns, use the double right
      arrow HTML entity <strong>ampersand-rArr-semicolon</strong>, and label the whole
      sequence as "strong".  For example:
      <br>
      <strong>File &rArr; Store Panels</strong>
      <br>
      A non-blanking space can be used before the right arrow to control line breaks.
      </p>

      <p>You cannot count on any particular location for your files on the local machine,
      so all links to other help pages need to be relative. Links to XML contents also
      need to be relative even though they are not displayed by JmriHelp.</p>

      <p>Links to web pages outside the help system work and should be specified as fully
      qualified, preferably with https://. These pages may be opened in a new tab or in
      the same tab (overwriting the current page), depending on how the person who wrote
      the help page coded the reference. As of this writing (2020/04/04), there is an
      on-going debate as to the prefered method.]  The browser preferences might also
      affect the new tab / replace tab behavior.</p>

      <h2 id="code">Access To Help in the Code</h2>

      <div>

        <p>Within the JMRI code, access to the help system comes via the <strong>
        jmri.util.HelpUtil</strong> class.  (For historical reasons, there's a little bit
        of code in apps.Apps, but you should ignore that).</p>

        <p>The easiest way to add a help menu to a frame is to have it be a JmriJFrame (which
        you should do anyway), and call addHelpMenu(<strong><em>&lt;helpkey&gt;</em></strong>)
        after you've built any other menus.</p>

        <p>The <strong>helpkey</strong> is the dotted path to the help file, <em>without the
        .shtml suffix</em>.  If the helpkey refers to an <strong>id</strong> within the page,
        the path is extended with an underscore and the name of the id.</p>

        <p>By convention, we use a similar file tree for the source code and help files. For
        example, the <code>jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame</code> class inherits
        from JmriJFrame, and adds a help menu with the
        line</p>

        <pre style="font-family: monospace;">addHelpMenu("package.jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame", true);
        </pre>The help file is then located at <code>help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/simpleclock/SimpleClockFrame.shtml</code>.

        <p>You should add the new page to the JmriHelp index to have JMRI accept it as a Help
        target (see the next heading).</p>

        <p>A number of help files have been put in place without any contents; hopefully
        some users will edit them and contribute them back.</p>

        <p><a href="#helpTop">[Go to top of page]</a></p>

      </div>

<!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->
      <h2 id="buildhelp">Configure JmriHelp</h2>

      <div>

        <p><strong>HelpUtil</strong> is called when the <strong>Window Help</strong> or
        <strong>General Help</strong> menu items are selected.  The <strong>helpkey</strong>
        specified in the JMRI code is used to display the appropriate help page in the browser.</p>

        <p>Using <strong>Preferences &rArr; Help</strong>, the user can choose to have the
        local help page or the <em>jmri.org</em> help page displayed.  The local page is
        in the JMRI distribution which means the page is at the same release level as the
        JMRI code.</p>

        <p>If jmri.org is selected, HelpUtil will convert the helpkey into a URL and pass
        it to the user's default browser.</p>

        <h3>Creating the JmriHelp files</h3>

          <p>When a new <strong>helpkey</strong> has been defined in the JMRI code, it
          needs to be added to the index and/or the table contents.  These files are used
          to build the necessary content to link the helpkey to the local help page.</p>

          <h4>Update JmriHelp_**Index.xml and/or JmriHelp_**TOC.xml</h4>

            <p>These files reside at <strong>help/**</strong> (** is <strong>en</strong>
            for English or <strong>fr</strong> for French).</p>

            <p>These are xml files that can edited with any xml aware file editor.  Each
            line in the file consists of a user friendly <strong>text</strong> name and the <strong>target</strong> helpkey.</p>

            <code>
              &lt;indexitem text="Setting The Internal Clock " target="package.jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame"/&gt;<br>
              &lt;tocitem text="Setting the Internal Clock " target="package.jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame"/&gt;
            </code>

          <h4>Run buildhelp</h4>

            <p>The JmriHelp configuration files are located at help/**/local.  This
            directory contains the following content:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>index.html</strong> -- This is the web page loaded by the local
              browser when <strong>Help &rArr; Window Help</strong> or <strong>Help &rArr;
              General Help </strong> is invoked by JMRI.  The page contains the table of
              contents in the left column and the selected help page in an iframe on the
              right.</li>

              <li><strong>jmri_map.xml</strong> -- This file contains the helpkeys and the
              actual URL for the help pag from the JmriHelp_**TOC.xml and JmriHelp_**Index.xml
              files along with other helpkeys that were not included in either the table
              of contents or index.</li>

              <li><strong>alternate_map.txt</strong> -- This contains a list of
              non-standard helpkeys and the target help page.</li>

              <li><strong>stub_template.html</strong> -- This file is used to build the
              stub files in the stub diretory.</li>

              <li><strong>stub</strong> -- This directory contains the stub files which
              are used to link a JMRI helpkey to the index.html.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Java process to pass a file name to a browser does not support query
            (?) or id (#) parameters.  The build process creates a stub file for each
            entry in jmri_map.xml.  The file name is <strong>&lt;helpkey&gt;.html</strong>.
            The stub file does a re-direct to <strong>local/index.html#helpkey</strong>.
            The javascript in index.html converts the helpkey into the file name to be
            loaded into the iframe.</p>

            <p>After JmriHelp_**TOC.xml and JmriHelp_**Index.xml have been updated, run
            the ant <strong>buildhelp</strong> target.  This is run using the main JMRI ant
            build.xml file, not the special build.xml in help/**.</p>

            <p>After the build process has completed, test the new helpkeys and verify
            that they open the proper pages.</p>

          <h4>Update the JMRI Repository</h4>

          <p>When the changes have been verified, commit the changes and create a pull
          request.  For details, see <a href="gitdeveloper.shtml">Developing with JMRI</a></p>

      <div>

      <p>JmriHelp includes a <a href="../../../webtoc.shtml">table of contents</a> and an

<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    ant scanhelp
</pre>
      <p>If you do not have access to ant, you should use one of the HTML validation programs available
      online, such as from <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">the W3C Markup Validation
      Service.</a> These services will find many common errors (unmatched tags, etc.), but also sometimes
      give warning or even error messages that do not impact JMRI integration.</p>

      <h2>Creating Help/Web Pages for New Hardware</h2>

      <div>

      <p>When you integrate support for new hardware into JMRI, you should also create a page or pages for the
      help system and the web.  There are several steps involved to ensure that your new hardware help is integrated
      into the JMRI Help system and its web site. All references below to files are to the
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI"> JMRI Repository structure</a> in Github. Note use
      of capitalization in references to (fictitious) product "X" from manufacturer "M":</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Create the general help page or pages for the new hardware:
          <ul>
            <li>See <a href="../../hardware/index.shtml">other hardware help pages linked off the Hardware Index page</a>
            for examples before beginning.  There are a variety of styles based on how much information you want to provide.
            You can also provide a link to external manufacturer pages.</li>
            <li>Create your help page and put it into "/help/en/html/hardware", either directly as "X.shtml" if only a single
            file or in its own subdirectory "/help/en/html/hardware/m/" if there are going to be multiple pages.  You should
            name the first file "index.shtml" when in its own subdirectory.</li>
            <li>If your help pages have images, create a subdirectory "/help/en/html/hardware/m/images" to store them.</li>
            <li>Put in the standard sidebar by an "include" of "/help/en/html/hardware/Sidebar.shtml" (using
            appropriate relative addressing) in your help page or pages.  [Some creators of hardware and hardware families
            create their own "SidebarHardwareLocalPart.shtml" file in the "m" subdirectory to have custom information in the
            sidebar. This also requires creating a file "Sidebar.shtml" in "standard format" in the "m" subdirectory. See
            some exising hardware entries such as <a href="../../hardware/arduino/index.shtml">
            this one</a> for examples.]</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create any "code-specific" help page or pages for the new hardware:
          <ul>
            <li>As discussed in the first section of this page, "code-specific" help (i.e. related to a particular window or
            component) should be in pages in a different part of the file directory tree. Any pages you create to

            <li>Add a hardware listing entry and paragraph in <a href="../../hardware/index.shtml">
            "/help/en/html/hardware/index.shtml"</a> following the formats and categorization of other similar hardware.</li>
            <li>Add an entry for "M X" to the Category/Alphabetic Index in the appropriate place near the top of
            "hardware/index.shtml".</li>

      <h2 id="technical">JmriHelp Build Process</h2>

      <div>

        <p>The main component is <strong>java/test/jmri/util/BuildHelpFilesTest</strong>.
        The class is nominally a test program, but it has a <code>public static main()</code>
        which makes it possible to be called from ant.  It is excluded from <strong>alltest
        </strong>.</p>

        <p>The program uses the <strong>JmriHelp_**</strong> files, the <strong>alternate_map.txt
        </strong> file and scans of the help tree to create the <strong>jmri_map.xml</strong>
        file and the stub files.</p>

        <p>When the program is done, the <strong>buildhelp</strong> target calls <strong>
        ant</strong> in each language location.  The language specific ant process builds
        the <strong>webtoc.shtml</strong> and <strong>webindex.shtml</strong> files from
        JmriHelp_**TOC.xml, JmriHelp_**Index.xml and jmri_map.xml using <strong>format.xsl
        </strong>.  The third step builds the <strong>local/index.html</strong> file using
        the <strong>JmriHelp_**TOC.xml</strong> and <strong>jmri_map.xml</strong> files
        using <strong>formatLocalTOC.xsl</strong>.</p>
