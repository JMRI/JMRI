    <h1>JMRI: Technology Road Map</h1>
      This page is the road map
      for JMRI's future develpoment, including changes to our use
      of Java technologies. It is maintained and updated through
      continuing discussion on the <a href=
      "https://jmri-developers.groups.io/g/jmri/topics">
      jmri-developers mailing list</a>.

      <p>There's also a <a href="TechRoadMapOlder.shtml">page
      containing the history</a>, particularly the saga of how we
      moved forward to Java 1.6 and Java 8 across a series of
      platform-related changes.</p>

      <h2>JMRI Releases</h2>This section describes the (notional)
      plans for JMRI releases in the future.

      <h4>JMRI in the Near Future</h4>The 4.1.* series of test
      releases in Fall 2015 started the requirement for Java 8,
      also known as Java 8.
      This has continued through the following release series.
      The December 2018 release, notionally JMRI 4.14 will
      remain with Java 8, but may involve other library updates.
      This includes doing development, test and production release
      builds using Java 1.8.0_181. (We also 
      <a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/VersionChecks/job/JRE%208u151/">test on Jenkins with Java 1.8_0_151</a>
      to ensure Windows XP compatibility)
      
      <p>The current long-term-support Java release is
      Java 11 from Fall of 2018.  
      Oracle has
      <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/a-quick-summary-on-the-new-java-se-subscription">aligned their Java and the OpenJDK from that point</a>.
      Because some people will
      need to have that on their computers for other purposes, 
      we ensure JMRI can build and run on Oracle Java 8 through 11
      and OpenJDK version 11
      by using 
      <a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/VersionChecks/">Jenkins</a>
      to 
      <ul>
      <li>Build and run AllTest on each of the JDKs for Java 9, 10, 11; and
      <li>Run allTest from each of those JDK 9, 10 and 11 builds on a Java 8u181 JRE; and
      <li>Run AllTest from our JDK 8 builds on each of the Java 9, 10 and 11 JREs.
      </ul>
      You can follow the current status of these on the
      <a href="CI-status.shtml">CI Status page</a>.
      
      <p>
      At some point, the Java version required by JMRI has to move forward.
      For example, Oracle 
      <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javaclientroadmapupdate2018mar-4414431.pdf">has announced</a> that they'll stop providing standalone JRE installers 
      by the end of 2020, by which time JMRI distributions will have to contain
      the Java runtime components or it won't be possible to run JMRI on newly-bought PCs. 
      That in turn might require tools like
      jlink from Java 9 or later.

      <p>
      While we don't know yet when JMRI will have to move past Java 8, 
      we do know that the earliest Java 9 or later will be required for users is Fall 2020.
      Allowing for migration and
      development time, and depending on development plans, JMRI's December 2020 release
      might require Java 11 (in which case it would be called JMRI 5.1)
      or stay with requiring Java 8 or later (in which case it would be called JMRI 4.20).
      Releases before Fall 202 are intended to stay fully compatible Java 8.
      
      <p>
      It's possible that, as an intermediate step,
      JMRI development will move to a later Java SDK version
      without requiring that JMRI users move to a later Java JRE version.  
      For example, it's remotely possible that JMRI will require a Java 11 SDK
      to compile and build distributions, which would still be able to
      work on Java 8.  We prefer to do that to keep older hardware working,
      but it's not always possible. 
      (Note:  Here, we're talking about using the Java 11 SDK, not about
      using Java 11 language features. Java 9 through 11 SDKs 
      require setting their source version and runtime version to the same
      value;  you can't compile i.e. Java 11 source code for a Java 8 runtime)

      <p>
      There are also smaller migration issues. These don't directly
      affect JMRI users in the way that Java version changes do, but 
      they may effect external users of the JMRI libraries.
      
      <ul>
        <li>At some point, we have to migrate away from <a href=
        "Help.shtml">JavaHelp and JHelpDev</a>. At a minimum, we'll
        need to <a href=
        "http://weblogs.java.net/blog/brinkley/archive/2004/11/javahelp_v20_02.html">
        replace the renderer</a>. There are <a href=
        "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9900110/javahelp-viewers-or-alternatives">
        several alternative help systems</a> available. <a href=
        "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/index-083946.html">
        Oracle Help</a> might be a good choice. DocBook as a tool
        for generating multiple documentation forms is also being
        considered.</li>

        <li>Our use of JUnit has been partially migrated to the 
        <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit 4 release</a>, 
        currently 4.12.
        Among other improvements, this can allow use of the Java
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3806173/assert-keyword-in-java">assert keyword</a>. 
        We're working on how best to use the
        new capabilities, see the <a href="JUnit.shtml#junit4">JMRI
        JUnit page</a>. At some point, perhaps in 2019, we'll want to migrate to
        <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit 5</a> to get access to 
        <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2017/top-five-reasons-to-use-junit-5-java/">new testing tools</a>,
        particularly for parameterized tests.
        We also need to complete the conversion from JFCUnit to Jemmy for
        Swing testing.</li>

        <li>USB access technology has advanced a lot since support
        for some basic libraries was added to JMRI. At some point,
        we should replace those early library versions, but it will
        break some user scripts.</li>

        <li>Our <a href="Logging.shtml">logging methodology</a> is
        now a hybrid of native logging (in some included
        libraries), Log4J (our original solution) and SLF4J (the
        most recent addition). It's likely that we'll eventually
        simplify that.</li>

      </ul>

      information on Java releases and the operating systems that
      support them is on a <a href="JVMCapabilities.shtml">separate

      <h2>Migration Notes</h2>This is a section of notes for
      various code migrations that are in progress or contemplated.

      <a id="junit4" name="junit4"></a><h3>From JUnit 3 to JUnit 4</h3>
      JMRI's
      <a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml">continuous integration</a>
      test suites and infrastructure are migrating from
      JUnit 3 to JUnit 4.  For more information, see the
      section on
