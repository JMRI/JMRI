<H1>JMRI: Technology Road Map</H1>

This page is the road map for JMRI's future develpoment, 
including changes to our use of 
Java technologies.  It is maintained and updated through
continuing discussion on the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=jmri-developers">jmri-developers mailing list</a>.

<p>
There's also a
<a href="TechRoadMapOlder.shtml">page containing the history</a>, particularly the saga of how we moved 
forward to Java 1.6 across a series of platform-related changes.

<h2>JMRI Releases</h2>

This section describes the (notional)
plans for JMRI releases in the future.
<P>
Note that there's been no decision on when a "4.0" version is warranted, so these are described as 3.* numbers.
In the past, we went from 2.13 (test) to 2.14 (production) to 2.99 (test) to 3.0 (production), so that numbering
system might be used again.

<p>

<h4>JMRI 3.9, 3.10</h4>

The JMRI 3.9 development series is planned to stay with Java 1.6 for JRE and SDK. Contemplated changes:

<ul>
<LI>
</UL>

<h4>JMRI 3.11, 3.12</h4>

The JMRI 3.11 development series are not
final. 
The JRE and JDK choice for JMRI 3.11 development 
will depend on desired runtime features, and availability on 
our popular user and development platforms. It is 
<u>tentatively</u>
Java 1.7 for both building and running.
It might also be 1.6 JRE, 1.7 SDK.

<p>
New Java and library features
(subject to verification):

<UL>
<LI>
</UL>



<h4>JMRI after Summer 2015</h4>



<h3>Java Release and Operating System Support</h3>

More information on Java releases and the operating systems
that support them is on a 
<a href="JVMCapabilities.shtml">separate page</a>.

<P>

<h3>Remaining Issues</h3>

<p>There's some interest in moving to Java 1.7 to get access to:
<ul>
<li>
<li>
</ul>
