      <h1>JMRI: Technology Road Map</h1>
      This page is the road map
      for JMRI's future develpoment, including changes to our use
      of Java technologies. It is maintained and updated through
      continuing discussion on the <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=jmri-developers">
      jmri-developers mailing list</a>.

      <p>There's also a <a href="TechRoadMapOlder.shtml">page
      containing the history</a>, particularly the saga of how we
      moved forward to Java 1.6 and Java 1.8 across a series of
      platform-related changes.</p>

      <h2>JMRI Releases</h2>This section describes the (notional)
      plans for JMRI releases in the future.

      <h4>JMRI during and after 2016</h4>The 4.1.* series of test
      releases in Fall 2015 started the requirement for Java 8,
      also known as Java 1.8.
      This has continued through the following release series.
      The December 2017 release, notionally JMRI 4.10 will
      remain with Java 8, but may involve other updates.

      <ul>
        <li>At some point, we have to migrate away from <a href=
        "Help.shtml">JavaHelp and JHelpDev</a>. At a minimum, we'll
        need to <a href=
        "http://weblogs.java.net/blog/brinkley/archive/2004/11/javahelp_v20_02.html">
        replace the renderer</a>. There are <a href=
        "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9900110/javahelp-viewers-or-alternatives">
        several alternative help systems</a> available. <a href=
        "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/index-083946.html">
        Oracle Help</a> might be a good choice. DocBook as a tool
        for generating multiple documentation forms is also being
        considered.</li>

        <li>Our use of JUnit has been migrated to the current <a href=
        "http://junit.org">JUnit 4 release</a>, currently 4.12.
        Among other improvements, this can allow use of the Java
        <a href=
        "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3806173/assert-keyword-in-java">
        assert keyword</a>. We're working on how best to use the
        new capabilities, see the <a href="JUnit.shtml#junit4">JMRI
        JUnit page</a>.</li>

        <li>USB access technology has advanced a lot since support
        for some basic libraries was added to JMRI. At some point,
        we should replace those early library versions, but it will
        break some user scripts.</li>

        <li>Our <a href="Logging.shtml">logging methodology</a> is
        now a hybrid of native logging (in some included
        libraries), Log4J (our original solution) and SLF4J (the
        most recent addition). It's likely that we'll eventually
        simplify that.</li>

        <li>JMRI 4.7.5 migrated from RXTX to PureJavaComm (PJC);
        there may be follow-on work from that.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Java Release and Operating System Support</h3>More
      information on Java releases and the operating systems that
      support them is on a <a href="JVMCapabilities.shtml">separate
      page</a>.

      <h2>Migration Notes</h2>This is a section of notes for
      various code migrations that are in progress or contemplated.
      See also the related section on the <a href=
      "JVMCapabilities.shtml">migration to Java 1.8</a>.

      <a id="junit4" name="junit4"></a><h3>From JUnit 3 to JUnit 4</h3>
      JMRI's
      <a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml">continuous integration</a>
      test suites and infrastructure are migrating from
      JUnit 3 to JUnit 4.  For more information, see the
      section on
      <a href="JUnit.shtml#junit4">our JUnit page</a>.

      <a id="jdom2" name="jdom2"></a><h3>From JDOM 1 to JDOM 2</h3>JMRI
      3.11 moved from JDOM version 1 to JDOM version 2. This
      involved a new jdom-2.0.5.jar file (in place of the earlier
      jdom.jar), changes to startup and build control files, and
      some required code changes:

      <ul>
        <li>JDOM 2 classes are in the org.jdom2 package instead of
        org.jdom. This required some changes to import statements
        and class-references in the source code.</li>

        <li>The default output formatting is different, requiring
        minor changes in e.g. the XmlFile class output
        routines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, JDOM 2 uses generics in its input
      parameters and return values. This means you can remove (now
      redundant) casts in many places. Jenkins will warn about
      those.</p>
