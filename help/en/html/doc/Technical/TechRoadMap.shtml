      <h1>JMRI: Technology Road Map</h1>
      This page is the road map for JMRI's future development, including changes to our use of Java
      technologies. It is maintained and updated through continuing discussion on the <a href=
      "https://jmri-developers.groups.io/g/jmri/topics">jmri-developers mailing list</a>.
      <p>There's also a <a href="TechRoadMapOlder.shtml">page containing the history</a>,
      particularly the saga of how we moved forward to Java 1.6 and Java 8 across a series of
      platform-related changes.</p>

      <h2>JMRI Releases</h2>

      <p>This section describes the (notional) plans for JMRI releases in the future.</p>

      <h3>Java and JMRI in the Near Future</h3>
      The 4.1.* series of test releases in Fall 2015 started the requirement for Java 8. This has
      continued through the following release series. Java 8 will continue to be the requirement
      through the Fall of 2021. This involves doing development, test and production release
      builds using Java 1.8.0_181. (We also <a href=
      "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/VersionChecks/job/JRE%208u151/">test on
      Jenkins with Java 1.8_0_151</a> to ensure Windows XP compatibility)
      <p>The next long-term-support (LTS) Java release is Java 11 from Fall of 2018. Oracle has
      <a href=
      "https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/a-quick-summary-on-the-new-java-se-subscription">
      aligned their Java and the OpenJDK from that point</a>. Because some people will need to have
      that on their computers for other purposes, we have been building and running JMRI
      for testing purposes on Oracle Java 8
      through 11 and OpenJDK version 11 by using <a href=
      "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/VersionChecks/">Jenkins</a>.
      You can follow the current status of these on the <a href="CI-status.shtml">CI Status
      page</a>.
      <p>Java 17 is the current LTS release.  JMRI is built and tests are run on it too,
      but we don't recommend using it due to some remaining compatibility issues.

      <p>In the near future, the Java version required by JMRI will move forward. We expect
      that it will be during the Spring 2022 development releases, leading to the June 2022
      production releases requiring Java 11 and therefore being called JMRI 5.0. There might be one
      or two JMRI updates and minor releases early in Spring that would still work with Java 8.</p>

      <h4>Java Release and Operating System Support</h4>
      More information on Java releases and the operating systems that support them is on a
      <a href="JVMCapabilities.shtml">separate page</a>.

      <h2>Migration Notes</h2>

      <p>This is a section of notes for various code migrations that are in progress or
      contemplated. These don't directly affect JMRI users in the way that Java version changes do,
      but they may effect external users of the JMRI libraries.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>USB access technology has advanced a lot since support for some basic libraries was
        added to JMRI. At some point, we should replace those early library versions, but it will
        break some user scripts.</li>

        <li>Our <a href="Logging.shtml">logging methodology</a> is now a hybrid of native logging
        (in some included libraries), Log4J 1.2.17 (our logger) and SLF4J (a logging abstraction
        layer). We may choose to simplify that, but at least we have to move to another logger at
        some point.
