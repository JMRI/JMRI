<H1>JMRI: Technology Road Map</H1>

This page is the road map for JMRI's future develpoment, 
including changes to our use of 
Java technologies.  It is maintained and updated through
continuing discussion on the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=jmri-developers">jmri-developers mailing list</a>.

<p>
There's also a
<a href="TechRoadMapOlder.shtml">page containing the history</a>, particularly the saga of how we moved 
forward to Java 1.6 and Java 1.8 across a series of platform-related changes.

<h2>JMRI Releases</h2>

This section describes the (notional)
plans for JMRI releases in the future.
<!--<P>
Note that there's been no decision on when a "4.0" version is warranted, so these are described as 3.* numbers.
In the past, we went from 2.13 (test) to 2.14 (production) to 2.99 (test) to 3.0 (production), so that numbering
system might be used again.-->

<h4>JMRI during and after 2016</h4>

The 4.1.* series of test releases in Fall 2015 continued with Java 1.8
and the same set of included libraries.  
The following 4.3.* series, in Spring 2016, will continue with Java 1.8, but may
involve other updates.

<ul>

<li>The library for the included <a href="../../web/WebServer.shtml">Jetty web server</a> will be updated to version 9.3.6.

<li>At some point, we have to migrate away from <a href="Help.shtml">JavaHelp and JHelpDev</a>.
At a minimum, we'll need to
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/brinkley/archive/2004/11/javahelp_v20_02.html">replace the renderer</a>.
There are 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9900110/javahelp-viewers-or-alternatives">several alternative help systems</a> available.
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/index-083946.html">Oracle Help</a>
might be a good choice. DocBook as a tool for generating multiple documentation forms is also being considered.

<li>At some point, we have to update JUnit to the current <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit 4 release</a>, currently 4.12.
Among other improvements, this will allow use of the 
Java <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3806173/assert-keyword-in-java">assert keyword</a>. We'll
need to establish some conventions for how to use that.

<li>USB access technology has advanced a lot since support for some basic libraries was added to 
JMRI.  At some point, we should replace those early library versions, but it will break some user scripts.

<li>Our <a href="Logging.shtml">logging methodology</a> is now a hybrid of native logging (in some included libraries), 
Log4J (our original solution) and SLF4J (the most recent addition). It's likely that we'll eventually simplify that.

</ul>

<h3>Java Release and Operating System Support</h3>

More information on Java releases and the operating systems
that support them is on a 
<a href="JVMCapabilities.shtml">separate page</a>.

<P>

<h2>Migration Notes</h2>

This is a section of notes for various code migrations that are in progress
or contemplated. See also the related section on the 
<a href="JVMCapabilities.shtml ">migration to Java 1.8</a>.

<h3 id="jdom2" name="jdom2">From JDOM 1 to JDOM 2</h3>

JMRI 3.11 moved from JDOM version 1 to JDOM version 2.  This involved
a new jdom-2.0.5.jar file (in place of the earlier jdom.jar), changes to 
startup and build control files, and some required code changes:
<ul>
<li>JDOM 2 classes are in the org.jdom2 package instead of org.jdom.  This 
required some changes to import statements and class-references in the source code.
<li>The default output formatting is different, requiring minor changes in e.g. the XmlFile
class output routines.
</ul>

In addition, JDOM 2 uses generics in it's input parameters and return values.  This
means you can remove (now redundant) casts in many places.  Jenkins will warn about those.
