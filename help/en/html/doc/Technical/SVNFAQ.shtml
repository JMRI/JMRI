      <h1>JMRI Code: Subversion FAQ</h1>

      <p class="important">JMRI has migrated from Subversion (SVN) to Git in September 2015. For
      our current Version Control FAQ, please see the <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">Git FAQ</a>.</p>

      <p>This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions for Subversion, particularly regarding how we
      used it with JMRI up until 2015.</p>

      <p>See also the <a href="index.shtml">Technical index</a> for more information on maintaining
      JMRI code.</p>

      <h3>SVN Properties</h3>
      In general, we keep everything in SVN revision control, so there's no need for the various
      properties lines we used to need in CVS. These looked like

      <pre>
# The next line is maintained by CVS, please don't change it
# $Revision$
</pre>
      <p>But there are certain files, like decoder XML, properties files, etc, that users are
      likely to edit and submit back for inclusion. It is very helpful if we can identify the
      specific content that they started with.</p>

      <p>Therefore, for html, XML, python and properties files, we do:</p>

      <pre>
svn propset svn:keywords "Date Revision Version Id Author" {}
</pre>That way SVN will fill in those tags if/when they're present and the file is changed.
