      <h1>JMRI: Building with Eclipse</h1>

      <p>Eclipse (available at <a href=
      "http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</a>) can be used for working with
      JMRI. Due to the lack of integration between Ant (the primary JMRI build
      tool) and Eclipse,
      <a href="Netbeans.shtml">NetBeans</a> is recommended unless you are
      already familiar with Eclipse.</p>

      <p>Eclipse is a complex environment to work with. If you're
      already familiar with IDEs like Microsoft Visual Studio it
      won't be too hard to get used to, but it is definitely worth
      buying a textbook (e.g. <a href=
      "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321305027/qid=1124158635">
      The Java Developer's Guide to Eclipse</a>).</p>

      <p>JMRI developers use Git for source control. Source control
      using Git is including as part of the Eclipse "Oxygen"
      download. For more information or an alternate method for
      getting the JMRI source, see <a href="getgitcode.shtml">JMRI:
      Getting the Code</a>.</p>

      <p>These instructions were developed and tested using
      "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" version "Oxygen
      Release (4.7.0)".</p>

      <p>Note that you must also install the
      <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java Development Kit</a>
      (not included with Eclipse) to build JMRI with Eclipse.

      <p>If using versions of Eclipse older than "Mars", the
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/">M2Eclipse</a> plugin must be
      installed in Eclipse.</p>

      <p>Also note that at the time of writing this help document
      that JMRI requires Java version 8. You must confirm that JRE
      8 is the default Java Runtime Environment. Eclipse recommends
      installing release "Luna" or later for Java 8, but there are workarounds
      described online.</p><a name="getwgit" id="getwgit"></a>

      <h2>Getting the JMRI Source using Git</h2>To get the source
      code from GitHub using Git you need to do the following:

      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and
        create an account.</li>

        <li>Then open Eclipse.</li>

        <li>From the main menu bar select "File" then
        "Import..."</li>

        <li>Click on "Git" then "Project from Git" then the "Next"
        button.</li>

        <li>Now select the repository source by clicking on "Clone
        URI". The Source Git Repository screen should appear.</li>
      </ol><a href=
      "images/EclipseSourceGitRepository.png"><img src="images/EclipseSourceGitRepository.png"
      width="350" height="312" alt="Eclipse Git pane"></a>

      <ol>
        <li>Enter the URI "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI".</li>

        <li>Enter your GitHub username and password in the
        authentication fields.</li>

        <li>Click the "Next" button and the Branch Selection screen
        should appear.</li>
      </ol><a href="images/EclipseGitBranchSelection.png"><img src=
      "images/EclipseGitBranchSelection.png" width="350" height=
      "312" alt="Eclipse Branch pane"></a>

      <ol>
        <li>Select the branches you want to install. If you're not
        sure which branches you need, select just the "master"
        branch. This branch contains the latest code for JMRI.</li>

        <li>Click the "Next" button and the Local Destination
        screen should appear.</li>

        <li>Press the "Next" button if the local destination is
        acceptable to you.</li>

        <li>The download will now happen. It might take a while.</li>

        <li>Next select the "Wizard for project import", use "Import existing Eclipse project" then "Next"</li>

        <li>Select "Finish" to complete the import.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>After the import is complete the Eclipse Package
      Explorer should look like this:</p><a href=
      "images/EclipsePackageExplorer.png"><img src=
      "images/EclipsePackageExplorer.png" width="350" height="312"
      alt="Eclipse Package Explorer pane"></a>

      <p>Note that the first build can take a while and will require Internet
        access.</p>
        
      <p>If you get the error "Cannot read lifecycle mapping for artifact", open the "Run" menu, select "Run As",
      and then select "Maven generate-sources" to fix the error and start the first build.</p>

      <p>To run an application do the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>From the "Run" menu, select "Run Configurations..."

        <li>On the left side, expand "Maven Build".</li>

        <li>Select "JMRI DecoderPro" or "JMRI PanelPro".</li>

        <li>Optional, select the "Common" tab, the section on
        "Display in favorites menu", check the box next to "Run"</li>

        <li>Click "Run" to run the application. Eclipse will retain the
        build in the Run menu.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Pushing changes to your GitHub branch</h2>

      <p>The standard
      practice for getting your changes included in main JMRI code
      repository is to commit them to your local repository
      periodically, then when ready to publish "push" an entire set
      of changes to a repository belonging to you on GitHub, and
      then finally making a request for somebody to "pull" your
      changes into the main JMRI repository. See <a href=
      "GitFAQ.shtml">JMRI: Git FAQ</a> "Setting up a Git
      environment for JMRI Developers" for more information.</p>

      <p>It is also good practice to "pull" all of the recent
      changes from the main JMRI repository before performing your
      commits. After a "pull" your workspace and eventually your
      remote GitHub repository will be in synch with the main JMRI
      repository. To perform a "pull" select your project, then
      "Team" then "Pull" from the menu.</p>

      <p>If you want to see which files are going to be modified
      before the "Pull", you can use the "Team Synchronizing"
      feature. To do so, right click on your project, the "Team"
      then "Synchronize Workspace"</p>

      <p>Pushing to your GitHub branch:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First, commit your changes to the local repository on
        your computer

          <p>To commit a set of changes, right click on the project
          that you want to commit, and select "Team" followed by
          "Commit". Enter a commit message and select the files you
          wish to commit.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Next, "push" a set of changes from your local
        repository to your repository on GitHub. (You do this so
        others can access it and pick it up for inclusion into
        JMRI)

          <p>Before you can push your changes to GitHub for the
          first time, you'll have to <a href=
          "gitdeveloper.shtml#repo">create your own GitHub
          repository</a> (which you may have done above) and "fork"
          the JMRI repository. Log on to your account at <a href=
          "https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and then navigate to
          the JMRI repository <a href=
          "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI</a>
          In the upper right hand corner of the page you will find
          a button labeled "Fork". Press the "Fork" button to
          create your own repository of the JMRI source.</p>

          <p>To push to your GitHub repository, again select "Team"
          then "Remote" then "Configure Push to Upstream". In the
          "Configure Push" window, click on the "Push URIs" and
          then the "Add" button. In the "New URI" window enter the
          URL of your GitHub repository along with your username
          and password. After pressing "Finish" the "Configure
          Push" window should look like the image
          below:</p><a href="images/EclipseConfigurePush.png"><img src="images/EclipseConfigurePush.png"
          width="350" height="322" alt="Eclipse Error pane"></a>

          <p>Press either the "Save and Push" or the "Save" button.
          Later when you want to push new changes to your
          repository on GitHub, you can simply commit them as
          described above, and then use the "Push" icon in the
          Synchronize window.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Finally, submit a "Pull Request" to the main JMRI code
        repository on the GitHub website.

          <p>To do this, start by signing on to the <a href=
          "http://github.com">GitHub web site</a>, selecting your
          repository and clicking the <a href=
          "gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">Pull Request button</a>. For
          more info, see the <a href=
          "gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">developer instructions,</a></p>
        </li>
      </ul><a name="errors" id="errors"></a>

      <h2>Compiler Errors and Warnings</h2>

      As of 10/18/2017 there's roughly 4300 warnings being reported by the Eclipse. You can ignore these for now.
