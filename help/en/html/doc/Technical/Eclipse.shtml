      <h1>JMRI: Building with Eclipse</h1>

      <p>Eclipse (available at <a href=
      "http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</a>) makes a great
      platform for working with JMRI.</p>

      <p>Eclipse is a complex environment to work with. If you're
      already familiar with IDEs like Microsoft Visual Studio it
      won't be too hard to get used to, but it is definitely worth
      buying a textbook (e.g. <a href=
      "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321305027/qid=1124158635">
      The Java Developer's Guide to Eclipse</a>).</p>

      <p>JMRI developers use Git for source control. Source control
      using Git is including as part of the Eclipse "Luna"
      download. For more information or an alternate method for
      getting the JMRI source, see <a href="getgitcode.shtml">JMRI:
      Getting the Code</a>.</p>

      <p>These instructions were developed and tested using
      "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" version "Luna Service
      Release 1a (4.4.1)".</p>

      <p>Also note that at the time of writing this help document
      that JMRI requires JAVA version 8. You must confirm that JRE
      8 is the default Java Runtime Environment. Eclipse recommends
      installing release Luna for Java 8, but there are workarounds
      described online.</p><a name="getwgit"></a>

      <h2>Getting the JMRI Source using Git</h2>To get the source
      code from GitHub using Git you need to do the following:

      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and
        create an account.</li>

        <li>Then open Eclipse.</li>

        <li>From the main menu bar select "File" then
        "Import..."</li>

        <li>Click on "Git" then "Project from Git" then the "Next"
        button.</li>

        <li>Now select the repository source by clicking on "Clone
        URI". The Source Git Repository screen should appear.</li>
      </ol><a href=
      "images/EclipseSourceGitRepository.png"><img src="images/EclipseSourceGitRepository.png"
      width="350" height="312" alt="Eclipse Git pane"></a>

      <ol>
        <li>Enter the URI "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI".</li>

        <li>Enter your GitHub username and password in the
        authentication fields.</li>

        <li>Click the "Next" button and the Branch Selection screen
        should appear.</li>
      </ol><a href="images/EclipseGitBranchSelection.png"><img src=
      "images/EclipseGitBranchSelection.png" width="350" height=
      "312" alt="Eclipse Branch pane"></a>

      <ol>
        <li>Select the branches you want to install. If you're not
        sure which branches you need, select just the "master"
        branch. This branch contains the latest code for JMRI.</li>

        <li>Click the "Next" button and the Local Destination
        screen should appear.</li>

        <li>Press the "Next" button if the local destination is
        acceptable to you.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>After the download is complete the Eclipse Package
      Explorer should look like this:</p><a href=
      "images/EclipsePackageExplorer.png"><img src=
      "images/EclipsePackageExplorer.png" width="350" height="312"
      alt="Eclipse Package Explorer pane"></a>

      <p>After the download is complete, Eclipse will be reporting
      an error: Project 'jmri' is missing required source folder:
      'java/tmp'. This will be fixed by running the ant build as
      described below.</p>

      <h2>Building and running JMRI using Ant</h2>We recommend that
      before you try and build and run one of the applications
      within Eclipse that you run the ant build.xml within Eclipse.
      This will create the necessary directories, load some
      resource icons, and create needed Java files using JavaCC. To
      run the ant build.xml you need to do the following:

      <ol>
        <li>Ant needs a JDK (Java Development Kit) in order to run
        the supplied "build.xml" file. The Eclipse download doesn't
        include a JDK, so you must download and install a JDK, and
        then configure ant to use the JDK.</li>

        <li>Here's a link to the Oracle site that can provide you
        with a JDK:

          <p><a href=
          "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
          http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a></p>
        </li>

        <li>Select the build.xml file using the Package Explorer,
        then right click, and a menu should appear.</li>

        <li>Now select "Run As" then "2 Ant Build".</li>

        <li>Confirm that under the menu tab JRE that you've
        selected a JDK, not a JRE.</li>

        <li>Now press the "Run" button, this should start the ant
        build.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If the ant build fails, most likely it is because you need
      a JDK (Java Development Kit) rather than a JRE (Java Runtime
      Environment) which is the default. To change the JRE, select
      "Run As" "2 Ant Build" and a new window should appear. Select
      the "JRE" tab. The change the JRE, select the "Separate JRE:"
      radio button, and then press the "Installed JREs" button. If
      you don't see a JDK, you need to add one (from site
      above).</p>

      <p>If the ant build succeeds, you can now launch any of the
      JMRI applications from ant, and create a jmri.jar file if you
      wish. Use the "2 Ant Build" and in the window select the
      "Targets" tab, and use the appropriate checkbox to generate
      what you want.</p><a name="build"></a>

      <h2>Building and running JMRI using Eclipse</h2>

      <p>After completing the ant build as described above, you
      need to refresh the jmri directory. Right click on the jmri
      directory name and select "Refresh". The refresh operation
      should trigger a build of the workspace and the build should
      complete without error.</p>

      <p>To run an application do the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>You need to verify the compiler compliance level is set
        to java 1.8. Select under the main control bar
        "Window-&gt;Preferences", then select
        "Java-&gt;Compiler".</li>

        <li>From the "Run" menu, select "Run Configurations..."
        We'll use the window that opens to configure which
        program(s) to run. (If the Run menu does not have a "Run
        Configurations..." entry, be sure you selected the java
        directory in the navigation pane above - Eclipse menus are
        context sensitive)</li>

        <li>On the left side, highlight "Java Application", then
        press the "New" icon above it. The icon looks like a
        document with a plus sign on the upper-right.</li>

        <li>You should now have a new "Main" tab highlighted. Above
        that, replace "New_configuration" with "DecoderPro". Below
        it, enter "jmri" (lower case important) for "Project:" and
        "apps.DecoderPro.DecoderPro" for "Main class:".</li>

        <li>Select the "Arguments" tab, and under VM arguments
        enter (You should probably cut and paste):<br>
          <pre>
-Xms10m
-Xmx300m
-Djava.security.policy=lib/security.policy 
-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true
</pre>If you're using a 32 bit windows system add the library path:
          <pre>
-Djava.library.path=.;lib;lib/windows/x86 
</pre>Note if you're using a 64 bit windows system change the
library path to:
          <pre>
-Djava.library.path=.;lib;lib/windows/x64
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Optional, select the "Common" tab, the section on
        "Display in favorites menu", check the boxes next to "Run"
        and "Debug"</li>

        <li>If you'd like to create targets to make it easy to run
        PanelPro and AllTests, repeat the above steps to create a
        new "Java Application" except specifying
        "apps.PanelPro.PanelPro" and "apps.tests.AllTest"
        respectively.</li>

        <li>Click "Apply", then "Close" (You could click "Run" at
        this point, but we've got a little more to do)</li>

        <li>You should now be back to the usual Eclipse navigator
        view, where most development work is done. To see some
        particular java file, expand the "java" folder at the left,
        then the "src" folder, navigating down to the file you
        want.</li>

        <li>To run DecoderPro, select it under "Run History" from
        the "Run" menu. Once you've done that once, you can just
        click the "Run" icon on the toolbar to rerun the last
        program.</li>
      </ol><a name="javacc"></a>

      <h2>Installing JavaCC Plugin (alternative to Run As Ant Build
      method above)</h2>Instead of using the ant build to populate
      the "tmp" directory, you can install the JavaCC plugin.
      Here's the steps:

      <ol>
        <li>Download the Eclipse JavaCC plugin following the
        instructions found here: <a href=
        "http://eclipse-javacc.sourceforge.net">http://eclipse-javacc.sourceforge.net</a></li>

        <li>After restarting Eclipse, right click on the java
        directory in the Project Explorer or Navigator and select
        JavaCC Options.</li>

        <li>On the JavaCC Options tab, enter the output directory
        to be java/tmp/jmri/jmris/srcp/parser</li>

        <li>On the JJTree options page, enter the output directory
        to be java/tmp/jmri/jmris/srcp/parser</li>

        <li>Confirm that the "Java Build Path" includes the tmp
        directory (see Project Properties).</li>
      </ol><a name="push"></a>

      <h2>Pushing changes to your GitHub branch</h2>The standard
      practice for getting your changes included in main JMRI code
      repository is to commit them to your local repository
      periodically, then when ready to publish "push" an entire set
      of changes to a repository belonging to you on GitHub, and
      then finally making a request for somebody to "pull" your
      changes into the main JMRI repository. See <a href=
      "GitFAQ.shtml">JMRI: Git FAQ</a> "Setting up a Git
      environment for JMRI Developers" for more information.

      <p>It is also good practice to "pull" all of the recent
      changes from the main JMRI repository before performing your
      commits. After a "pull" your workspace and eventually your
      remote GitHub repository will be in synch with the main JMRI
      repository. To perform a "pull" select your project, then
      "Team" then "Pull" from the menu.</p>

      <p>If you want to see which files are going to be modified
      before the "Pull", you can use the "Team Synchronizing"
      feature. To do so, right click on your project, the "Team"
      then "Synchronize Workspace"</p>

      <p>Pushing to your GitHub branch:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First, commit your changes to the local repository on
        your computer

          <p>To commit a set of changes, right click on the project
          that you want to commit, and select "Team" followed by
          "Commit". Enter a commit message and select the files you
          wish to commit.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Next, "push" a set of changes from your local
        repository to your repository on GitHub. (You do this so
        others can access it and pick it up for inclusion into
        JMRI)

          <p>Before you can push your changes to GitHub for the
          first time, you'll have to <a href=
          "gitdeveloper.shtml#repo">create your own GitHub
          repository</a> (which you may have done above) and "fork"
          the JMRI repository. Log on to your account at <a href=
          "https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and then navigate to
          the JMRI repository <a href=
          "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI</a>
          In the upper right hand corner of the page you will find
          a button labeled "Fork". Press the "Fork" button to
          create your own repository of the JMRI source.</p>

          <p>To push to your GitHub repository, again select "Team"
          then "Remote" then "Configure Push to Upstream". In the
          "Configure Push" window, click on the "Push URIs" and
          then the "Add" button. In the "New URI" window enter the
          URL of your GitHub repository along with your username
          and password. After pressing "Finish" the "Configure
          Push" window should look like the image
          below:</p><a href="images/EclipseConfigurePush.png"><img src="images/EclipseConfigurePush.png"
          width="350" height="322" alt="Eclipse Error pane"></a>

          <p>Press either the "Save and Push" or the "Save" button.
          Later when you want to push new changes to your
          repository on GitHub, you can simply commit them as
          described above, and then use the "Push" icon in the
          Synchronize window.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Finally, submit a "Pull Request" to the main JMRI code
        repository on the GitHub website.

          <p>To do this, start by signing on to the <a href=
          "http://github.com">GitHub web site</a>, selecting your
          repository and clicking the <a href=
          "gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">Pull Request button</a>. For
          more info, see the <a href=
          "gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">developer instructions,</a></p>
        </li>
      </ul><a name="errors"></a>

      <h2>Compiler Errors and Warnings</h2>The default Eclipse
      compiler configuration produces many unnecessary warnings.
      You can adjust the warnings to match the screen shots as
      shown below by going to Window -&gt; Preferences and
      selecting "Java -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Errors/Warnings".
