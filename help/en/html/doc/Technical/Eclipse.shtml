      <h1>JMRI Code: Building with Eclipse</h1>

      <p>Eclipse (available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</a>) can be used
      for working with JMRI. Due to the lack of integration between Ant (the primary JMRI build
      tool) and Eclipse, <a href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a> is recommended unless you are
      already familiar with Eclipse.</p>

      <p>Eclipse is a complex environment to work with. If you're already familiar with IDEs like
      Microsoft Visual Studio it won't be too hard to get used to, but it is definitely worth
      buying a textbook (e.g. <a href=
      "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321305027/qid=1124158635">The Java
      Developer's Guide to Eclipse</a>).</p>

      <p>JMRI developers use Git for source control. Source control using Git is including as part
      of the Eclipse "Oxygen" download. For more information or an alternate method for getting the
      JMRI source, see <a href="getgitcode.shtml">JMRI: Getting the Code</a>.</p>

      <p>These instructions were developed and tested using "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"
      version "Oxygen Release (4.7.0)".</p>

      <p>Note that you must also install a <strong>Java Development Kit (JDK)</strong> (not
      included with Eclipse) to build JMRI with Eclipse.</p>

      <p>If using versions of Eclipse older than "Mars", the <a href=
      "http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/">M2Eclipse</a> plugin must be installed in Eclipse.</p>

      <p>Also note that since version 4.99 JMRI requires Java version
      11. You must confirm that JRE 11 is the default Java Runtime Environment.</p>

      <h2 id="getgit">Eclipse version "Proton" and later</h2>
      <p>The "Proton" and later versions of Eclipse require a Maven project update after downloading
      the JMRI source files. To do this, right click "jmri [...]" in the Package Explorer, then in
      the menu, select "Maven" and in the sub menu "Update project ...". After the update is
      complete, do a project clean to rebuild the source files.</p>

      <h2>Getting the JMRI Source using Git</h2>
      <p>To get the source code from GitHub using Git you need to do the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and create an account.
        </li>

        <li>Then open Eclipse.</li>

        <li>From the main menu bar select "File" then "Import..."</li>

        <li>Click on "Git" then "Project from Git" then the "Next" button.</li>

        <li>Now select the repository source by clicking on "Clone URI". The Source Git Repository
        screen should appear.</li>
      </ol>
      <a href="images/EclipseSourceGitRepository.png"><img src=
      "images/EclipseSourceGitRepository.png" alt="Eclipse Git pane"></a>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter the URI "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI".</li>

        <li>Enter your GitHub username and password in the authentication fields.</li>

        <li>Click the "Next" button and the Branch Selection screen should appear.</li>
      </ol>
      <a href="images/EclipseGitBranchSelection.png"><img src=
      "images/EclipseGitBranchSelection.png" alt="Eclipse Branch pane"></a>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the branches you want to install. If you're not sure which branches you need,
        select just the "master" branch. This branch contains the latest code for JMRI.</li>

        <li>Click the "Next" button and the Local Destination screen should appear.</li>

        <li>Press the "Next" button if the local destination is acceptable to you.</li>

        <li>The download will now happen. It might take a while.</li>

        <li>Next select the "Wizard for project import", use "Import existing Eclipse project" then
        "Next"</li>

        <li>Select "Finish" to complete the import.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>After the import is complete the Eclipse Package Explorer should look like this:</p>
      <a href="images/EclipsePackageExplorer.png"><img src="images/EclipsePackageExplorer.png"
      alt="Eclipse Package Explorer pane"></a>
      <p>Note that the first build can take a while and will require Internet access.</p>

      <p>If you get the error "Cannot read lifecycle mapping for artifact", open the "Run" menu,
      select "Run As", and then select "Maven generate-sources" to fix the error and start the
      first build.</p>

      <p>To run an application do the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>From the "Run" menu, select "Run Configurations..."</li>

        <li>On the left side, expand "Maven Build".</li>

        <li>Select "JMRI DecoderPro" or "JMRI PanelPro".</li>

        <li>Optional, select the "Common" tab, the section on "Display in favorites menu", check
        the box next to "Run"</li>

        <li>Click "Run" to run the application. Eclipse will retain the build in the Run menu.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>To run an application native to Eclipse you might need the communication library. For for
      the application you want to run, select the "Arguments" tab, and under VM argments enter (You
      should probably cut and paste): If you're using a 32 bit windows system add the library
      path:</p>

      <pre>
          -Djava.library.path=.;lib;lib/windows/x86
          </pre>Note if you're using a 64 bit windows system change the library path to:

      <pre>
          -Djava.library.path=.;lib;lib/windows/x64
          </pre>
      <p>If during the launch of DecoderPro or PanelPro the program hangs, or errors are reported
      to the console, there's a good chance that the META-INT files weren't created. To fix, run
      the Ant "build.xml" as described below with only two targets selected, "realclean" followed
      by "panelpro". If the Ant build succeeds, you should see the program launch the main PanelPro
      panel.</p>

      <p>We also recommend that you deselect "Scrub output folders when cleaning projects" found
      under Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java-&gt;Building-&gt;Output folder. This keeps the META-INT
      files in place after they are created by the Ant build.</p>

      <p>Afterwards refresh the project, and then do a project clean. The clean should fire off a
      build and hopefully cleanup the errors.</p>

      <h2>Building and running JMRI using Ant</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Ant needs a JDK (Java Development Kit) in order to run the supplied "build.xml" file.
        The Eclipse download doesn't include a JDK, so you must download and install a JDK, and
        then configure ant to use the JDK.</li>

        <li>Select the build.xml file using the Package Explorer, then right click, and a menu
        should appear.</li>

        <li>Now select "Run As" then "2 Ant Build".</li>

        <li>Confirm under the menu tab "JRE" that you've selected a JDK, not a JRE.</li>

        <li>Now press the "Run" button, this should start the ant build.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If the ant build fails, most likely it is because you need a JDK (Java Development Kit)
      rather than a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which is the default. To change the JRE, select
      "Run As" "2 Ant Build" and a new window should appear. Select the "JRE" tab. The change the
      JRE, select the "Separate JRE:" radio button, and then press the "Installed JREs" button. If
      you don't see a JDK, you need to add one (from site above).<br>
      A new JMRI checkout should build cleanly. If not, please check with the JMRIusers or
      jmri-developers mailings lists for help.</p>

      <p>If the ant build succeeds, you can now launch any of the JMRI applications from ant, and
      create a jmri.jar file if you wish. Use the "2 Ant Build" and in the window select the
      "Targets" tab, and use the appropriate checkbox to generate what you want. Two targets that
      are worth running if you're experiencing error messages in the Eclipse console window are
      "realclean" followed by "panelpro".</p>

      <h2 id="build">Pushing changes to your GitHub branch</h2>

      <p>The standard practice for getting your changes included in main JMRI code repository is to
      commit them to your local repository periodically, then when ready to publish "push" an
      entire set of changes to a repository belonging to you on GitHub, and then finally making a
      request for somebody to "pull" your changes into the main JMRI repository. See <a href=
      "GitFAQ.shtml">JMRI: Git FAQ</a> "Setting up a Git environment for JMRI Developers" for more
      information.</p>

      <p>It is also good practice to "pull" all of the recent changes from the main JMRI repository
      before performing your commits. After a "pull" your workspace and eventually your remote
      GitHub repository will be in synch with the main JMRI repository. To perform a "pull" select
      your project, then "Team" then "Pull" from the menu.</p>

      <p>If you want to see which files are going to be modified before the "Pull", you can use the
      "Team Synchronizing" feature. To do so, right click on your project, the "Team" then
      "Synchronize Workspace"</p>

      <p>Pushing to your GitHub branch:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First, commit your changes to the local repository on your computer
          <p>To commit a set of changes, right click on the project that you want to commit, and
          select "Team" followed by "Commit". Enter a commit message and select the files you wish
          to commit.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Next, "push" a set of changes from your local repository to your repository on GitHub.
        (You do this so others can access it and pick it up for inclusion into JMRI)
          <p>Before you can push your changes to GitHub for the first time, you'll have to <a href=
          "gitdeveloper.shtml#repo">create your own GitHub repository</a> (which you may have done
          above) and "fork" the JMRI repository. Log on to your account at <a href=
          "https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and then navigate to the JMRI repository <a href=
          "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI</a> In the upper right hand
          corner of the page you will find a button labeled "Fork". Press the "Fork" button to
          create your own repository of the JMRI source.</p>

          <p>To push to your GitHub repository, again select "Team" then "Remote" then "Configure
          Push to Upstream". In the "Configure Push" window, click on the "Push URIs" and then the
          "Add" button. In the "New URI" window enter the URL of your GitHub repository along with
          your username and password. After pressing "Finish" the "Configure Push" window should
          look like the image below:</p>
          <a href="images/EclipseConfigurePush.png"><img src="images/EclipseConfigurePush.png"
          alt="Eclipse Error pane"></a>
          <p>Press either the "Save and Push" or the "Save" button. Later when you want to push new
          changes to your repository on GitHub, you can simply commit them as described above, and
          then use the "Push" icon in the Synchronize window.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Finally, submit a "Pull Request" to the main JMRI code repository on the GitHub
        website.
          <p>To do this, start by signing on to the <a href="http://github.com">GitHub web
          site</a>, selecting your repository and clicking the <a href=
          "gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">Pull Request button</a>. For more info, see the <a href=
          "gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">developer instructions,</a></p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="errors">Compiler Errors and Warnings</h2>
      As of 5/10/2020 roughly 4600 warnings were being reported by the Eclipse. You can ignore
      these for now.
      <h2>JUnit Testing and Test Coverage</h2>
      If you wish to run the test coverage tool, you need to add this VM argument to the run
      configuration:

      <pre>
   -Djmri.shutdownmanager=jmri.util.MockShutDownManager
   </pre>
      <p>If you want to run a test coverage report accessing all of the tests in sub-directories,
      you'll need to create a test class that will invoke all of the tests within a directory and
      sub-directories. Below is an example that will run all of the tests in the directory
      "jmri.jmrit.operations":</p>
