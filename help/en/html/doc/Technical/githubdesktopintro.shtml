      <h1>JMRI: Using GitHub Desktop</h1>
      First some useful definitions:
      <dl>
        <dt>Git:</dt>

        <dd>A version control system, used by the developers of JMRI</dd>

        <dt>GitHub:</dt>

        <dd>A web site and a host for projects using Git</dd>

        <dt>GitHub Desktop:</dt>

        <dd>A graphical front end for Git.</dd>
      </dl>
      Before using GitHub Desktop, we need to fork the JMRI repository to our own repository. For
      this, we log in to https://github.com/ , go to the JMRI repository
      https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI and click the button "Fork" on the top right side of the GitHub
      web site.
      <p>We then start GitHub Desktop. We now need to clone our JMRI repository to the local
      computer.<br>

      width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      This tutorial was created by GitHub user danielb987 so the JMRI repository is
      danielb987/JMRI.</p>

      <p>Depending on the speed of the Internet connection, cloning the JMRI repository to your
      computer may take a while. It's about two gigabyte of data to download. Be patient!</p>

      <h3>GitHub Desktop user interface</h3>
      <br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_3_GitHubDesktop.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_3_GitHubDesktop.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      The GitHub Desktop application has on the top a menu. It can also be accessed by pressing the
      "Alt" key, which is useful if GitHub Desktop is in full screen mode and the menu is
      invisible.
      <p>Below the menu, there is three "buttons": Current repository, current branch and the
      Fetch-button. The button "Current branch" is used to select another branch or to create a new
      branch. Note that branches are cheap, so there is no problem creating new ones as needed.</p>

      <p>The last button, "Fetch origin", sends data to and from the GitHub web server. When it
      says "Fetch origin", it only sync the computer with the server, but once there is commits to
      either download from the GitHub server to the local computer, or commits to upload from the
      local computer to the server, this button will tell you about it and once you press the
      button, the commits will be downloaded or uploaded to the server.</p>

      <h3>Keeping our branches up to date with JMRI</h3>
      There are several developers on the JMRI project, adding and changing code all the time. We
      therefore need to keep our local branches up to date with the JMRI master branch.
      <p>First, select the "master" branch to keep it up to date with the JMRI master branch. Then
      go to the main menu, click on "Branch" and "Merge into current branch".<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_4_MergeInto.png"><img src="images/GHD_Image_4_MergeInto.png"
      height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      Then select the upstream/master branch. It's at the bottom of the list.<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_5_MergeInto.png"><img src="images/GHD_Image_5_MergeInto.png"
      height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      The text "20 hours ago" tells you when the last change was made to the upstream/master
      branch. The text "This will merge 14 commits from upstream/master into master" tells you how
      many commits that are to be merged, from which branch and to which branch. Ensure you have
      choosen the correct branches!</p>

      <p>Click on the button "Merge upstream/master into master" to do the merge. When it's finish,
      you will see this:<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_6_MergeIntoDone.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_6_MergeIntoDone.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      The button "Fetch origin" has now changed its name to "Push origin". The number 14 tells that
      there is 14 commits to upload to the server.</p>

      <p>But wait! Why do we want to _upload_ the commits? Haven't we just downloaded them from
      JMRI?</p>

      <p>Yes, we have downloaded the commits from upstream/master into our local master on the
      local computer. It's now time to upload these commits to our repository on the GitHub
      server.</p>

      <p>What's happening is this: We are working with three different repositories. For me, my
      user name on GitHub is danielb987, so I'm working with these three repositories:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>JMRI/JMRI - The main repository for the JMRI project on the GitHub server</li>

        <li>danielb987/JMRI - My repository on the GitHub server</li>

        <li>The repository on the local computer</li>
      </ul>
      What has happen is that we merged "upstream/master" from JMRI/JMRI to our "master" branch in
      our repository on our local computer. Then we need to upload the changes to our "master"
      branch on our local computer to our GitHub repository on the GitHub server, which for me is
      "danielb987/JMRI".
      <h3>The workflow of JMRI development</h3>
      The workflow we use:
      <ol>
        <li>Select the branch "master"</li>

        <li>Ensure "master" is up to date with upstream/master. If it's not, we merge branch
        "upstream/master" into "master" sa previously described.</li>

        <li>Create a new branch. Please use only english letters, digits and underscore for the
        name of the branch. GitHub Desktop can handle international characters, but if you need
        help from one of the maintainers, it can be tricky for them to handle the branch if it has
        international characters. Note that "branches" are cheap. It's no problem to have many of
        them.</li>

        <li>Do a commit then a part of the work is finished. It's often better to have many small
        commits than one big commit. But it's good if the project at least can compile each
        commit.</li>

        <li>Do the work you need. If it takes a long time, it's highly recommended to merge
        upstream/master into the branch once a week.</li>

        <li>Once the work is done, a "Pull Request" is created. A Pull Request, or PR, is a way to
        tell the maintainers of JMRI that you have done this work and you want it included into
        JMRI.</li>

        <li>Then a Pull Request, PR, is created, some automatic tools, for example Travis and Code
        Climate, will start to compile the code and run a big number of tests against it. Most, but
        not all, of these tools must succeed for the maintainers to be able to merge your work into
        JMRI.</li>

        <li>Once the automatic tools are finished, the maintainers will look at the Pull Request
        and check it, and if everything seems OK they will merge your work into JMRI.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Creating a new branch to work with</h3>
      First select the master branch and ensure it's up to date. If it's not, please merge
      upstream/master into master. Se above.
      <p>Click on the button "Current branch" and then click on the button "New branch" and give
      the new branch a name.<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_7_NewBranch.png"><img src="images/GHD_Image_7_NewBranch.png"
      height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      <br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_8_NewBranchName.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_8_NewBranchName.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      It's not recommended to use international characters or spaces in the branch name. It may
      cause problems for the maintainers later.</p>

      <p>It's possible to create the branch from another branch than the master branch. For
      example, JMRI may use the branch "development" as the branch to base developent on. If this
      is the case, you select the development branch, then merge the branch "upstream/development"
      into the branch "development" and then create the branch from development. Note that if you
      do this, GitHub desktop will warn you and ask if you really want to start from the
      development branch or start from the master branch. Select the "development" branch in this
      case.<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_9_NewBranch_Development.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_9_NewBranch_Development.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      When a new branch is created, it only exists on your local computer. In order to push it to
      the server, we click on the button "Publish branch".<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_10_PublishBranch.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_10_PublishBranch.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br></p>

      <h3>Do a commit</h3>
      Using your favourite development tool, for example Eclipse or NetBeans, do the changes you
      want. For the purpose of this text, we create a simple class HelloWord.java.<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_11_NewClass.png"><img src="images/GHD_Image_11_NewClass.png"
      height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      GitHub Desktop will now show the changes we have done, in this case added a new class. We add
      a description for the commit that describes what this commit does and then click on the
      button "Commit to ...". The branch we are commiting to is "hello_world" so the button shows
      "Commit to hello_world".<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_12_CreateCommit.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_12_CreateCommit.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      We then click the button "Push origin" to upload our commit to the GitHub server. Note that
      this sends the commit to my repository, not the JMRI repository.
      <h3>Create a Pull Request, PR</h3>
      When we have done the commits we want, it's time to do a Pull Request, PR. It tells the
      maintainers of JMRI that you want this code to be included into JMRI.
      <p>In order to do that, we click on the button "Create Pull Request".<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_13_CreatePullRequest.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_13_CreatePullRequest.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      This will open a web browser. If you are not logged in to GitHub, you need to log in. When
      you have logged in, you will see the web page for creation of a Pull Request.<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_14_CreatePullRequest.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_14_CreatePullRequest.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      Fill in a title and a description of the Pull Request and click on the button "Create Pull
      Request".</p>

      <p>Sometimes you may want to do some more work on the Pull Request before it's merged, or you
      may want somebody else to look at it. In these cases, you can mark the Pull Request as "Work
      In Progress" by writing the letters WIP in the title.<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_15_CreatePullRequest.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_15_CreatePullRequest.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      After the Pull Request is created, the following page is shown.<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_16_CreatePullRequestDone.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_16_CreatePullRequestDone.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      Below "Some checks haven't completed yet" is a list of tools that runs a lot of automatic
      tests. These tools compile the code, run the tests and checks that everything is correct. If
      a check is successful, it will have a green check mark, otherwise it will have a red
      cross.</p>

      <p>Not all tests need to be successful for the Pull Request to be merged, only the ones
      marked with "Required", but it's good if all tests are successful.</p>

      <p>After that, you will have to wait for one of the maintainers to take a look at your Pull
      Request and hopefully merge it into JMRI.</p>

      <h3>Handling a conflict</h3>
      There are many programmers working on JMRI simulantiously. This means that it happens that
      two persons are working at the same piece of code the same time. Most often, Git will be able
      to handle that, but in some cases conflicts appears that needs to be handled manually.
      <p>In our example, we have the method hello():</p>

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">

    public void hello() {
        System.out.print("Hello");
        System.out.println("World");
    }

Lets add a row:

    public void hello() {
        System.out.print("Hello");
        System.out.print(" my ");
        System.out.println("World");
    }
</pre><br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_17_Conflict.png"><img src="images/GHD_Image_17_Conflict.png"
      height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      On the right side, you will now see that a new line has been added at row 14. We do a commit
      and upload it to the server.
      <p>Now we want to keep up with upstream/master, so we merge "upstream/master" into "master",
      and then "master" into our branch "hello_world". We select the branch "master" and merge
      "upstream/master" into our "master" branch and then select the branch "hello_world" and merge
      the branch "master" into "hello_world".</p>

      <p>(For the case of demonstration, I use the branch hello_world2 to show a conflict).</p>

      <p>We now have a problem! Some other guy has made a change in the same code as we, and there
      is a conflict! GitHub tells that there is one conflicting file between the two branches we
      want to merge.</p>

      <p>In order to solve that, we click on the button "Merge ...".<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_19_Conflict.png"><img src="images/GHD_Image_19_Conflict.png"
      height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      GitHub now protects us from doing too much damage by requiring us to fix the conflict before
      we can commit the merge. We have to solve the conflict or abort the merge.</p>

      <p>To solve the conflict, we open the conflicting file in our editor, for example
      NetBeans.<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_20_ConflictSolving.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_20_ConflictSolving.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      The strange code that is in the file shows there the conflict is, or in some cases there may
      even be several conflicts in the file.</p>

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    public void hello() {
        System.out.print("Hello");
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
        System.out.print(" my ");
=======
        System.out.print(" your ");
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hello_world2
        System.out.println("World");
    }
</pre>There is two parts here. First, beginning with "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD" is the
code we want to have. This code goes down to the line "=======". Below that are the code that
someone else wants to have, and that code goes down to "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hello_world2".
In this case, I have used the branch "hello_world2" to get a conflict, but most often you will have
merge master into your branch so this line will be "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; master".
      <p>What we need to do is to decide if we should keep the original code, replace it with our
      own, or do something different. The key is to understand what the code does and to make a
      good decision. If in question, please ask at the JMRI developer mailing list.</p>

      <p>In this case, we resolve this by changing the line to:</p>

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        System.out.print(" our ");
</pre><br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_21_ConflictSolving.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_21_ConflictSolving.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
      Then we go back to GitHub Desktop, we see that the conflict is solved and we can now merge
      the commit.<br>
      <a href="images/GHD_Image_22_ConflictSolving.png"><img src=
      "images/GHD_Image_22_ConflictSolving.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""></a><br>
