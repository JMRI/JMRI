<h1>JMRI: System Structure</h1>
<p>
Historically, systems weren't arranged this way, so
existing code may not be a good example.
<p>
Want to expose very little above the jmrix package.
<p>
Basic core is communications code, often a "TrafficManager"
<p>
Tools should go in a swing sub-package
<p>
Specific connection types for a single protocol can go in 
subdirectories.
<p>
Role of ConnectionConfig, SystemConnectionMemo
<p>
Deprecated ActiveFlag

<a href="MultiConnectionUpdate.shtml">Multiple Connection Update</a>
page.

<h2>Initialization Sequence</h2>

This section describes the LocoNet implementation of the new (2010)
configuration system. "NN" refers to e.g. the locobuffer, pr3 or
similar connection-specific class.

<ol>
<li>jmri.jmrix.loconet.NN.configurexml.ConnectionConfigXml is invoked 
    by the configurexml mechanism when the specific class is named in an XML
    input file.

<li>The ConnectionConfigXml object
    is a child of the jmri.jmrix.configurexml.AbstractConnectionConfigXml class, 
    which invokes the getInstance() method of it (not a static
    method) in its load() method 
    to load the "adapter" member variable with a 
    specific *Adapter class, e.g. MS100Adapter.

<li>Later, after the port is (hopefully) up,
    AbstractConnectionConfigXml invokes the Adapter's 
    configure() method.
    
<li>That Adapter configure() method does, in order
    (this has now been refactored into LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo
       itself, so this list has to be reordered)
    <ol>
    <li>sets up Packetizer/port/etc as needed
    <li>configureCommandStation() from LnPortController
    <li>configureManagers() from LnPortController,
        but overridden in e.g. PR3Adapter.
    <li>does any other initialization of it's own, e.g. startThreads()
    <p>
    At this point, the system is basically up and ready for operation.
    <li>Finally, a jmri.jmrix.loconet.LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo object is
        created and registered with the InstanceManager.
    </ol>
    </li>
<li>Later, jmri.jmrix.ActiveSystemsMenu and/or jmri.jmrix.SystemsMenu
    wants to create user menus, and finds the LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo
    object in the InstanceManager
    
<li>The menu code asks that specific SystemConnectionMemo object
    to create and return the menu.  It does so, in the process
    connecting each Action to itself so that the individual tools
    will be able to connect to the proper e.g. TrafficController, 
    SlotMonitor, etc.
    
<li>When an Action is fired later on, the invoked class(es) enquire
    of the LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo when they need a resource, 
    instead of referring to an instance() method in the 
    resource's class.
    
</ol>

To adapt a type, e.g. Turnout:
<ol>
<li>Basic manager needs to have getSystemPrefix in addition to letter
<li>ProxyManager has to check for system prefix, not letter
</ol>

<h2>Application Startup</h2>
<p>
The apps.SampleMinimalProgram class provides a minimal example of starting a program
that uses JMRI.  It's got a hard-coded layout configuration. See the internal
comments for more info.
<p>
Better is to use the JMRI configuration system to read a configuration file
and do the initialization.  There's commented out code in apps.SampleMinimalProgram
that shows how to do that.
<p>
The JMRI applications themselves use a more powerful "profile" mechanism
that's inherited from the apps.Apps and apps.AppsBase classes.
