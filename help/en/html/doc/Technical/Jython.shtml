      <h1>Jython access to JMRI Tools</h1>
      <p>This page discusses
      access to the JMRI libraries from Jython, a Java version of
      Python. The emphasis is on using JMRI capabilities from a
      command-line Jython interpreter. <b>This page is not about
      scripting with Jython inside JMRI.</b> See the <a href=
      "../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">scripting pages</a> if
      you are more interested in Jython scripting within JMRI.

      <p>Note that this page is somewhat out of date; version
      numbers, etc may not be current.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2><a href=
      "http://www.python.org">Python</a> is a widely used scripting
      language that's available on many types of computers. A
      Java-based varient, called <a href=
      "http://www.jython.org">Jython</a>, has been integrated with
      JMRI to make it easy to control a model railroad from the
      command line of a computer.


      Jython and Python bring some simplifications to using JMRI code. The Java
      member function:
      <pre>
        turnout.setCommandedState(jmri.Turnout.CLOSED);
</pre>can also be expressed in Jython as:
      <pre>
        turnout.commandedState = CLOSED
</pre><br>
      This results in much easier-to-read code.

      <p>There are a lot of useful Python books and online
      tutorials. For more information on the Jython language and
      it's relations with Java, the best reference is the <a href=
      "http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jythoness/">Jython
      Essentials</a> book published by O'Reilly. The <a href=
      "http://www.jython.org/">jython.org web site</a> is also very
      useful.</p>

      <h2>Using Jython directly</h2>This section of the page is a
      pile of useful information on controlling JMRI from Jython
      directly.

      <p>Note that you don't need most of this when running the
          PanelPro.py or similar scripts, as they handle starting a
          complete application.</p>

      <h3>Initialization</h3>JMRI uses the LogJ system extensively
      for logging information during program execution. To
      configure that when running with Jython, you should do:
      <pre>
  import org
  org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.configure("default.lcf")
</pre>before starting any of the JMRI classes. The "default.lcf" is
the name of the logging control file to be used; it can be omitted.

      <p>To make JMRI classes available, you have to do:</p>
      <pre>
  import jmri
</pre>As currently set up, this does not run any initialization
code to start the hardware connections, etc. One way to do that is
to load a configuration file, perhaps one you've created earlier
via the PanelPro preferences panel:
<pre>
  import java.io
  configfile = java.io.File(jmri.util.FileUtil.getPreferencesPath()+"PanelProConfig2.xml")
  jmri.InstanceManager.setConfigureManager(jmri.configurexml.ConfigXmlManager())
  jmri.InstanceManager.getDefault(jmri.ConfigureManager.class).load(configfile)
</pre>to activate the JMRI classes and connect to your layout
hardware. "PanelProConfig2.xml" is the name of the configuration
file from the PanelPro program; you can use another name if
desired. The configuration file controls the layout connection, and
any other options that may have been set when it was created.

<p>Alternately, if you want to start the complete PanelPro
    application, including the menu bar, spash screen, etc, you
      can do:</p>
      <pre>
 import apps
 apps.PanelPro.PanelPro.main([])
      </pre>

      <p>This will start the program, including its startup
      configuration, etc.</p>

      <p>To simplify this startup even further, you can do:</p>
      <pre>
 execfile("PanelPro.py")
      </pre>to invoke these commands.

      <h3>Access to JMRI</h3>JMRI uses the factory-pattern
      extensively to get access to objects. In Java this results in
      verbose code like
      <pre>
   Turnout t2 = InstanceManager.getDefault(jmri.TurnoutManager.class).newTurnout("LT2", "turnout 2");
   t2.setCommandedState(Turnout.THROWN)
</pre>Jython simplifies that by allowing us to provide useful
variables, and by shortening certain method calls.

      <p>To get access to the SignalHead, Sensor and Turnout
      managers and the CommandStation object, several shortcut
      variables are defined in the .py scripts listed above:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>sensors</li>

        <li>signals</li>

        <li>turnouts</li>

        <li>lights</li>

        <li>reporters</li>

        <li>memories</li>

        <li>dcc</li>

        <li>audio</li>
      </ul>These can then be referenced directly in Jython as
      <pre>
   t2 = turnouts.provideTurnout("12");

   dcc.
</pre>Note that the variable t2 did not need to be declared.

      <p>Juthon provides a shortcut for parameters that have been
      defined with Java-Bean-like get and set methods:</p>
      <pre>
   t2.setCommandedState(Turnout.THROWN)
</pre>can be written as
      <pre>
   t2.commandedState = THROWN
</pre>where the assignment is actually invoking the set method.
Also note that THROWN was defined when running the Python script at
startup; CLOSED, ACTIVE, INACTIVE, RED, YELLOW and GREEN are also
defined.

      <p>A similar mechanism can be used to check the state of
      something:</p>
      <pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sensors.provideSensor("3").knownState == ACTIVE
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sensors.provideSensor("3").knownState == INACTIVE
0
</pre>Note that Jython uses "1" to indicate true, and "0" to
indicate false, so sensor 3 is currently active in this example

      <p>You can also directly invoke methods, e.g. to send a DCC
      packet to the rails you type:</p>
      <pre>

   dcc.sendPacket([0x01, 0x03, 0xbb], 4)
</pre>This sends that three-byte packet four times, and then
returns to the command line.

      <p>To exit, either ^C from the command line, or use the exit
      command from the menu.</p>

      <h2>Using Python for signal logic and automation</h2>The
      existing JMRI "<a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/package-summary.html">Automat</a>"
      classes provide hooks for user layout automation, including
      signaling. But they require that you write Java code and
      compile it into .class files, or write Jython code and import it.

    <h3>Termination</h3>
      <p>Once the JMRI main thread (or Swing GUI
      thread?) has started, ^D is not sufficient to exist the
      program. You have to select "Quit" from the actual file menu,
      or ^C the program.</p>

      <p>It would be good to understand what's preventing the
      program from stopping when it gets the <code>^D</code>.</p>
