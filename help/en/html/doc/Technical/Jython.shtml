      <h1>Jython access to JMRI tools</h1>This page discusses
      access to the JMRI libraries from Jython, a Java version of
      Python. The emphasis is on using JMRI capabilities from a
      command-line Jython interpreter. <b>This page is not about
      scripting with Jython inside JMRI.</b> See the <a href=
      "../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">scripting pages</a> if
      you are more interested in Jython scripting within JMRI.

      <p>Note that this page is somewhat out of date; version
      numbers, etc may not be current.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2><a href=
      "http://www.python.org">Python</a> is a widely used scripting
      language that's available on many types of computers. A
      Java-based varient, called <a href=
      "http://www.jython.org">Jython</a>, has been integrated with
      JMRI to make it easy to control a model railroad from the
      command line of a computer.

      <p>To use the JMRI library from Jython, you have to ensure
      that Jython will search the correct jar files when it starts
      up. We provide a "jmrithon" startup script that will do that
      for you:</p>
      <pre>
% ./jmrithon
execFileJython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
(Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 

</pre>Once you get the Jython prompt of "&gt;&gt;&gt;", you can
type Python statements.

      <p>We've provided a few Python command files to make setup
      easier.</p>

      <p>For example, you can run the PanelPro application from the
          Jython command line, which is then available for manipulating
      objects like turnouts and sensors:</p>
      <pre>
execfile("PanelPro.py")
     0 PanelPro.PanelPro                     INFO  - program starts [main]
 11109 PanelPro.PanelPro                     INFO  - main initialization done [main]

&gt;&gt;&gt; turnouts.newTurnout("LT1", "")
jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnTurnout@1a8f49

&gt;&gt;&gt; turnouts.getTurnout("LT1").getCommandedState()
1

&gt;&gt;&gt; lt1 = turnouts.getTurnout("LT1")

&gt;&gt;&gt; lt1.setCommandedState(CLOSED)

&gt;&gt;&gt; lt1.commandedState
2

&gt;&gt;&gt; lt1.commandedState = THROWN

&gt;&gt;&gt; lt1.commandedState
4

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
      </pre>Note that this is running a complete version of the PanelPro
      application; all of the windows and menus are presented the same
way, configuration is done by the preferences panel, etc. What the
Jython connection adds is a command line from which you can
directly manipulate things.<br>
      This also shows some of the simplifications that Jython and
      the Python language brings to using JMRI code. The Java
      member function:
      <pre>
        turnout.setCommandedState(jmri.Turnout.CLOSED);
</pre>can also be expressed in Jython as:
      <pre>
        turnout.commandedState = CLOSED
</pre><br>
      This results in much easier-to-read code.

      <p>There are a lot of useful Python books and online
      tutorials. For more information on the Jython language and
      it's relations with Java, the best reference is the <a href=
      "http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jythoness/">Jython
      Essentials</a> book published by O'Reilly. The <a href=
      "http://www.jython.org/">jython.org web site</a> is also very
      useful.</p>

      <h2>Setup</h2>Jython support is not (yet) standard in JMRI.
      To use this:

      <ol>
        <li>You must first have a working JMRI installation. In
        particular, start the JMRI application and configure it to
        connect to your DCC hardware, then save, quit and restart
        the program. Make sure that the connection is working for
        the menu-based tools before trying to use Jython.</li>

        <li>Download and install Jython from <a href=
        "http://www.jython.org">http://www.jython.org</a>.
        Development is using the 2.1 version, so you might want to
        start with that. On Mac OS X, the installer does not run,
        so you have to manually invoke the jython_21.class file;
        see the Mac OS X note on the jython web site. Make sure the
        installation is complete by invoking jython from the
        command line:
          <pre>
   % jython
   Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
   Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   &gt;&gt;&gt; ^D
</pre>If that works, your installation is OK. If not, you'll have
to fix the installation before you'll be able to do the next step.

          <p>If the installer didn't run, download the
          jython_21.class file from SourceForge, and enter at a
          command prompt:</p>
          <pre>
  java -cp . jython_21
</pre>then follow the prompts through the installer.

          <p>If the installer did run, but the jython command isn't
          found:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Windows: Find the jython.bat file which the
            installer created, and copy it to your C:\WINDOWS
            directory.</li>

            <li>Linux: Make sure that the jython install directory
            is on your path.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Now you just have to have the required classes in the
        CLASSPATH used when jython starts up. The required list in
        Unix syntax is:
          <pre>
  setenv CLASSPATH .:jmri.jar:lib/log4j.jar:lib/collections.jar:lib/crimson.jar:lib/jdom-jdk11.jar
</pre><br>
          To save typing, the "jmrithon" script is available for
          use on Linux and Mac OS X systems:
          <pre>
  % ./jmrithon
  Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
  Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  &gt;&gt;&gt; ^D
</pre><br>
          The first time you run this, you'll get a number of
          messages about "processing modified jar"; these can be
          ignored, as they are normal.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Using Jython directly</h2>This section of the page is a
      pile of useful information on controlling JMRI from Jython
      directly.

      <p>Note that you don't need most of this when running the
          PanelPro.py or similar scripts, as they handle starting a
          complete application.</p>

      <h3>Initialization</h3>JMRI uses the LogJ system extensively
      for logging information during program execution. To
      configure that when running with Jython, you should do:
      <pre>
  import org
  org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.configure("default.lcf")
</pre>before starting any of the JMRI classes. The "default.lcf" is
the name of the logging control file to be used; it can be omitted.

      <p>To make JMRI classes available, you have to do:</p>
      <pre>
  import jmri
</pre>As currently set up, this does not run any initialization
code to start the hardware connections, etc. One way to do that is
to load a configuration file, perhaps one you've created earlier
via the PanelPro preferences panel:
<pre>
  import java.io
  configfile = java.io.File(jmri.util.FileUtil.getPreferencesPath()+"PanelProConfig2.xml")
  jmri.InstanceManager.setConfigureManager(jmri.configurexml.ConfigXmlManager())
  jmri.InstanceManager.getDefault(jmri.ConfigureManager.class).load(configfile)
</pre>to activate the JMRI classes and connect to your layout
hardware. "PanelProConfig2.xml" is the name of the configuration
file from the PanelPro program; you can use another name if
desired. The configuration file controls the layout connection, and
any other options that may have been set when it was created.

<p>Alternately, if you want to start the complete PanelPro
    application, including the menu bar, spash screen, etc, you
      can do:</p>
      <pre>
 import apps
 apps.PanelPro.PanelPro.main([])
      </pre>

      <p>This will start the program, including its startup
      configuration, etc.</p>

      <p>To simplify this startup even further, you can do:</p>
      <pre>
 execfile("PanelPro.py")
      </pre>to invoke these commands.

      <h3>Access to JMRI</h3>JMRI uses the factory-pattern
      extensively to get access to objects. In Java this results in
      verbose code like
      <pre>
   Turnout t2 = InstanceManager.getDefault(jmri.TurnoutManager.class).newTurnout("LT2", "turnout 2");
   t2.setCommandedState(Turnout.THROWN)
</pre>Jython simplifies that by allowing us to provide useful
variables, and by shortening certain method calls.

      <p>To get access to the SignalHead, Sensor and Turnout
      managers and the CommandStation object, several shortcut
      variables are defined in the .py scripts listed above:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>sensors</li>

        <li>signals</li>

        <li>turnouts</li>

        <li>lights</li>

        <li>reporters</li>

        <li>memories</li>

        <li>dcc</li>

        <li>audio</li>
      </ul>These can then be referenced directly in Jython as
      <pre>
   t2 = turnouts.provideTurnout("12");
   
   dcc.
</pre>Note that the variable t2 did not need to be declared.

      <p>Juthon provides a shortcut for parameters that have been
      defined with Java-Bean-like get and set methods:</p>
      <pre>
   t2.setCommandedState(Turnout.THROWN)
</pre>can be written as
      <pre>
   t2.commandedState = THROWN
</pre>where the assignment is actually invoking the set method.
Also note that THROWN was defined when running the Python script at
startup; CLOSED, ACTIVE, INACTIVE, RED, YELLOW and GREEN are also
defined.

      <p>A similar mechanism can be used to check the state of
      something:</p>
      <pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sensors.provideSensor("3").knownState == ACTIVE 
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sensors.provideSensor("3").knownState == INACTIVE
0
</pre>Note that Jython uses "1" to indicate true, and "0" to
indicate false, so sensor 3 is currently active in this example

      <p>You can also directly invoke methods, e.g. to send a DCC
      packet to the rails you type:</p>
      <pre>
   
   dcc.sendPacket([0x01, 0x03, 0xbb], 4) 
</pre>This sends that three-byte packet four times, and then
returns to the command line.

      <p>To exit, either ^C from the command line, or use the exit
      command from the menu.</p>

      <h2>Using Python for signal logic and automation</h2>The
      existing JMRI "<a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/package-summary.html">Automat</a>"
      classes provide hooks for user layout automation, including
      signaling. But they require that you write Java code and
      compile it into .class files.

      <p>The <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/JythonAutomaton.html">
      JythonAutomaton</a> class is intended to make it easier to
      code custom layout automation, as it will allow you to invoke
      a Jython script. Once it's integrated into the configuration
      process, you'll be able to code your automation in one or
      more .py files, and have the program start running them at
      startup.</p>

      <h2>Next steps</h2>We're just learning how to best to
      integrate JMRI and Python, so there are still some basic
      mysteries.

      <h3>Initialization and modules</h3>The idea of Python
      "modules" isn't yet clearly understood. There are three ways
      to start the program via a .py file:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <pre>
  % ./jmrithon
  Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
  Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  &gt;&gt;&gt; import PanelPro
          </pre>This works, in the sense that the program starts up. But the
convenience methods are all in the PanelPro namespace:
<pre>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; turnouts.newTurnout("LT1","")
  Traceback (innermost last):
    File &amp;&lt;console&gt;&amp;, line 1, in ?
  NameError: turnouts

  &gt;&gt;&gt; PanelPro.turnouts.newTurnout("LT1","")
  jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnTurnout@36b91b
</pre>which makes for significantly more typing later. And it's
confusing, because depending on whether you started PanelPro,
DecoderPro or some other application, the names will be different.
        </li>

        <li>
          <pre>
  % ./jmrithon
  &gt;&gt;&gt;  execfile("PanelPro.py")
          </pre>or the simpler form
          <pre>
  % ./jmrithon -PanelPro.py
          </pre>This looks somewhat ugly, as it's not using the normal Python
modules technique. But the convenience methods are in the top-level
name space:
          <pre>
  turnouts.newTurnout("LT1", "")
</pre><br>
          We need to understand whether this is a real issue. Most
          Python programs don't use that top-level namespace, and
          there's probably a good reason!
        </li>
      </ol>We need to understand how the developers of Jython
      intended this to be done.

      <h3>Termination</h3>Once the JMRI main thread (or Swing GUI
      thread?) has started, ^D is not sufficient to exist the
      program. You have to select "Quit" from the actual file menu,
      or ^C the program.

      <p>It would be good to understand what's preventing the
      program from stopping when it gets the ^D.
