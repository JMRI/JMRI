      <h1>JMRI Code: Introduction to JMRI Library Structure</h1>
      
      <p>This page is the top-level introduction to how the
      JMRI software is organized.</p>
      
      <h2>Static Structure</h2>
      
        <p>At the highest level, we separate test source code from
        distributed source code by putting both in separate directories
        within the development directory: "java/test" and "java/src". This
        makes it easy to compile a version without test code, to
        apply different tools to the two types of code, etc.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to the source code, JMRI expects to find 
        directories within the current directory:
        <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/help">help/</a></dt>
            <dd>The <a href="Help.shtml">in-program help files</a></dd>
        <dt><a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/jython">jython/</a></dt>
            <dd>Various <a href="http://jmri.org/jython">sample</a> and 
                <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/test">test</a> scripts.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/lib">lib/</a></dt>
            <dd>Jar files and linkable libraries that JMRI relies on.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/resources">resources/</a></dt>
            <dd>Image and sound resources used by the library, and available for 
            user selection.  These can be 
            <a href="http://jmri.org/resources">directly browsed</a>.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/web">web/</a></dt>
            <dd>Files for JMRI's built-in web servers</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/xml">xml/</a></dt>
            <dd>XML files for decoder and programmer definitions, 
                <a href="../../tools/signaling/AspectSignaling.shtml">signal system definitions</a>,
                <a href="XmlSchema.shtml">Schema</a> and DTDs used to validate JMRI's 
                <a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">XML persistance</a>, 
                and others.
                </dd>
        </dl>
        plus specific files used by the 
        <a href="Ant.shtml">build process</a>,
        to <a href="Logging.shtml">control logging</a>,
        and containing the 
        <a href="/Copyright.shtml">JMRI license</a>.

      <h3>Static Package and Class Structure</h3>

      <p>Because
      we expect to have different interfaces in the
      <code>jmrix</code> package, the JMRI tools don't directly
      create the interface objects they need. Rather, they ask for
      instances of interfaces. For interfaces in the
      <code>jmri</code> package, which might be implemented by lots
      of different layout types, <code>jmri.InstanceManager</code>
      satisfies these requests.</p>

      <a href="images/OverallPackageStructure.png"><img src="images/OverallPackageStructure.png" align="right" height="20%" width="20%" /></a>
              (The help/en/packages section of the in-program help files are also organized this way)
              
      <p>More specifically:</p>

      <a href="images/OverallImplementationStructure.png"><img src="images/OverallImplementationStructure.png" align="right" height="20%" width="20%" /></a>
      <dl>
        <dt>jmri</dt>

        <dd>Contains interfaces and base class implementations for
        the common JMRI objects. This is the basic interface to the
        overall JMRI library and its capabilities.<br>
        Code in the jmri package should depend on no other JMRI
        code, though it may depend on externals (log4j, etc.)
        There should be no AWT or Swing code here.</dd>

        <dt>jmrit</dt>

        <dd>Contains commonly useful <strong>t</strong>ools and
        extensions.<br>
        It can depend on jmri.* and externals. It must not depend
        on jmrix.*</dd>

        <dt>jmrix</dt>

        <dd>Contains code that is specific to a particular
        e<strong>x</strong>ternal system. This includes
        implementations of jmri interfaces that are specific to a
        system, plus system-specific tools (in the long run, those
        could certainly be separated).<br>
        jmrix can depend on jmri and externals, but not jmrit.</dd>

        <dt>The jmri.jmris package</dt>

        <dd>contains all the code for the server implementation for
        the JMRI interfaces.</dd>

        <dt>managers</dt>

        <dd>Abstract and default implementations of the various
        JMRI type managers, e.g. the concrete classes from the
        InstanceManager. It's a historical accident that these have
        a package of their own, rather than being rolled into
        jmri.implementations. </dd>

        <dt>implementations</dt>

        <dd>Abstract and default implementations of the jmri
        objects; no system specific or Swing code allowed here.
        These are in a separate package, rather than in jmri
        itself, to make the jmri package simpler to understand for
        people who just want to use the library.</dd>

        <dt>util</dt>

        <dd>General service classes that are <em>not</em> user level
        tools. Should not
        depend on jmri.jmrit or jmri.jmrix packages. The
        jmri.util.swing subpackage provides Swing utilities.
        <p>
        This is an exception to the idea that packages should
        not directly reference classes across the tree: these utility
        classes are generally available for use.
        </dd>

        <dt>apps</dt>

        <dd>Separate from the jmri package tree, this contains application classes 
        and base classes that can use jmri, jmrit,
        and jmrix classes, along with anything else. By having this
        here, we break the dependency between jmrix and jmrit
        classes (somebody has to create the general and
        system-specific tool objects for an application; that
        dependency is from the apps package)</dd>



      </dl>

      Although it's not always honored, the tree structure here is important:
      Packages should <em>not</em> reference across the tree.
      Code in <code>jmri.jmrit</code> is welcome to reference classes
      in the <code>jmri</code> package, but should not reference
      directly to classes in <code>jmri.jmrix</code>. 
      Classes should reference the interfaces in <code>jmri</code>,
      not the specific details of classes in 
      <code>jmri.managers</code> and <code>jmri.implementations</code>.
      It can be tempting 
      to violate this rule in the interest of expediency, but in the
      long run it makes it much harder for JMRI to be maintained and 
      improved by a large group of people.  We just can't allow lots of 
      tiny little special cases to make the code impossible to understand.
      We're developing
      <a href="https://www.archunit.org">ArchUnit</a>
      tests for this which can be
      run via <code>./runtest.csh jmri.ArchitectureCheck</code>
      as part of
      <a href="JUnit.shtml">developer unit testing</a>.
      This will highlight many existing structure violations
      in addition to new ones
      because we haven't yet cleaned up some historical issues.
      There's also <code>jmri.ArchitectureTest</code>
      which is run as part of our
      <a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml">CI tests</a>,
      and catches new violations of a subset of the constraints.
      
      <p>
      Similarly, we have conventions for where to locate
      <a href="Swing.shtml">Swing GUI code</a> and
      <a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">persistance (store/load) code</a>
      that limits how embedded in them main code they become.
      
      <h3>Example: a Turnout</h3>
      Turnouts involve multiple classes:

      <ul>
        <li>Turnout - the basic interface. This is what you should
        expect to deal with when writing your layout automation
        code; its what you get when you make a request from the
        TurnoutManager, etc.</li>

        <li>AbstractTurnout - provided for convenience when
        implementing the Turnout interface for specific hardware,
        this provides the basic implementation.</li>

        <li>LnTurnout - a specific implementation for
        LocoNet-connected turnouts. There are many other implementations
        for different layout connections.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Dynamic (Object) Structure</h2>

      <p>For many JMRI objects, once they have been created they can 
      be accessed either by type, i.e. "The default configuration manager", or 
      by name, i.e. "The East Yard Entrance turnout".
      More information on how things (e.g. objects representing
      items on the layout) are named
      <a href="Names.shtml">is available on a separate page</a>.</p>

      <p>The 
      <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/InstanceManager.html">"InstanceManager"</a>
      as a key central point for this navigation.
        <ul>
            <li>It provides access to key objects, particularly the Managers
                that mediate access to Turnouts, Sensors, etc.
            <li>It automatically handles creation of many parts of JMRI via
                several mechanisms:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/InstanceManagerAutoDefault.html">InstanceManagerAutoDefault</a></li>
                  <li><a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/InstanceInitializer.html">InstanceInitializer</a></li>
                </ul>
                and, when needed, provides for their
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/InstanceManagerAutoInitialize.html">post-creation initialization</a>.
            </li>
            <li>It 
                <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/InstanceManager.html#dispose-jmri.Disposable-">disposes</a> 
                of 
                <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/Disposable.html">suitable objects</a>
                at the end of their lifespan when the InstanceManager (or a particular collection in it)
                is cleared.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Extensive use of Factory pattern via objects we call
      "Manager" objects.</p>

      <h3>Example: a Turnout</h3>

      <p>To get a specific Turnout instance that represents
      something on the layout, you make a request of a
      TurnoutManager. This is also an interface, with a similar
      implementation pattern. In turn, you get that TurnoutManager
      from the InstanceManager.
      
      <p>The role of the generic Manager&lt;T&gt; class
      
      <p>NamedBean and addressing as part of the Manager's role.
      <p>The role of NamedBeanHandle and the NamedBeanHandleManager.</p>
