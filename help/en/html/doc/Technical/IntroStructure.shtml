      <h1>JMRI Code: Introduction to JMRI Library Structure</h1>

      <p>This page is the top-level introduction to how the JMRI software is organized.</p>

      <h2>Static Structure</h2>

      <p>At the highest level, we separate test source code from distributed source code by putting
      both in separate directories within the development directory: "java/test" and "java/src".
      This makes it easy to compile a version without test code, to apply different tools to the
      two types of code, etc.</p>

      <p>In addition to the source code, JMRI expects to find directories within the current
      directory:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>

      <h3>Static Package and Class Structure</h3>

      <p>For interfaces in the <code>jmri</code> package, which might be implemented by lots of
      different layout hardware types, <code>jmri.InstanceManager</code> satisfies these requests
      by providing access to hardware-specific <code>Managers</code>, from which you can get the
      hardware-specific items that represent what you want to access on the layout.</p>
      <a href="images/OverallPackageStructure.png"><img src="images/OverallPackageStructure.png"
      alt="package structure"></a>
      <p>Because we have different hardware implementations in subpackages of the
      <code>jmrix</code> package, those are also accessed via the
      <code>ConnectionManager</code>classes, which provide access to generally-defined objects.</p>

      <p>Other code should, in general, not reference those specific implementations directly.</p>

      <p>(The help/en/packages section of the in-program help files are also organized this
      way)</p>

      <p>More specifically:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>jmri</dt>

        <dd>Contains interfaces and base class implementations for the common JMRI objects. This is
        the basic interface to the overall JMRI library and its capabilities.<br>
        Code in the jmri package should depend on no other JMRI code, though it may depend on
        externals (log4j, etc.) There should be no AWT or Swing code here.</dd>

        <dt>jmrit</dt>

        <dd>
          Contains commonly useful <strong>t</strong>ools and extensions.<br>
          It can depend on jmri.* and externals. It must not depend on jmrix.* <a href=
          "images/OverallImplementationStructure.png"><img src=
          "images/OverallImplementationStructure.png" alt="implementation structure"></a>
        </dd>

        <dt>jmrix</dt>

        <dd>Contains code that is specific to a particular e<strong>x</strong>ternal system. This
        includes implementations of jmri interfaces that are specific to a system, plus
        system-specific tools (in the long run, those could certainly be separated).<br>
        jmrix can depend on jmri and externals, but not jmrit.<br>
        Only system-specific code should access within the jmrix subpackages.</dd>

        <dt>jmris</dt>

        <dd>contains all the code for the server implementation for the JMRI interfaces.</dd>

        <dt>managers</dt>

        <dd>Abstract and default implementations of the various JMRI type managers, e.g. the
        concrete classes from the InstanceManager. It's a historical accident that these have a
        package of their own, rather than being rolled into jmri.implementations.</dd>

        <dt>implementations</dt>

        <dd>Abstract and default implementations of the jmri objects; no system specific or Swing
        code allowed here. These are in a separate package, rather than in jmri itself, to make the
        jmri package simpler to understand for people who just want to use the library.</dd>

        <dt>util</dt>

        <dd>
          General service classes that are <em>not</em> user level tools. Should not depend on
          jmri.jmrit or jmri.jmrix packages. The jmri.util.swing subpackage provides Swing
          utilities.
          <p>This is an exception to the idea that packages should not directly reference classes
          across the tree: these utility classes are generally available for use. <a href=
          "images/OverallAppDependencies.png"><img src="images/OverallAppDependencies.png"
          alt="dependencies"></a></p>
        </dd>

        <dt>apps</dt>

        <dd>Separate from the jmri package tree, this contains application classes and base classes
        that can use jmri, jmrit, and jmrix classes, along with anything else. By having this here,
        we break the dependency between jmrix and jmrit classes (somebody has to create the general
        and system-specific tool objects for an application; that dependency is from the apps
        package)</dd>
      </dl>
      Although it's not always honored, the tree structure here is important: Packages should
      <em>not</em> reference across the tree. Code in <code>jmri.jmrit</code> is welcome to
      reference classes in the <code>jmri</code> package, but should not reference directly to
      classes in <code>jmri.jmrix</code>. Classes should reference the interfaces in
      <code>jmri</code>, not the specific details of classes in <code>jmri.managers</code> and
      <code>jmri.implementations</code>. It can be tempting to violate this rule in the interest of
      expediency, but in the long run it makes it much harder for JMRI to be maintained and
      improved by a large group of people. We just can't allow lots of tiny little special cases to
      make the code impossible to understand. We're developing <a href=
      "https://www.archunit.org">ArchUnit</a> tests for this which can be run via
      <code>./runtest.csh jmri.ArchitectureCheck</code> as part of <a href="JUnit.shtml">developer
      unit testing</a> (there is also a PowerShell script available, see the <a href=
      "JUnit.shtml">developer unit testing</a> page for more information). This will highlight many
      existing structure violations in addition to new ones because we haven't yet cleaned up some
      historical issues. There's also <code>jmri.ArchitectureTest</code> which is run as part of
      our <a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml">CI tests</a>, and catches new violations of a
      subset of the constraints.
      <p>Similarly, we have conventions for where to locate <a href="Swing.shtml">Swing GUI
      code</a> and <a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">persistance (store/load) code</a> that limits how
      embedded in them main code they become.</p>

      <h3>Example: a Turnout</h3>
      Turnouts involve multiple classes:
      <ul>
        <li>Turnout - the basic interface. This is what you should expect to deal with when writing
        your layout automation code; its what you get when you make a request from the
        TurnoutManager, etc.</li>

        <li>AbstractTurnout - provided for convenience when implementing the Turnout interface for
        specific hardware, this provides the basic implementation.</li>

        <li>LnTurnout - a specific implementation for LocoNet-connected turnouts. There are many
        other implementations for different layout connections.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dynamic (Object) Structure</h2>

      <p>For many JMRI objects, once they have been created they can be accessed either by type,
      i.e. "The default configuration manager", or by name, i.e. "The East Yard Entrance turnout".
      More information on how things (e.g. objects representing items on the layout) are named
      <a href="Names.shtml">is available on a separate page</a>.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/InstanceManager.html">"InstanceManager"</a>
      as a key central point for this navigation.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It provides access to key objects, particularly the Managers that mediate access to
        Turnouts, Sensors, etc.</li>

        <li>It automatically handles creation of many parts of JMRI via several mechanisms:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href=
              "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/InstanceManagerAutoDefault.html">InstanceManagerAutoDefault</a>
            </li>

            <li>
              <a href=
              "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/InstanceInitializer.html">InstanceInitializer</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          and, when needed, provides for their <a href=
          "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/InstanceManagerAutoInitialize.html">post-creation
          initialization</a>.
        </li>

        <li>It <a href=
        "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/InstanceManager.html#dispose-jmri.Disposable-">disposes</a>
        of <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/Disposable.html">suitable objects</a> at the
        end of their lifespan when the InstanceManager (or a particular collection in it) is
        cleared.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Extensive use of Factory pattern via objects we call "Manager" objects.</p>

      <h3>Example: a Turnout</h3>

      <p>To get a specific Turnout instance that represents something on the layout, you make a
      request of a TurnoutManager. This is also an interface, with a similar implementation
      pattern. In turn, you get that TurnoutManager from the InstanceManager.</p>

      <p>The role of the generic Manager&lt;T&gt; class</p>

      <p>NamedBean and addressing as part of the Manager's role.</p>

      <p>The role of NamedBeanHandle and the NamedBeanHandleManager.</p>
