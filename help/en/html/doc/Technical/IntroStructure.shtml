<h1>JMRI: Introduction to JMRI Library Structure</h1>

Because we expect to have different interfaces in the <code>jmrix</code> package, 
the JMRI tools
don't directly create the interface objects they need.  
Rather, they ask for instances
of interfaces. 
For interfaces in the <code>jmri</code> package, which might be implemented by
lots of different layout types, <code>jmri.InstanceManager</code> satisfies these requests.

<P>
More information on how things (e.g. objects representing items on the layout)
are named 
<a href="Names.shtml">is available on a separate page</a>.

<p>
More specifically:

<dl>
<dt>jmri 
<dd>Contains interfaces and base class implementations
for the common JMRI objects.  This is the basic interface
to the overall JMRI library and its capabilities.<br>
Code in the jmri package 
should depend on no other JMRI code, though it may depend on
externals (log4j, etc.)

<dt>jmrit 
<dd>Contains commonly useful <strong>t</strong>ools and extensions.<br>
  It can depend on jmri.* and externals. It must not depend on jmrix.*

<dt>jmrix 
<dd>Contains code that is specific to a particular
  e<strong>x</strong>ternal system.  This includes implementations of jmri
  interfaces that are specific to a system, plus system-specific
  tools (in the long run, those could certainly be separated).<br>
  jmrix can depend on jmri and externals, but not jmrit.

<dt>util
<dd>General service classes that are _not_ user level tools.  

<dt>managers
<dd>Abstract and default implementations of the various 
JMRI type managers, e.g. the concrete classes from the InstanceManager.
It's a historical accident that these have a package of their own,
rather than being rolled into jmri.implementations.

<dt>implementations
<dd>Abstract and default implementations of the jmri objects;
no system specific or Swing code allowed here.
These are in a separate package, rather than in jmri itself,
to make the jmri package simpler to understand for people
who just want to use the library.

<dt>apps 
<dd>Contains application bases that can use jmri, jmrit, and
  jmrix classes, along with anything else.  
  By having this here, we break the dependency
  between jmrix and jmrit classes (somebody has to create the
  general and system-specific tool objects for an application;
  that dependency is from the apps package)
</dl>

Basically:
<pre>

      apps   ->   jmri

                  A  A
                 /    \
                /      \
              jmrix     jmrit

</pre>
(This should show apps using jmrit and jmrix also, but that's too hard to draw in ASCII)

<p>
Extensive use of Factory pattern via objects we call "Manager" objects.

<h3>Example: a Turnout</h3>
Turnouts involve:
<ul>
<li>Turnout - the basic interface. This is what you should expect to deal with
 				when writing your layout automation code; its what you get 
 				when you make a request from the TurnoutManager, etc.
<li>AbstractTurnout - provided for convenience when implementing the Turnout interface
				for specific hardware, this provides the basic implementation.
<li>LnTurnout - a specific implementation for LocoNet-connected turnouts.
</ul>

<p>
To get a specific Turnout instance that represents something on the layout, you
make a request of a TurnoutManager.  This is also an interface, with a similar
implementation pattern.
