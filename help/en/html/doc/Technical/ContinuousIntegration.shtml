      <h1>JMRI Code: Continuous Integration</h1>

      <p>"Continuous Integration" is the process of rebuilding a
      system every time it changes, so that you rapidly learn of
      new problems and are motivated to remove existing ones.</p>

      <p>The core of our system is a series of <a href=
      "#jenkins">Jenkins</a> jobs that routinely build the code,
      run checks, and creates downloadable installers. That means
      that we can and do put changes into our users hands very
      quickly. There's a <a href="CI-status.shtml">CI status
      page</a> that shows the combined status of that.</p>

      <p>We divide these into three groups:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#mandatory">Mandatory checks</a> that must be
        OK before the change will be merged.</li>

        <li><a href="#optional">Optional checks</a> that provide
        additional information on the code. These don't have to be
        completely cleared before a change is merged, but their
        observations should be considered and their metrics should
        be improving.</li>

        <li><a href="#independent">Independent checks</a> that are
        run by our <a href="#jenkins">Jenkins instance</a> on a
        periodic basis to look for deeper problems.</li>
      </ul><a name="mandatory" id="mandatory"></a>

      <h2>Mandatory Checks</h2>We use three CI engines to test
      every proposed change entered into our GitHub code repository
      before it gets merged.

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#travis">Travis</a></li>

        <li><a href="#actions">GitHub Actions</a></li>

        <li><a href="#wip">WIP check</a></li>
      </ul><a name="travis" id="travis"></a>

      <h3>Travis CI</h3>
      <p>We use <a href=
      "https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> to do integration/test
      builds on Linux for every pull into our main <a href=
      "http://github.com/JMRI">GitHub</a> repositories.</p>

      <p>Travis will build any branch that contains a .travis.yml
      file. The build history for the main JMRI repository is at
      <a href=
      "https://travis-ci.org/JMRI/JMRI">https://travis-ci.org/JMRI/JMRI</a>.</p>

      <p>Travis normally runs several jobs in parallel:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The "graphical" one, which just runs AllTest with
        schema checks and intermittent tests disabled to reduce
        runtime; this also does coverage checks. A screen buffer
        (not a real screen) is used for all the GUI tests.</li>

        <li>The "static" one, which runs various static code checks
        such as he checks for valid line-ends, the check for proper
        ASCII characters, SpotBugs, etc,</li>

        <li>The "headless" one, which runs HeadlessTest with schema
        tests enabled</li>

        <li>And one that separately and individual runs the tests
        that are marked as requiring separate runnning.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can enable Travis CI for your fork (personal GitHub
      repository) as well. After merging JMRI/master into your own
      fork, allow Travis CI to monitor your fork, and it will begin
      testing after your next push to GitHub. Follow the
      instructions at <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis
      CI</a> to set up your forks.</p>

      <p>You can prevent a Travis CI from running against a
      specific commit by including "[ci skip]" (including the
      brackets, but not the quotes) anywhere in the commit message
      if so desired.</p>

      <p>Travis is controlled by the .travis.yml file. Much of the
      work is done by the scripts/travis.sh script. </p>

      <h3>GitHub Actions</h3>We use <a href=
      "https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> to
      do two things on every pull into our main <a href=
      "http://github.com/JMRI">GitHub</a> repositories. <a href=
      "images/ActionSettings.png"><img src=
      "images/ActionSettings.png" align="right" width="331" height=
      "167"></a>

      <ul>
        <li>Run a series of static checks: Run Spotbugs and the
        compiler warning checks, make sure Javadocs build cleanly,
        etc.</li>

        <li>Run the JUnit tests on a Windows machine.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These checks are defined by files in the
      .github/workflows/ directory.</p>

      <p>These normally run both on PRs to the main JMRI/JMRI
      repository, but also on pushes and PRs to your own
      repository. If you want to turn that off,</p>

      <ol>
        <li>On the page for your own repository, select
        "Settings"</li>

        <li>From the left sidebar, select "Actions"</li>

        <li>Pick on option for what can run. The bottom option
        turns everything off for you locally.</li>
      </ol>
      Note that if you turn this off, the "Actions"
      tab won't show in the GitHub web interface until
      you turn it back on.
      

      <a name="wip" id="wip"></a>
      <h3>WIP</h3>
      <p>We use the <a href=
      "https://github.com/apps/wip">WIP check</a> to allow somebody
      to mark a PR as "Work in Progress" (WIP) by putting WIP in
      the title line. The PR will then not be merged until the WIP
      is removed. 

      <a name="optional" id="optional"></a>
      <h2>Optional Checks</h2>
      
      <p>We also run some advisory checkers.
      Although we don't require that they pass, we strongly
      recommend that people look at them and try to improve their
      metrics of test coverage, simplicity and understandability,
      etc.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#coveralls">Coveralls</a></li>

        <li><a href="#codeclimate">CodeClimate</a></li>
      </ul>
            
      <a name="coveralls" id="coveralls"></a>
      <h3>Coveralls</h3>The <a href=
      "https://coveralls.io/github/JMRI">Coveralls check</a> does a
      deep check of which parts of the code were run during the
      test steps, and which were left uncovered. This can be very
      useful information when writing tests to make sure your code
      is working properly. In general, you should try to increase
      the code coverage, even if just a bit, with every PR.
      <a name="CodeClimate" id="CodeClimate"></a>

      <h3>Code Climate</h3>The <a href=
      "https://codeclimate.com/github/JMRI/JMRI/">Code Climate</a>
      points out places where the code appears to be complex in
      various ways. (It also provides coverage information, though
      <a href="#coveralls">Coveralls</a> seems to do a better job
      of that.) We recommend you look at those results and make
      updates where they make sense, so that things are
      continuously improving, but not every suggestion it makes is
      worth it, or even appropriate. We don't require this to be
      clean before merging.

      <p>Code Climate is controlled by the .codeclimate.yml file.
      <a name="independent" id="independent"></a></p>

      <h2>Independent Checks with Jenkins</h2>JMRI uses the
      <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> continuous
      integration engine for integration and test builds. This
      includes keeping our <a href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a> up
      to date as changes are committed, building installer packages
      from development builds, and building final releases.

      <p>Our primary Jenkins engine is at <a href=
      "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/">https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/</a>.
      Because it's hosted outside the US, we force its Java locale
      to US English by setting the <code>LC_ALL</code> environment
      variable to <code>en_US</code> in the master Jenkins
      configuration settings. 
      <!-- We previously had an engine at <a href=
      "https://jmri.ci.cloudbees.com">https://jmri.ci.cloudbees.com</a>.
      but that's now inactive -->
       <a name="jenkins" id="jenkins"></a></p>

      <p>Specific Jenkins results of interest:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href=
        "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Builds/">
        Builds</a> page, showing status of the builds done after
        every series of commits. Successful builds are followed by
        builds installers via the <a href=
        "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages">
        Packages</a> job.</li>

        <li>
          <a href=
          "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/SpotBugs/">
          SpotBugs</a> page, showing status of the more-extensive
          <a href="SpotBugs.shtml">SpotBugs</a> tests done
          periodically. There are also pages of the <a href=
          "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/SpotBugs/changes">
          most recent changes</a> and the <a href=
          "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/SpotBugs/lastBuild/">
          most recent results</a>.

          <p>For more information on JMRI's use of SpotBugs, see
          the <a href="SpotBugs.shtml">separate SpotBugs
          page</a>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Jenkins Integration with NetBeans</h3>

      <p>If you are developing in the <a href=
      "NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans 7.0</a> environment, it is possible
      to integrate feedback from the Jenkins Continuous Integration
      (CI) engine.</p>

      <p>Within the NetBeans environment, reference is made to the
      Hudson CI engine - Jenkins is a <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">"fork"</a>
      of the Hudson code and supports the same <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a>.</p>

      <p>Integration into NetBeans is achieved by executing the
      following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Open NetBeans</li>

        <li>Switch to the 'Services' window (shortcut key
        'Ctrl+5')</li>

        <li>Right-click (Ctrl-click on Mac) the entry 'Hudson
        Builders' and choose 'Add Hudson Instance...'

          <p><img src="images/NetBeansJenkinsAdd.png" width="342"
          height="134" alt="Add Hudson Instance..."></p>
        </li>

        <li>In the resulting pop-up, complete the following:

          <dl>
            <dt>Name</dt>

            <dd>JMRI</dd>

            <dt>URL</dt>

            <dd>https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/</dd>

            <dt>Auto refresh every X minutes</dt>

            <dd>60 (change from the default of 5 to avoid
            overloading the CI server)</dd>
          </dl><img src="images/NetBeansJenkinsAddDialog.png"
          width="453" height="240" alt=
          "Add Hudson Instance dialog">
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>From now on, the current status of the Jenkins builds can
      be reviewed in the 'Services' window by expanding the 'JMRI'
      entry under 'Hudson Builders'.</p>
