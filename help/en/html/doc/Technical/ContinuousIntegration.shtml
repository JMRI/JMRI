      <h1>JMRI Code: Continuous Integration</h1>

      <p>"Continuous Integration" is the process of rebuilding a system every time it changes, so
      that you rapidly learn of new problems and are motivated to remove existing ones.</p>

      <p>The core of our system is a series of
      <a href="#mandatory">GitHub Actions</a> and
      <a href="#jenkins">Jenkins</a> jobs that routinely
      build the code, run checks, and creates downloadable installers. That means that we can and
      do put changes into our users hands very quickly. There's a <a href="CI-status.shtml">CI
      status page</a> that shows the combined status of that.</p>

      <p>We divide these into three groups:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#mandatory">Mandatory checks</a> that must be OK before the change will be
          merged.
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#optional">Optional checks</a> that provide additional information on the code.
          These don't have to be completely cleared before a change is merged, but their
          observations should be considered and their metrics should be improving.
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#independent">Independent checks</a> that are run by our <a href=
          "#jenkins">Jenkins instance</a> on a periodic basis to look for deeper problems.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="mandatory">Mandatory Checks</h2>
      <p>We use multiple
      <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub actions</a>
      to test every proposed change entered into our GitHub code repository
      before it gets merged.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#winCI">Windows CI tests</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#headless">Headless Tests</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#separate">Separate Tests</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#static">Static Analysis</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#process">Process steps</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These checks are defined by files in the <code>.github/</code> directory.</p>

      <p>They normally run both on PRs to the main <code>JMRI/JMRI</code> repository,
      but also on pushes and PRs to your own repository.</p>

      <p>If you want to turn that off,</p>
      <a href="images/ActionSettings.png"><img src="images/ActionSettings.png"
      class="floatRight" alt="github actions"></a>

      <ol>
        <li>On the page for your own repository, select "Settings"</li>

        <li>From the left sidebar, select "Actions"</li>

        <li>Pick on option for what can run. The bottom option turns everything off for you
        locally.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Note that if you turn this off, the "Actions" tab won't show in the GitHub web interface
        until you turn it back on.</p>

      <h3 id="winCI">Windows CI tests</h3>
        <p>This runs "AllTest", our test suite of over 30,000
        <a href="JUnit.shtml">JUnit tests</a> on a Windows server. A screen buffer (not a real
        screen) is used for all the GUI tests. All tests must pass.</p>

      <h3 id="headless">Headless tests</h3>
        <p>Reruns the JUnit test suite in "java.awt.Headless=true" mode to ensure that
        the parts of JMRI that are meant to run without a GUI really can. This is about 80%
        of the test suite. These are run on Linux. All tests must pass.</p>

      <h3 id="separate">Separate tests</h3>
        <p>About a hundred JUnit graphical tests are run separately from AllTest
        to ensure they have a clean environment. These are run on Linux. All tests must pass.</p>

      <h3 id="static">Static analysis</h3>
      <p>This runs a series of static analysis checks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A pass of the ECJ compiler with warnings on
            <li><a href="SpotBugs.shtml">Spotbugs</a>
            <li>CheckStyle
            <li>A Javadoc generation and check
            <li>A scan of the help files with htmllint
            <li>And a set of architecture checks of interpackage references, etc.
        </ul>
      <p>Any errors or warnings fail this step.</p>

      <h3 id="process">Process steps</h3>
      <p>There are a few additional actions that are used as process controls:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Checks consistency of TypeScript and Javascript files.
            <li>Set flags that represent whether a PR might need localization,
                and whether it contains updated help files.
            <li>If needed, reminds the author to add to the release note
            <li>Prevent PRs marked "WIP" (Work In Progress) from <a href="https://github.com/apps/wip">being merged</a>
            <li>Require that PRs be approved by a 2nd party before being merged
            <li>And enforce a 24-hour waiting period so that the world-wide team
                can get a look at the PR.
        </ul>

      <h2 id="optional">Optional Checks</h2>

      <p>We also run advisory checks on every pull request (PR). Although we don't require that they
      have zero warnings, we strongly
      recommend that people look at them and try to improve their metrics of test coverage,
      simplicity and understandability, etc.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#codeclimate">CodeClimate</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="CodeClimate">Code Climate</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/JMRI/JMRI/">Code Climate</a> points out places
      where the code appears to be complex in various ways. (It also provides coverage information,
      though <a href="#jacoco">JaCoCo</a> seems to do a better job of that.) We recommend you
      look at those results and make updates where they make sense, so that things are continuously
      improving, but not every suggestion it makes is worth it, or even appropriate. We don't
      require this to be clean before merging.</p>

      <p>Code Climate is controlled by the .codeclimate.yml file.</p>

      <h2 id="independent">Independent Checks with Jenkins</h2>
      <p>JMRI uses the <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> continuous integration engine for
      integration and test builds. This includes keeping our <a href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a>
      up to date as changes are committed, building installer packages from development builds, and
      building final releases.</p>

      <p>Our primary Jenkins engine is at <a href=
      "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/">https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/</a>. Because it's hosted
      outside the US, we force its Java locale to US English by setting the <code>LC_ALL</code>
      environment variable to <code>en_US</code> in the master Jenkins configuration settings.</p>

      <p id="jenkins">Specific Jenkins results of interest:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/builds/">Builds</a> page,
          showing status of the builds done after every series of commits. Successful builds are
          followed by building installers via the <a href=
          "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages">Packages</a> job.
          These are sometimes referred to as "development builds".
        </li>

        <li id="jacoco">
            <a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/jacoco/">JaCoCo</a> page,
            showing test coverage from our JUnit tests.  There's both a summary of overall
            coverage, and detailed information on each
            <a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/jacoco/lastBuild/jacoco/jmri.implementation/">class</a> and
            <a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/jacoco/lastBuild/jacoco/jmri.implementation/AbstractAudio/">method</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/spotbugs/">SpotBugs</a>
          page, showing status of the more-extensive <a href="SpotBugs.shtml">SpotBugs</a> tests
          done periodically. There are also pages of the <a href=
          "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/spotbugs/changes">most recent
          changes</a> and the <a href=
          "https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/spotbugs/lastBuild/">most recent
          results</a>.
          <p>For more information on JMRI's use of SpotBugs, see the <a href=
          "SpotBugs.shtml">separate SpotBugs page</a>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Jenkins Integration with NetBeans</h3>

      <p>If you are developing in the <a href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans 7.0</a> environment, it is
      possible to integrate feedback from the Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) engine.</p>

      <p>Within the NetBeans environment, reference is made to the Hudson CI engine - Jenkins is a
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">"fork"</a> of the Hudson
      code and supports the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a>.</p>

      <p>Integration into NetBeans is achieved by executing the following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Open NetBeans</li>

        <li>Switch to the 'Services' window (shortcut key 'Ctrl+5')</li>

        <li>Right-click (Ctrl-click on Mac) the entry 'Hudson Builders' and choose 'Add Hudson
        Instance...'
          <p><img src="images/NetBeansJenkinsAdd.png" alt="Add Hudson Instance...">
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>In the resulting pop-up, complete the following:
          <dl>
            <dt>Name</dt>

            <dd>JMRI</dd>

            <dt>URL</dt>

            <dd>https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/</dd>

            <dt>Auto refresh every X minutes</dt>

            <dd>60 (change from the default of 5 to avoid overloading the CI server)</dd>
          </dl>
          <img src="images/NetBeansJenkinsAddDialog.png" alt="Add Hudson Instance dialog">
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>From now on, the current status of the Jenkins builds can be reviewed in the 'Services'
      window by expanding the 'JMRI' entry under 'Hudson Builders'.</p>
