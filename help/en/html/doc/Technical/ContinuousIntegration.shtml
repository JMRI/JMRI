      <h1>JMRI: Continuous Integration</h1>"Continuous Integration"
      is the process of rebuilding a system every time it changes,
      so that you rapidly learn of new problems and are motivated
      to remove existing ones.

      <p>The core of our system is a series of <a href=
      "#jenkins">Jenkins</a> jobs that routinely build the code,
      run checks, and creates downloadable installers. That means
      that we can and do put changes into our users hands very
      quickly.</p>

      <p>We also use two additioanl CI engines to test every change
      entered into our GitHub code repository.</p>

      <h2>Travis CI</h2>We use <a href=
      "https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> to do integration/test
      builds on Linux for every pull into our main <a href=
      "http://github.com/JMRI">GitHub</a> repositories.

      <p>Travis will build any branch that contains a .travis.yml
      file. The build history for the main JMRI repository is at
      <a href=
      "https://travis-ci.org/JMRI/JMRI">https://travis-ci.org/JMRI/JMRI</a>.</p>

      <p>Travis normally runs the checks for valid line-ends, the
      check for proper ASCII characters, followed by building the
      code and running the "AllTest" test routine. A screen buffer
      (not a real screen) is used for all the GUI tests.</p>

      <p>You can enable Travis CI for your fork (personal GitHub
      repository) as well. After merging JMRI/master into your own
      fork, allow Travis CI to monitor your fork, and it will begin
      testing after your next push to GitHub. Follow the
      instructions at <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis
      CI</a> to set up your forks.</p>

      <p>You can prevent a Travis CI from running against a
      specific commit by including "[ci skip]" (including the
      brackets, but not the quotes) anywhere in the commit message
      if so desired.</p>

      <h2>AppVeyor CI</h2>We use <a href=
      "http://www.appveyor.com">AppVeyor CI</a> to do
      integration/test builds on Windows for every pull into our
      main <a href="http://github.com/JMRI">GitHub</a>
      repositories.

      <p>AppVeyor will build any branch that contains a
      appveyor.yml file. The build history for the main JMRI
      repository is at <a href=
      "https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JMRI/jmri">https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JMRI/jmri</a>.</p>

      <p>AppVeyor normally runs the property-files checks (for
      duplicate targets and other errors), followed by building the
      code and running the "AllTest" test routine. A screen buffer
      (not a real screen) is used for all the GUI tests.</p>

      <p>Although it is possible to enable AppVeyor to build
      commits to your own fork of the JMRI repositories, it's a bit
      complicated to do it within the AppVeyor security model.</p>

      <h2 id="jenkins">Jenkins</h2>JMRI uses the <a href=
      "http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> continuous integration
      engine for integration and test builds. This includes keeping
      our <a href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a> up to date as
      changes are committed, building installer packages from
      development builds, and building final releases.

      <p>Our primary Jenkins engine is at <a href=
      "http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/">http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/</a>,
      also known as <a href=
      "http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/">http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/</a>.
      
      <!-- We previously had an engine at <a href=
      "https://jmri.ci.cloudbees.com">https://jmri.ci.cloudbees.com</a>.
      but that's now inactive -->

      <p>Specific Jenkins results of interest:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href=
        "http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Builds/">
        Builds</a> page, showing status of the builds done after
        every series of commits. Successful builds are followed by
        builds installers via the <a href=
        "http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/view/All/job/Development/job/Packages">
        Packages</a> job.</li>

        <li>
          <a href=
          "http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Findbugs/">
          FindBugs</a> page, showing status of the more-extensive
          <a href="FindBugs.shtml">FindBugs</a> tests done
          periodically. There are also pages of the <a href=
          "http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Findbugs/changes">
          most recent changes</a> and the <a href=
          "http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Findbugs/lastBuild/">
          most recent results</a>.

          <p>For more information on JMRI's use of FindBugs, see
          the <a href="FindBugs.shtml">separate FindBugs
          page</a>.</p>

      </ul>

      <h3>Jenkins Integration with NetBeans</h3>

      <p>If you are developing in the <a href=
      "NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans 7.0</a> environment, it is possible
      to integrate feedback from the Jenkins Continuous Integration
      (CI) engine.</p>

      <p>Within the NetBeans environment, reference is made to the
      Hudson CI engine - Jenkins is a <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">"fork"</a>
      of the Hudson code and supports the same <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a>.</p>

      <h3>Integration</h3>

      <p>Integration into NetBeans is achieved by executing the
      following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Open NetBeans</li>

        <li>Switch to the 'Services' window (shortcut key
        'Ctrl+5')</li>

        <li>Right-click (Ctrl-click on Mac) the entry 'Hudson
        Builders' and choose 'Add Hudson Instance...'

          <p><img src="images/NetBeansJenkinsAdd.png" width="342"
          height="134" alt="Add Hudson Instance..."></p>
        </li>

        <li>In the resulting pop-up, complete the following:

          <dl>
            <dt>Name</dt>

            <dd>JMRI</dd>

            <dt>URL</dt>

            <dd>http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/</dd>

            <dt>Auto refresh every X minutes</dt>

            <dd>60 (change from the default of 5 to avoid
            overloading the CI server)</dd>
          </dl><img src="images/NetBeansJenkinsAddDialog.png"
          width="453" height="240" alt=
          "Add Hudson Instance dialog">
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>From now on, the current status of the Jenkins builds can
      be reviewed in the 'Services' window by expanding the 'JMRI'
      entry under 'Hudson Builders'.</p>
