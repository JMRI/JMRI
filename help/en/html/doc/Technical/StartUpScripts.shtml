<H1>JMRI Startup Scripts</H1>

Although JMRI itself is constructed to "run anywhere",
starting a JMRI application requires commands that are
specific to the particular type of computer used.
With each JMRI distribution, we provide 
scripts, application bundles or batch files that
handle the details for you. 
Of course, you can modify these or create your own.
<p>
This page provides information on the tools provided with
JMRI distributions on:
<ul>
<li><a href="#linux">Linux</a>
<li><a href="#macosx">MacOS X</a>
<li><a href="#windows">Windows</a>
</ul>

If you update any of these, please consider either 
making your change on the other machines (and testing it!)
or at least putting a comment in the others
to describe how they now differ.

<a id="linux">
<h2>Linux</h2></a>

JMRI distributions for Linux contain shell (bash) scripts
for each of the main applications:  DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc.
These are all structured the same way.

<h3>Details</h3>

In this section, we briefly describe what each section of the script does.
<dl>
<dt>CLASSNAME
<dd>To make the script easier to maintain, the name of the main
class is defined near the beginning.

<dt>Debug setting
<dd>
If the DEBUG symbol is set to anything, the script will produce
debugging output after each section.

<dt>Directory
<dd>
To run, JMRI needs to be able to find things in the current directory.
This step attempts to set that directory automatically.
<p>
If the JMRI_HOME environment variable is defined
and pointing to a directory that contains a jmri.jar file,
change the current directory to there.
<p>
Otherwise, change the current directory to where the script file
is located.

<dt>Classpath
<dd>
The script builds the Java classpath automatically to contain,
in order:
<ul>
<li>class files in the current directory
<li>class files in the class subdirectory of the current directory
<li>class files in the java/class subdirectory of the current directory
<li>all jar files in the current directory, except jmri.jar
<li>jmri.jar in the current directory
<li>all jar files in the lib subdirectory of the current directory
</ul>
<p>
This allows you to drop jar files into the 
JMRI install directory for the 
<a href="../help/en/html/doc/Technical/plugins.shtml">JMRI plug-in mechanism</a>.

<dt>Configuration File
<dd>
If there's an argument to the script, it will be used as the name of the preferences
file used to configure the program at startup.  If the user saves the preferences
from the program, they'll go to this file too.
<p>
If no argument is provided, the configuration file name is made 
from the name of the script, followed by "Config2.xml".  For example,
the DecoderPro script uses DecoderProConfig2.xml as a preferences file.
If a copy of that script is named MyJmriApp, it will use a preferences 
file named MyJmriAppConfig2.xml. 
<p>
This lets you create as many specialized configurations you'd like by just
copying and renaming a startup script.

<dt>Java options
<dd>
The program sets a number of options for the JVM.  This includes
the necessary program settings, setting memory limits, and various
symbols to control operation.

<p>
We also set some options here that are only used
on MacOS X.  
This lets people use the the Linux scripts on MacOS X if they'd
prefer shell scripts to application bundles.

<dt>Alternate port names
<dd>
RXTX does not know about certain names for serial ports connected
via USB.  This section looks for a few known names and adds them
to the program if present.

<dt>Java command
<dd>Finally, the script puts all this together into a java command, which it executes.

</dl>

<a id="macosx">
<h2>MacOS X</h2></a>
JMRI distributions for MacOS X contain application bundles
for each of the main applications:  DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc.
These provide familiar application icons for the user.

<p>
To register the bundles with MacOS X, they need to be copied
from the distributed disk image onto the user's disk drive.

<h3>Bundle Details</h3>

JMRI has registered four application signatures: 
<dl>
<dt>JMRD<dd>DecoderPro
<dt>JMRP<dd>PanelPro
<dt>JMRI<dd>JmriDemo
<dt>JMRL<dd>LocoTools
<dt>JMRC<dd>Cornwall demo
</dl>

<h3>Script Details</h3>

Each bundle as a startup shell (Bash) script in the Contents/MacOSX
directory what does the actual startup.
In this section, we briefly describe what each section of that script does.
<dl>
<dt>CLASSNAME
<dd>To make the script easier to maintain, the name of the main
class is defined near the beginning.

<dt>Debug setting
<dd>
If the DEBUG symbol is set to anything, the script will produce
debugging output after each section.

<dt>Directory
<dd>
To run, JMRI needs to be able to find things in the current directory.
This step attempts to set that directory automatically.
<p>
If the JMRI_HOME environment variable is defined
and pointing to a directory that contains a jmri.jar file,
change the current directory to there.
<p>
Otherwise, change the current directory to where the application bundle
is located.

<dt>Classpath
<dd>
The script builds the Java classpath automatically to contain,
in order:
<ul>
<li>class files in the current directory
<li>class files in the class subdirectory of the current directory
<li>class files in the java/class subdirectory of the current directory
<li>all jar files in the current directory, except jmri.jar
<li>jmri.jar in the current directory
<li>all jar files in the lib subdirectory of the current directory
</ul>
<p>
This allows you to drop jar files into the 
JMRI install directory for the 
<a href="../help/en/html/doc/Technical/plugins.shtml">JMRI plug-in mechanism</a>.

<dt>Configuration File
<dd>
The configuration file name is made 
from the name of the application bundle, followed by "Config2.xml".  For example,
the DecoderPro application uses DecoderProConfig2.xml as a preferences file.
If a copy of that application is named MyJmriApp, it will use a preferences 
file named MyJmriAppConfig2.xml. 
<p>
This lets you create as many specialized configurations you'd like by just
copying and renaming an application.

<dt>Java options
<dd>
The program sets a number of options for the JVM.  This includes
the necessary program settings, setting memory limits, various
symbols to control operation, and some options specific to MacOS X.

<dt>Java command
<dd>Finally, the script puts all this together into a java command, which it executes.

</dl>


<a id="windows">
<h2>Windows</h2></a>

Currently, the Windows .bat files 
just create a fixed java command and execute it.
<p>
It would be good if somebody improved these.

(This section needs information on how icons and shortcuts work.
The InstallerVISE installer does something to associate an icon
and to put two shortcuts on the desktop)
