<H1>JMRI Startup Scripts</H1>

Although JMRI itself is constructed to "run anywhere",
starting a JMRI application requires commands that are
specific to the particular type of computer used.
With each JMRI distribution, we provide
scripts, application bundles or batch files that
handle the details for you.
Of course, you can modify these or create your own.
<p>
This page provides information on the tools provided with
JMRI distributions on:
<ul>
<li><a href="#linux">Linux</a>
<li><a href="#macosx">Mac OS X</a>
<li><a href="#windows">Windows</a>
</ul>

If you update any of these, please consider either
making your change on the other machines (and testing it!)
or at least putting a comment in the others
to describe how they now differ.

<p>
During startup, JMRI gets additional information from several sources:
<ul>
<li>If present, a "python.properties" file configures the Jython interpreter environment
<li>JMRI's own <a href="../../profiles.shtml">profiles and configuration information</a>.
</ul>

<a name="linux">
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2></a>

JMRI distributions for Linux contain shell (bash) scripts
for each of the main applications:  DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc.
These are all structured the same way.

<h3>Details</h3>

In this section, we briefly describe what each section of the script does.
<dl>
<dt>CLASSNAME
<dd>To make the script easier to maintain, the name of the main
class is defined near the beginning.

<dt>Debug setting
<dd>
If the DEBUG symbol is set to anything, the script will produce
debugging output after each section.

<dt>Directory
<dd>
To run, JMRI needs to be able to find things in the current directory.
This step attempts to set that directory automatically.
<p>
If the JMRI_HOME environment variable is defined
and pointing to a directory that contains a jmri.jar file,
change the current directory to there.
<p>
Otherwise, change the current directory to where the script file
is located.

<dt>Library Files
<dd>
The RXTX Serial library requires some platform specific native libraries
in order to interface to the serial port drivers.  JMRI applications need
to use the version of the library that is correct for the operating system
and the CPU architecture.
<p>
The two most common architectures at this time are <tt>i386</tt> and <tt>x86_64</tt>,
respectively the 32 bit Intel and the 64 bit AMD/Intel systems.
<p>
The startup scripts will use some common applications (<tt>arch</tt>, <tt>uname</tt>)
to determine the current operating system and architecture, and then set up the
correct library paths for Java to find the right shared library files.

<dt>Classpath
<dd>
The script builds the Java classpath automatically to contain,
in order:
<ul>
<li>class files in the current directory
<li>class files in the class subdirectory of the current directory
<li>class files in the java/class subdirectory of the current directory
<li>all jar files in the current directory, except jmri.jar
<li>jmri.jar in the current directory
<li>all jar files in the lib subdirectory of the current directory
</ul>
<p>
This allows you to drop jar files into the
JMRI install directory for the
<a href="plugins.shtml">JMRI plug-in mechanism</a>.

<dt>Configuration File
<dd>
If there's an argument to the script, it will be used as the name of the preferences
file used to configure the program at startup.  If the user saves the preferences
from the program, they'll go to this file too.
<p>
If no argument is provided, the configuration file name is made
from the name of the script, followed by "Config2.xml".  For example,
the DecoderPro script uses DecoderProConfig2.xml as a preferences file.
If a copy of that script is named MyJmriApp, it will use a preferences
file named MyJmriAppConfig2.xml.
<p>
This lets you create as many specialized configurations you'd like by just
copying and renaming a startup script.

<dt>Java options
<dd>
The program sets a number of options for the JVM.  This includes
the necessary program settings, setting memory limits, and various
symbols to control operation.

<dt>Alternate port names
<dd>
RXTX does not know about certain names for serial ports connected
via USB.  This section looks for a few known names and adds them
to the program if present.  If you have a device file name that JMRI
cannot find, you can set the environment variable <tt>JMRI_SERIAL_PORTS</tt>
to be comma-separated list of the names.

<dt>Java command
<dd>Finally, the script puts all this together into a java command, which it executes.

</dl>

<a name="macosx">
<h2>Mac OS X</h2></a>
JMRI distributions for Mac OS X contain application bundles
for each of the main applications:  DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc.
These provide familiar application icons for the user.

<p>
To register the bundles with Mac OS X, they need to be copied
from the distributed disk image onto the user's disk drive.

<h3>Bundle Details</h3>

JMRI has registered five application signatures:
<dl>
<dt>JMRD<dd>DecoderPro
<dt>JMRP<dd>PanelPro
<dt>JMRI<dd>(generic JMRI, was JMRIdemo)
<dt>JMRL<dd>LocoTools (no longer used)
<dt>JMRC<dd>Cornwall demo (no longer used)
</dl>

<h3>Script Details</h3>

Each bundle has a startup shell (Bash) script in the Contents/MacOSX
directory what does the actual startup.
This is the same script as used for Linux,
see please see <a href="#linux">that section</a>
for details.

</dl>


<a name="windows">
<h2>Windows</h2></a>

Upto and including JMRI version 2.3.2, the Windows .bat files just create a fixed java command and executed it.
<p>From JMRI version 2.3.3, the individual Windows .bat files now call a small launcher application, LaunchJMRI.exe.

<h3>Command-line details</h3>

In this section, we briefly describe the launcher application command-line options and parameters.
<dl>
<dt>/debug (Optional - from JMRI 2.5.1)
<dd>If this option is set on the command line, a window is opened that displays various useful information for debugging purposes.
<dt>/noisy (Optional - from JMRI 2.5.1)
<dd>If this option is set on the command line, the launcher does not attempt to minimise the Java Console window - as from JMRI 2.5.1, the default behaviour is to minimise the Java Console window.
<br>Starting with JMRI 2.11.1, the behaviour of this option has changed - this now determines if the Java Console window is enabled or not. System messages are now available via the 'Help > System Console ...' menu option in the main JMRI window.
<dt>/32bit (Optional - from JMRI 2.99.4)
<dd>If this option is set on the command line, the launcher will force the use of a 32-bit Java Runtime Environment on 64-bit machines.
    This option has no effect on 32-bit machines.
<dt>/profile &lt;profileID&gt; (Optional - from JMRI 3.7.1)
<dd>If this option is set on the command line, the launcher will use profile &lt;profileID&gt; as the <a href="/help/en/html/profiles.shtml">JMRI configuration profile</a> to use instead of the default one.
<dt>Class Parameter
<dd>The first parameter of LaunchJMRI.exe, after any of the above options, is the name of the main class to execute.
<dd>An example to launch DecoderPro would be "apps.DecoderPro.DecoderPro"

<dt>Configuration File Parameter (Optional)
<dd>
If there's a second argument to the launcher, it will be used as the name of the preferences file used to configure the program at startup.  If the user saves the preferences from the program, they'll go to this file too.
<br>
If no argument is provided, the configuration file name is defaulted in the application.  For example, the DecoderPro application uses DecoderProConfig2.xml as a preferences file.  If the launcher is called by 'LaunchJMRI.exe apps.DecoderPro.DecoderPro MyJmriAppConfig2.xml', it will use a preferences file named MyJmriAppConfig2.xml.
<br>
This allows you to create as many specialized configurations you'd like by creating a new Start Menu and/or Desktop shortcut to 'LaunchJMRI.exe' file and adding the preferences file as a parameter.
</dl>

<h3>Environment variables</h3>

As from JMRI version 2.11.4, it is possible to influence the settings used to launch JMRI via the use of Environment Variables.

The Environment Variables used are:

<dl>
<dt>JMRI_HOME
<dd>This determines the program location
<dt>JMRI_OPTIONS
<dd>This specifies additional JVM options
<dt>JMRI_PREFSDIR
<dd>This specifies the location of an alternative preferences directory
<dt>JMRI_USERHOME
<dd>This specifies the location of an alternative user home directory
</dl>
If both JMRI_PREFSDIR and JMRI_USERHOME are defined, the location defined by JMRI_PREFSDIR will take precedence over the location defined by JMRI_USERHOME for determining the location of the preferences file.

<h3>Launcher details</h3>

In this section, we briefly describe what the launcher application does.
<dl>
<dt>Directory
<dd>To run, JMRI needs to be able to find things in the current directory. This step changes the current directory to where the launcher is located.

<dt>Java options
<dd>
The launcher sets a number of options for the JVM.  This includes the necessary program settings, setting memory limits, and various symbols to control operation.

<dt>Classpath
<dd>
The script builds the Java classpath automatically to contain, in order:
<ul>
<li>class files in the current directory
<li>class files in the classes subdirectory of the current directory
<li>all jar files in the current directory, except jmri.jar
<li>jmri.jar in the current directory
<li>all jar files in the lib subdirectory of the current directory
</ul>
This allows you to drop jar files into the JMRI install directory for the <a href="plugins.shtml">JMRI plug-in mechanism</a>.


<dt>Java command
<dd>Finally, the launcher puts all this together into a java command, which it executes.

</dl>

<h3>Start Menu shortcuts and Desktop icons</h3>
In a default JMRI installation, a number of shortcuts are created in the Start Menu, along with Desktop Icons for DecoderPro and PanelPro.
<h4>Start Menu shortcuts</h4>
All JMRI Start Menu shortcuts are placed in the "JMRI" start menu folder (or sub-folders) in the following structure:
<ul>
 <li>JMRI
 <ul>
  <li>DecoderPro - launch DecoderPro application
  <li>PanelPro - launch PanelPro application
  <li>SoundPro - launch SoundPro application
  <li>Uninstall - remove entire JMRI suite
  <li>Tools and Demos
  <ul>
   <li>InstallTest - launch InstallTest application
   <li>Preferences - open user preferences folder
  </ul>
 </ul>
</ul>
Additional icons may be placed within this structure depending on the options chosen during installation and the version of JMRI being installed.
<p>
Start Menu shortcut example for DecoderPro (assuming JMRI is installed in the default location "C:\Program Files\JMRI"):
<p><i>Important note: in the following, replace "C:\Program Files\JMRI" by "C:\Program Files (x86)\JMRI" if your Windows is a 64bits version.</i></p>
<dl>
 <dt>Shortcut name
 <dd>'All Users' on Windows 2000 and XP - C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\JMRI\DecoderPro.lnk
 <dd>'All Users' on Windows Vista and 7 - C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\JMRI\DecoderPro.lnk
 <dd>'Current User' on Windows 2000 and XP - C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Start Menu\Programs\JMRI\DecoderPro.lnk
 <dd>'Current User' on Windows Vista and 7 - C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\JMRI\DecoderPro.lnk
 <dt>Target
 <dd>"C:\Program Files\JMRI\LaunchJMRI.exe" apps.gui3.dp3.DecoderPro3
 <dd><i>(up to version 3.11.x was: "C:\Program Files\JMRI\LaunchJMRI.exe" apps.DecoderPro.DecoderPro)</i>
 <dt>Start In
 <dd>"C:\Program Files\JMRI"
 <dt>Shortcut Key
 <dd>None
 <dt>Run
 <dd>Normal window
 <dt>Comment
 <dd>Start Decoder Pro
 <dt>Icon
 <dd>"C:\Program Files\JMRI\decpro5.ico"
</dl>
<h4>Desktop Icons</h4>
Desktop Icons for DecoderPro and PanelPro are created in the default installation - at installation time an optional desktop icon can also be created for the SoundPro application.
<p>
The structure of Desktop Icon creation is similar to that of the Start Menu shortcuts above - example Desktop Icon for DecoderPro (again assuming JMRI is installed in the default location "C:\Program Files\JMRI"):
<dl>
 <dt>Shortcut name
 <dd>'All Users' on Windows 2000 and XP - C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Desktop\DecoderPro.lnk
 <dd>'All Users' on Windows Vista and 7 - C:\Users\Public\Desktop\DecoderPro.lnk
 <dd>'Current User' on Windows 2000 and XP - C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Desktop\DecoderPro.lnk
 <dd>'Current User' on Windows Vista and 7 - C:\Users\[username]\Desktop\DecoderPro.lnk
 <dt>Target
 <dd>"C:\Program Files\JMRI\LaunchJMRI.exe" apps.gui3.dp3.DecoderPro3
 <dd><i>(up to version 3.11.x was: "C:\Program Files\JMRI\LaunchJMRI.exe" apps.DecoderPro.DecoderPro)</i>
 <dt>Start In
 <dd>"C:\Program Files\JMRI"
 <dt>Shortcut Key
 <dd>None
 <dt>Run
 <dd>Normal window
 <dt>Comment
 <dd>Start Decoder Pro
 <dt>Icon
 <dd>"C:\Program Files\JMRI\decpro5.ico"
</dl>

<a name="old_DecoderPro">
<h4>Retrieving "legacy" DecoderPro from versions prior to 4.0.x</h4>

<p>The "legacy" DecoderPro that was existing prior to version 4.0.x has been removed from the distribution package and the former "DecoderPro 3" has been promoted to be the only available DecoderPro version.</p>
<p>If you absolutely cannot use the new DecoderPro user interface (roster view), we suggest one of the following methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Using PanelPro with script</b>: With the exception of a different icon and different fixed buttons on the main window, PanelPro has an identical user interface to the legacy DecoderPro.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You can add the 3 fixed buttons (Open Roster, Service Mode, Operations Mode) that used to be on the legacy DecoderPro by adding a script at start-up.</li>
		<li>Go to Edit > Preferences > Start-up > Scripts > Add Script. Select file "C:\Program Files\JMRI\jython\jython/MakeOriginalDecoderPro.py"</li>
		<li>Then, save and restart.</li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Using PanelPro with buttons</b>:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You can add several fixed buttons of your choice on the PanelPro interface.</li>
		<li>Go to Edit > Preferences > Start-up > Buttons > Add Button. Select the action of your choice. Repeat for as many buttons as you wish.</li>
		<li>For same buttons as on legacy DecoderPro, select "Open Roster", "DecoderPro service programmer" and "DecoderPro ops-mode programmer" </li>
		<li>Then, save and restart.</li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Adding a custom shortcut to legacy DecoderPro</b>:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Copy and Paste the "DecoderPro" shortcut (on your desktop or in the start menu)</li>
		<li>Rename the copy to "DecoderPro legacy" <i>(or anything else of your choice, but <b>not</b> "DecoderPro")</i></li>
		<li>On the new shortcut, right-click > Properties</li>
		<li>In target, replace existing one by: "C:\Program Files\JMRI\LaunchJMRI.exe" apps.DecoderPro.DecoderPro</li>
		<li>This will launch the legacy DecoderPro interface.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
