    <h1>JMRI: Extending the JMRI Programs</h1>

      <p>The original goal of the JMRI project was to produce a library upon
      which people could use to build their own applications. Although some
      people do that, more use the existing applications such as DecoderPro
      and PanelPro.<br>
      We want to make this more flexible by providing a way to
      extend those programs without having to rebuild them from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>There are three supported mechanisms that can be used to plug
        additional capabilities into JMRI:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#script">Script JMRI</a></li>
        <li><a href="#service">Implement a Service Provider</a></li>
        <li><a href="#jmriPlugin">Override jmri.JmriPlugin</a></li>
      </ul>

        See also the separate pages on
        <a href="NewSystem.shtml">adding a new system</a> (i.e. another set of hardware that implements Turnouts, Sensors, clocks, etc)
        and
        <a href="NewType.shtml">adding a new type</a> (e.g. something in addition to Turnouts, Sensors, clocks, etc).
      <h2 id="script">Script JMRI</h2>

      <p><a href="../../tools/scripting">Scripting JMRI</a> is often the easiest
        way to extend JMRI, however there are limitations to that which are
        covered by the other mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>The principal limitations to scripting JMRI are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>scripts can only be run late in the application start process</li>
        <li>scripts cannot be used to define new connection types</li>
        <li>scripts cannot be used to add items to the preferences window</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The details of scripting are <a href="../../tools/scripting">covered
        elsewhere</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Examples of scripts that modify JMRI behavior are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://jmri.org/jython/AddButton.py">AddButton.py</a>
          sample script adds a script button to the main window.
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://jmri.org/jython/DisableOpsMode.py">DisableOpsMode.py</a>
          shows how how to modify the main window to remove the ops-mode
          programming button.
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://jmri.org/jython/ReporterFontControl.py">ReporterFontControl.py</a>
          sample script is an even more advanced example that changes
          the appearance of items on panel screens.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="add">Adding Java Code</h2>

    If you want to add a function that'll need significant code, ideally eventually as a 
    part of JMRI itself, the usual sequence is to write Java code
    <ol>
        <li>that creates objects to run as part of the 
            <a href="IntroStructure.shtml">usual JMRI structures</a></li>
        <li>which are stored and loaded via 
            <a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">configurexml</a> 
            classes that load and store those objects into standard panel files</li>
        <li>optionally has a GUI that starts from an
            <a href="Swing.shtml">action class</a>
            fired from some button or menu item,</li>
        <li>optionally can fire that action at startup to open the GUI by selecting
            it under "Peform action.." in the Startup pane in Preferences,</li>
        <li>optionally can have its own preferences pane to store more info, and</li>
        <li>eventually has 
            <a href="JUnit.shtml">CI unit tests</a>,
            <a href="Javadoc.shtml">documentation</a> and 
            <a href="Help.shtml">help pages</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    Operationally, that's often the best order to develop new function: First, write the
    code (item 1) so that it runs inside JMRI, and use a script to create and start those objects.
    There are two places to put it:
    <ul>
        <li>In a top level package, i.e. a new <code>java/src/mycooltool</code> directory
        alongside <code>java/src/jmri</code> and <code>java/src/apps</code>.  Your
        Java files will start with "import mycooltool;" as a package declaration.</li>
        <li>In a new tools package within the
        <a href="IntroStructure.shtml">JMRI code structure</a>, 
        i.e. a <code>java/src/jmri/jmrit/cooltool</code>
        directory with your java files starting with 
        <code>import jmri.jmrit.coolltool;</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Next, write the 
    <a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">configurexml</a>
    load and store classes, so that once you've got the objects, you can store and reactivate them.
    You still need the script (or an XML editor if the info is simple enough) to create
    them the first time, though, so as a third step 
    <a href="Swing.shtml">write a GUI</a>
    to create that.
    That can be invoked by a one-line script at first, and eventually attached to a menu button.

    <p>Once those first three steps are working and you've created a 
    <a href="Swing.shtml#display">GUI action class</a>,
    you can connect that to "Peform action.." and "Add button to main window .."
    in the Startup pane in Preferences
    by having it extend 
    <a href="#StartupActionFactory"><code>apps.startup.StartupActionFactory</code></a>.
    
    <p>
    The 
    <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrit/sample">jmri.jmrit.sample</a>
    package is an example of this.  
    (See <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/sample/package-summary.html">Javadoc</a>) 
    If contains:
    <ul>
        <li>A single functional class, 
            <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrit/sample/SampleFunctionalClass.java">SampleFunctionalClass</a>
            who's only role is to save a sample string.  Classes like this 
            would be built out to do the work of your project.</li>
        <li>A
            <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrit/sample/configurexml/SampleFunctionalClassXml.java">configurexml.SampleFunctionalClassXml</a>
            class that stores and loads the SampleFunctionalClass object
            contents to a panel file.</li>
        <li>A
            <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrit/sample/swing/SampleConfigPane.java">swing.SampleConfigPane</a>
            class to provide the basis of a cGUI configuration pane.
            This one just shows a label in it's window, but you
            can build it out with whatever else is needed.
            It's connected to the rest of JMRI so that you
            can access configure connections to it in the Preferences.</li>
        <li>
            A complete set of basic test classes. They just
            check the constructors now, but can be built out as needed.</li>
    </ul>
    
        We encourage you to 
        <a href="gitdeveloper.shtml">contribute your code to for inclusion in JMRI</a>.
        That way, lots of people benefit.  But if you don't want to do that,
        you can package it up as a separate .jar file which can
        just be dropped into the JMRI lib/ directory. By using the 
        approach listed above (and the services listed below), JMRI 
        will automatically pick it up and use it.

      <h2 id="service">Implement a Service Provider</h2>
      
      Sometimes what you want to add provides a very specific technical function.
      Many of those can be (though historically, perhaps weren't) written as 
      Service Provider classes.  When they can be done that way, they should be, because
      it simplifies their connection to the rest of the code.

      <p>Java contains a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html">Service Loader</a>
        that allows classes implementing a specific API to provide a service to
        a Java application without requiring that the application have prior
        dependencies defined for that service.
      </p>
      <p>Services are provided by creating a JAR for that service and appending
        it to the JMRI classpath. See <a href="StartUpScripts.shtml">Startup Scripts</a>
        for details on appending a JAR to the classpath and the
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html">Service Loader</a>
        documentation concerning what needs to be in that JAR.
      </p>
      <p>JMRI uses Service Loaders to allow a JMRI application to be extended
        in specific ways:
      </p>
      <dl>

        <dt id="StartupActionFactory"><a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/apps/startup/StartupActionFactory.html">StartupActionFactory</a>

        </dt>
        <dd>Startup Actions can be run at application start or attached to the
          application's main window as a button. Implementations of this factory class
          appear as possible selections for the Perform Action.. 
          and Attach Action to Button.. selections in the Add button on the Startup pane in Preferences.
          <p>
          One example is 
          <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrit/roster/swing/RosterFrameStartupActionFactory.java">the RosterFrameStartupActionFactory class</a>
          which opens the DecoderPro roster window.
          They can also expose additional startup actions that can be selected by the user, 
          i.e. to select one of several possible connections to act on.
        </dd>

        <dt><a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/apps/startup/StartupModelFactory.html">StartupModelFactory</a>

            </dt>
        <dd>Startup Models provide a mechanism to define optional items to be 
          automatically run during the startup process itself. 
          They can take user-specified arguments.
          Implementations of this class appear under the "Add" button 
          in the Startup pane of the Preferences. 
          <p>
          One example is 
          <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/apps/startup/PerformActionModelFactory.java">the PerformActionModelFactory class</a>
          which provides the Perform Action... item.
          PerformActionModelFactory makes the
          <a href="#StartupActionFactory">StartupActionFactory</a>
          implementations available for the user to select. A PerformActionModelFactory object then remembers that
          selection, and during JMRI startup invokes that StartupActionFactory item to do that particular thing.
          Similarly, 
          <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/apps/startup/CreateButtonModelFactory.java">the CreateButtonModelFactory class</a>
          will take a user StartupActionFactory selection and attach it to a button at startup, for
          execution later.
          <p>
          Implementations of this factory class provide the hooks so that the
          Startup preferences can allow a user to set the parameters for a
          given action.

        be overridden once. Generally, the mechanisms further up are better.
