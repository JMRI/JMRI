      <h1>JMRI: Use of Swing</h1>We use Java Swing for our GUI
      development. It's a lot more powerful than the original AWT,
      and the price is right. In particular, we try to use the
      "Bean format" of setting and getting members, call-backs to
      notify of changes, etc, to make it easier to build
      applications from JMRI components.

      <p>We have been evolving a particular pattern for using
      Swing, described here. The JMRI codebase contains several
      generations of implementations, so not all of it looks like
      this, but we're moving classes in this direction as time
      allows.</p>

      <p>The basic structure is to implement graphical tools as
      JmriPanel objects. These are JPanels with enough extra
      structure that the JMRI applications can directly work them.
      For example, a JmriPanel subclass can be instantiated and
      placed in a properly laid out window by creating a
      JmriNamedPanel action with just the name of the JmriPanel
      class, which in turn can be done with various automated
      tools.</p>

      <p>This pattern lets us write a tool panel just once, and
      then use it in lots of various places, embedded into windows
      in several ways. It also greatly reduces the number of
      classes that need to be loaded at startup time, because there
      are not separate *Action and *Frame classes, and JmriPanel
      subclasses don't have to be loaded just because they are
      listed in a menu.</p>

      <p>The <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/swing/package-summary.html">
      jmri.util.swing</a> package contains the suppoer code.</p>

      <h2>Life Cycle of a JmriPanel</h2>First the ctor runs, then
      initComponents. That second part should be the place for
      connections to other components, as all lower level objects
      have been created. (subclasses for particular systems might
      have e.g. more initComponents methods, called later)

      <p>Dispose is called at the end. (Note that JPanels don't
      have a dispose(), that's normally only part of JFrames, but
      we provide it here for cleanup)</p>

      <p>JmriPanels are best created by name with
      JmriNamedPaneAction, which has the advantage of greatly
      reducing the number of classes that need to be loaded to
      populate a menu.</p>

      <p>If it can't be done by name, then JmriAbstractAction is
      the base.</p>

      <p>Use of WindowInterface to create subwindows, so as to put
      them in the right place.</p>

      <p>(See the JavaDocs in that package, which are pretty
      good)</p>

      <p>JmriJFrame is in the wrong place for now.</p>

      <p>Older classes, some still to be moved to jmri.util.swing,
      some are 1.1.8 adapters that should just go away.</p>
