  <h1>JMRI Code: Use of Swing</h1>
      <b>Note:</b> This page describes a toolkit for creating
      JMRI's GUI that's been slowly developed as part of JMRI.
      Please use this if you're creating new JMRI user interfaces.
      Note that there are proposals to move JMRI to other, non-specific
      toolkits in this area. Before you do work to extend or improve
      this toolkit itself, please ask on jmri-developers about that status
      of that work.
      
      <p>We use Java Swing for our GUI
      development. It's a lot more powerful than the original AWT,
      and the price is right. In particular, we try to use the
      "Bean format" of setting and getting members, call-backs to
      notify of changes, etc, to make it easier to build
      applications from JMRI components.

      <p>We have been evolving a particular pattern for using
      Swing, described here. The JMRI codebase contains several
      generations of implementations, so not all of it looks like
      this, but we're moving classes in this direction as time
      allows.</p>

      <a href="images/SwingStructureExample.png"><img src="images/SwingStructureExample.png" align="right" height="193" width="334"></a>
      <p>The basic structure is:
      <ul>
      <li>Keep Swing code in packages with <code>swing</code>
      in the package path.  For example, prefer putting 
      Swing code in <code>jmri.util.swing</code> or a subpackage
      of that, to putting it in <code>jmri.util</code> itself.
      This helps keep the <u>other</u> code non-Swing-specific, e.g.
      so it can be used with other toolkits or on systems without graphics.
      This pattern is similar to the way that 
      <a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">ConfigureXml code</a> lives in 
      separate <code>.configurexml</code> packages.
      <li>Implement graphical tools as
      JmriPanel objects. These are JPanels with enough extra
      structure that the JMRI applications can directly work with them.
      For example, a JmriPanel subclass can be instantiated and
      placed in a properly laid out window by creating a
      JmriNamedPanel action with just the name of the JmriPanel
      class, which in turn can be done with various automated
      tools. Don't create JmriJFrame or JFrame subclasses with
      lots of specific function<br>
      This pattern lets us write a tool panel just once, and
      then use it in lots of various places, embedded into windows
      in several ways. It also greatly reduces the number of
      classes that need to be loaded at startup time, because there
      are not separate *Action and *Frame classes, and JmriPanel
      subclasses don't have to be loaded just because they are
      listed in a menu.
      </ul>

      <a id="life" name="life"/>
      <p>The <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/swing/package-summary.html">
      jmri.util.swing</a> package contains the support code.</p>

      <h2>Life Cycle of a JmriPanel</h2>
      
      First the ctor runs, then
      initComponents. That second part should be the place for
      connections to other components, as all lower level objects
      have been created. (subclasses for particular systems might
      have e.g. more initComponents methods, called later)

      <p>Dispose is called at the end. (Note that JPanels don't
      have a dispose(), that's normally only part of JFrames, but
      we provide it here for cleanup)</p>

      <a id="display" name="display"/>
      <h2>Displaying a JmriPanel</h2>
      
      <p>JmriPanels are best created by name with
      JmriNamedPaneAction, which has the advantage of greatly
      reducing the number of classes that need to be loaded to
      populate a menu.</p>

      <p>To create an action, e.g. for a menu item, the simplest form is:
      <pre><code>
      new jmri.util.swing.JmriNamedPaneAction("Log4J Tree", "jmri.jmrit.log.Log4JTreePane");
      </code></pre>
      The first argument is the human-readable name, and the 2nd is the name of the panel class.
      <p>
      An example of a fuller form:
      <pre><code>
      new jmri.util.swing.JmriNamedPaneAction(Bundle.getMessage("MenuItemLogTreeAction"),<br>
                new jmri.util.swing.sdi.JmriJFrameInterface(),<br>
                "jmri.jmrit.log.Log4JTreePane");
      </code></pre><!-- without <br> does not reflow on iPad when viewd online, causing rest of the page to shrink-->
      <ul>
      <li>The first argument is the human-readable name for the action, 
      e.g. what will show in the menu or on the button.  That's internationalized
      here by using 
      <a href="I8N.shtml">Bundle</a>.
      <li>The second argument is the context in which to display it, which
      in this case is a new plain window.  (See below for more info on the options here)
      <li>And the third argument is the name of the specific JmriPanel
      class to be instantiated and used when the action is invoked.  The class
      isn't loaded until first used, because we've put a String name here, which
      saves a bunch of time at startup for large menus.
      </ul>
      See the 
      <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/swing/JmriNamedPaneAction.html">JmriNamedPaneAction Javadoc</a> for more information.
      
      <p>If you need specialized initialization that can't be built into the
      JmriPanel itself via it's <code>initComponents</code> 
      and <code>initContext(..)</code> methods, perhaps
      to make decision about connections, make a specialized Action class by extending
      <code>jmri.util.swing.JmriNamedPaneAction</code>,
      providing the appropriate constructors, and 
      including a 
      <code>@Override public JmriPanel makePanel()</code>
      method that does any case-specific initialization that's needed
      before the panel can be used. For an example (may have been changed)
      see
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrix/loconet/swing/LnNamedPaneAction.java">jmri.jmrix.loconet.swing.LnNamedPaneAction</a>.
      
      <p>If none that can be used, look into using JmriAbstractAction as
      the base for a separate class implementing Action.</p>

      <h2>Menus, ToolsBars, Buttons, etc</h2>
      If you're using JmriPanels as described above,
      JMRI also provides tools for creating menus, toolbars,
      button fields, etc more easily.
      
      <p>
    Generic creation of menus, toolbars and navigation trees from XML definition
    files are provided by the 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/swing/JMenuUtil.html">jmri.util.swing.JMenuUtil</a>,
    <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/swing/JToolBarUtil.html">jmri.util.swing.JToolBarUtil</a>, and
    <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/swing/JTreeUtil.html">jmri.util.swing.JTreeUtil</a>
    classes
       
      <p>I18N of those menus, toolbars and trees is then done via the XML content
      in the <a href="I8N.shtml">usual way</a>.</p>

      
      <a id="windows" name="windows"/>
      <h2>Window Control</h2>

      JMRI provides three different ways of embedding JmriPanels in windows:
      <ul>
      <li>The jmri.util.swing.sdi package provides the traditional JMRI "single-document interface", where there are multiple independent windows
      <li>The jmri.util.swing.multipane package provides a  "multi-pane" or IDE-style interface", where each window is tiled with inter-related panes.
        This is used for the (new) DecoderPro.
      <li>The jmri.util.swing.mdi package provides a "multi-document interface", where a primary window contains multiple independent sub-windows.
            This currently isn't used by a JMRI app, at least not as far as we know, but it's available if wanted.
      </ul>
        
      <p>Each of those then provides an implementation of WindowInterface that creates new windows, subwindows or other constructs as needed, so as to put
      panels in the right place.</p>

      <p>(See the
      <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/swing/package-summary.html">jmri.util.swing package Javadocs</a>
      for more information</p>

      <h2>Misc</h2>
      
      (This section needs more organization)

      <p>JmriJFrame is in the wrong package for historical reasons, will eventually move to jmri.util.swing.</p>

      <p>Older classes, some still to be moved to jmri.util.swing,
      some are 1.1.8 adapters that should just go away.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>AbstractFrameAction</li>
        <li>BusyGlassPane</li>
        <li>FileChooserFilter</li>
        <li>FontUtil</li>
        <li>JTableUtil</li>
        <li>JmriInsets</li>
        <li>JmriJFrame</li>
        <li>JmriJFrameAction</li>
        <li>JmriSpinner</li>
        <li>MouseInputAdapterInstaller</li>
