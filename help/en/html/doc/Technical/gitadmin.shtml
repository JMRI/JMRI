      <h1>JMRI Code: GitHub Administration</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      
      JMRI uses
      <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
      to host our 
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">main code repository</a>, 
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/releases">releases and downloads</a>
      and 
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues">issues lists</a>.
      It also hosts 
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI">several related repositories</a>.
      
      <p>
      The rest of this page records how we configure and use GitHub,
      along with associated procedures.
      
      <p>
      Related info on other pages:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml">Continuous Integration</a>
            - doesn't really talk about how GitHub is configured for this, now how the services
                are configured</li>
        <li><a href="gitdeveloper.shtml">Labels on Issues/PRs</a></li>
        <li>The
            <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/scripts/HOWTO-distribution.md">release process</a>
            works with GitHub repositories, Issues and releases.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Merging a PR</h2>
      
      Except in exceptional circumstances (which should probably be discussed in the PR itself),
      PRs should only be merged when:
      <ul>
        <li>They have passed all the CI tests</li>
        <li>They have no outstanding reviews</li>
        <li>If in a new area, large or from a new contributor, 
            they have been in-queue for at least a day or so to allow people to take a look at them</li>
        <li>Don't appear to have any un-resolved controversies in the comments</li>
      </ul>
      
      If you want a bit more time before somebody merges a PR, either start a review saying that
      or set "WIP" in the title while explaining why in a comment.

      <p>
      When restarting CI after a failure, please copy at least a few lines around the
      relevant part of the log to a comment. It can be very useful to attach the entire 
      raw log if the failure is obscure, novel or otherwise needs investigation.
      
      <p>
      When merging a PR, please do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Assign it to the original submitter, at least.
            Developers and maintainers can be assigned to any PR, but 
            other people who create PRs can only be assigned to their own.
            By assigning the PR, we make it easy to find what non-developers 
            have contributed.</li>
        <li>Set the current milestone on the PR.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>How we use "Teams"</h2>
      
      <p>What each team does
      
      <p>Terms for adding people to developer status
        <ul>
        <li>Have to have a real name on their GitHub account?</li>
        <li>Have to subscribe (and stay subscribed) to jmri-developers?</li>
        <li>Have to have worked on something other than their own projects?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Branches</h2>
      
      What do we keep as
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/branches">main repository branches</a>
      (as opposed to in user repositories, which is not our problem)?
      When do we clean them out?
