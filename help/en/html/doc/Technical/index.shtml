      <h1>JMRI: Technical Information</h1>

      <p>You don't need to work with your own copy of the JMRI
      source code, compilers, etc if you just want to run the
      programs. You can download completely built copies via the
      <a href="/download">downloads page</a>. But if you'd like to
      play with the code, or get a copy of the program that
      contains updates since the last downloadable version was
      published, this section of the web site will help you get
      started.</p>

      <a id="moreinfo" name="moreinfo"></a>
      <h2>Technical background on the JMRI project</h2>

      <p>JMRI is intended as a jumping-off point for hobbyists who
      want to control their layouts from a computer without having
      to create an entire system from scratch.</p>

      <p>To do this, we've split the problem into two parts with an
      interface in-between:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Above" the interface are the cool tools that people
        want. We provide programmers for DCC decoders, layout
        controls, automation tools, etc. People are continuously
        contributing better and better tools that still will work
        on lots of type of computers, with lots of types of
        layouts.</li>

        <li>"Below" the interface lies code that connects to
        specific layout hardware. We connected to a <a href=
        "../../hardware/index.shtml">full range of systems</a>:
        C/MRI, Digitrax, EasyDCC, Lenz, NCE, etc. We are certainly
        interested in connecting to other systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The long-term strategy is to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a set of publicly available common interfaces
        for model railroad control code, suitable for use with any
        type of layout, from any type of computer.</li>

        <li>Make these useful by providing quality implementations
        for as many types of layouts as possible.</li>

        <li>Encourage interoperability of layout hardware and
        software through the use of common interfaces.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the short term, we've created several programs based on
      the JMRI libraries to move the project along and demonstrate
      its capabilities. (<a href=
      "http://jmri.org/releasenotes/history.html">Why so many
      programs?...</a>)</p>

      <p>The most popular is <a href=
      "../../apps/DecoderPro/index.shtml">DecoderPro</a>, a tool
      for programming decoders. It simplifies the job of
      configuring complicated DCC decoders by providing screens on
      which you can select the various options and values you want.
      These screens show the exact contents of each specific
      decoder type. Both the programming screens and decoder
      information are stored in text files, so you can make up new
      ones as desired.</p><a name="writecode" id="writecode"></a>

      <h2>How can you change how JMRI does things?</h2>

      There are several different ways to modify JMRI:

      <ol>
        <li>You can use the JMRI interfaces to write programs for
        your own layouts. Making this easy is an important goal.
        This can be done via our <a href=
        "../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">scripting
        language</a>.</li>

        <li>You can add new Java code to the program or modify the
        existing code. Fixing things that annoy you (aka bugs) is
        an easy place to jump in and contribute.</li>

        <li>You can write new general-purpose tools. Although this
        is a little harder than writing automation for your own
        layout, writing tools that other people use can be very
        satisfying.</li>

        <li>You can implement the JMRI interfaces for a new system.
        Having JMRI work with other systems is an important goal.
        Once an implementation for another system works, the
        general tools (e.g. symbolic programmer, automations tools,
        signaling, etc) can be immediately used.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>JMRI project information </h2>
      (For people interested in how the software is being written)
      Much of the discussion about JMRI development takes place on
      the JMRI-Developers mailing list: <a href=
      "https://jmri-developers.groups.io/g/jmri/join">
      Subscribe</a>, <a href=
      "https://jmri-developers.groups.io/g/jmri/topics">
      Archive</a>

      <p><a href="http://GitHub.com">GitHub</a> provides our
      software repositories via the <a href=
      "http://GitHub.com/JMRI">GitHub JMRI organization</a>.</p>

      <p>SourceForge.net provides project support:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/">JMRI
        project page</a> and <a href=
        "https://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/activity/?page=0&amp;limit=100">
        project statistics (up to 2018)</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Code</h2>

      All of the JMRI code is available from GitHub.<br>
      See the <a href="getgitcode.shtml">"Getting the code via
      Git"</a> and <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">"Git FAQ"</a> pages for
      more information on how to do that.

      <p>If you just want to look at the contents of a few files,
      you can browse the <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">program source code</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/website">web site source
      code</a> over the web. <a name="buildyourcopy" id=
      "buildyourcopy"></a></p>

      <h2>Building Your Own Copy</h2>

      <p>In addition to getting a copy of the JMRI source code and
      reading it, you can also compile your own version of the
      program to run. You can even include your own modifications
      if you'd like.</p>

      <p>There are several different ways to do this. If you're
      already familiar with one of the popular "Integrated
      Development Environments" (IDEs), look at the navigation bar
      to the left for instructions on how to build JMRI using
      <a href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>, <a href=
      "Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>, or <a href=
      "IntelliJ.shtml">IntelliJ</a>.</p>

      <p>NetBeans provides a very convenient system for building,
      running, and if need be debugging the program. If you're not
      familiar with some other method, we recommend trying <a href=
      "NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a> first.</p>

      <p>Alternately, if you'd like to edit code with your favorite
      text editor and compile it from a command line, please see
      the page of instructions for <a href="Ant.shtml">building
      with Ant</a>.</p><a name="contributing" id=
      "contributing"></a>

      <h2>Contributing</h2>

      <p>We encourage contributions of code, decoder definitions,
      improvements to web pages, etc, to the JMRI project so that
      we can distribute them to the rest of the community.</p>

      <p>For initial and/or small contributions, e.g. a new decoder
      file or small bug fix, you can fill out a new "issue" on
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/new">GitHub</a>.
      You can attach the entire file
      there. If it's more than one files, and you're using an IDE
      like <a href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>, it's very easy to
      create a "diff patch file" to carry your changes, and that
      will save us a significant amount of work merging them in.
      Please see the <a href="NetBeans.shtml#patch">instructions
      for creating a patch file with NetBeans</a>.</p>

      <p>It saves us a lot of work if, before you create and send
      the patch file, you make sure that your copy of the code is
      up to date, and that the <a href="JUnit.shtml#run">unit
      tests</a> all work.</p>

      <p>If you're contributing multiple changes, or working on a
      larger project, JMRI has tools and procedures that make it
      easy and reliable to connect your work to the rest of the
      JMRI community. Basically, you work in a local copy of the
      JMRI code repository, and you're changes can be "pulled" in
      when you're ready to contribute them. See our page on
      "<a href="gitdeveloper.shtml">Being A JMRI Developer</a>" for
      instructions on how to more effectively contribute code
      changes.</p>

      <p>When you contribute your code to JMRI for the first time,
      we'll ask you to sign an assignment form that allows us to
      register copyright on the code, and gives us
      unlimited-duration license to redistribute it consistent with
      the <a href="#use">JMRI licensing</a>. (We regret this
      paperwork, but <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/k/copycomparison.html">Matt Katzer's misuse
      of copyright</a> makes it necessary). If other people also
      helped with the contribution, please let us know so we can
      add them to the <a href=
      "../../../Acknowledgements.shtml">acknowledgements
      page</a>.</p><a name="use" id="use"></a>

      <h2>Licensing</h2>

      We encourage people to build their own projects on top of JMRI.
      That's the original reason that the JMRI&reg; project was started!

      <p>JMRI is licensed only under the "GNU General Public
      License", sometimes called the "GPL". We use version 2 of the
      license, along with the "classpath exception" allowing people
      to link JMRI with their own code under more relaxed
      conditions. Copies of the license are distributed with the
      source and executable downloads, and can be gotten from
      <a href="../../../COPYING">the web</a>.</p>

      <p>This is both an "open source" and a "free" license. For
      more information on those definitions, please see the
      <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source
      Initiative</a> web pages, including their <a href=
      "http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">description
      of what Open Source means</a>, and the <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> web pages,
      particularly their <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">licensing page</a>.</p>

      <p>Informally, the license means that there are only a few
      limitations on what you can do with JMRI. (Check the exact
      wording in <a href="../../../COPYING">the license</a> for the
      details behind the following summary):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You can redistribute it, for free or for a charge to
        cover your costs.</li>

        <li>You can build additional programs on top of all or part
        of JMRI, and distribute JMRI with them. This is OK whether
        or not you charge for your program.</li>

        <li>You can modify the JMRI code for your own
        purposes.</li>

        <li>You can distribute that modified code, though in that
        case you either have to make your modifications available
        to us, or also distribute an unmodified version at the same
        time.</li>

        <li>You cannot use part or all of JMRI in another project
        without either giving credit to JMRI, or making special
        arrangements with us.<br>
        This includes decoder definition files: You are welcome to
        use them, including reformatting their content to another
        form, but you must give JMRI credit for their content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Visualizations of JMRI Development Activity</h2>

      <p>You can see a summary of the JMRI developer activity 
      on the GitHub project page for the
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/graphs/contributors">main code repository</a>
      and 
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/website/graphs/contributors">the website</a>.
      
      <p>The 
      <a href="/community/visuals/codeflower.shtml">JMRI CodeFlower</a>
      provides a dynamic view of the whole GitHub repository.
      It shows the relative size of the code in each file and the
      structure in which the files are stored.
      
      <p>More detailed metrics are available on the
