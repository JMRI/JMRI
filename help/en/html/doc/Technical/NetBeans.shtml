      <h2><a id="intro" name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

      <p>NetBeans 8 (available at <a href=
      "http://www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a>) makes a great
      platform for working with JMRI. The JMRI code is set up to
      work with NetBeans with almost no additional setup. (The
      description below is accurate for the Windows version of
      NetBeans 8. NetBeans is <i>supposed</i> to be identical
      across platforms, but this hasn't been checked on anything
      else).</p>

      <p>NetBeans is a very powerful Integrated Development
      Environment (IDE), which can make working with the JMRI code
      pretty easy. But it takes a little getting used to, and
      reading the tutorials on the <a href=
      "http://netbeans.org">NetBeans web site</a> will be
      helpful.</p>

      <h2><a id="installing" name="installing">Getting and
      Installing NetBeans</a></h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Download NetBeans 8 or late (The Java SE version is
        fine) from <a href=
        "http://www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a><br>
        (If you don't yet have Java Development Kit 8 (JDK)
        installed on your system, download a JDK-NetBeans bundle -
        on the NetBeans download page, look for a link similar to
        "JDK with NetBeans IDE Java SE bundle".)</li>

        <li>Run the NetBeans package installer</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Many Linux distributions have NetBeans available in their
      software repositories - search your package manager for
      NetBeans.</p>

      <h3><a id="windowsUsers" name="windowsUsers"></a>Important note for Windows users</h3>

      <p>Due to different handling of Line Endings characters
      (<code>LF / CR LF</code>) between Windows and other systems -
      namely Unix and OS X (see <a href=
      "GitFAQ.shtml#lineends">Handling Line Ends</a>) - it is of
      the utmost importance that all Windows users adopt the
      following settings for their development environment. This is
      absolutely required so that Git can track individual changes
      on files that you commit.</p>

      <p>If you don't follow these instructions, you'll mess up the
      line endings in the files you commit, which will in turn make
      their revision history much harder to access. Files in this
      condition will not be accepted as pull requests.</p>

      <p>As a first step, as JMRI has adopted <code>LF</code> as a
      convention for Line Endings, it is required to set the
      <code>core.autocrlf</code> setting to <code>true</code> (see
      <a href=
      "https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings">"Dealing
      with line endings" on GitHub Help)</a></p>

      <h4>Additional important note for Netbeans Windows users</h4>

      <p><em>Moreover, if you are using <b>NetBeans</b> on Windows,
      you <u>must</u> install the <a href=
      "http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/46829/change-line-endings-on-save">
      "Change Line Endings on Save" plugin</a> before using Git via
      NetBeans.</em></p>

      <p>Please install the plug-in to make sure that NetBeans
      properly maintains the LF characters at the ends of
      source-code lines.</p>

      <p>Actually the plug-in is already available in the NetBeans
      distribution, so go to <code>Tools &gt; Plugins &gt;
      Available Plugins</code> and there select <code>Change Line
      Endings on Save</code> and then <code>Install</code>.</p>

      <p>You can check that the plug-in is properly installed by
      going to go to <code>Tools &gt; Plugins &gt;
      Installed</code>, where you should see something like this
      (versions might differ):</p>

      <p><a href="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginInstalled.png">
        <img src="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginInstalled.png" height="102" width="224"></a></p>

      <p>Once the plug-in has been installed and activated, it is
      necessary to configure it for the desired line ending
      character(s), via the <code>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Editor
      &gt; Line Endings</code> tab.</p>

      <p>For JMRI, we want to use the Unix-style line ending
      character, <code>LF</code>.</p>

      <p><a href="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginConfiguration.png">
        <img src="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginConfiguration.png" height="168" width="237"></a></p>

      <p>The plug-in may be enabled via a button in the toolbar.
      <a href="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginEnabled.png">
        <img src="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginEnabled.png" height="19" width="55"></a></p>

      <p>And the plug-in may be disabled via that button. 
      <a href="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginDisabled.png">
        <img src="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginDisabled.png" height="19" width="55"></a></p>

      <p>When a file is saved (assuming the plug-in is
      configured and is enabled) and that file has line-endings
      which do not match the type configured for the plug-in, the
      following message pops up.</p>

      <p><a href="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginPopUpWarmingUponSavingAFileWithImproperLineEndings.png">
        <img src="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginPopUpWarmingUponSavingAFileWithImproperLineEndings.png" height="50" width="174"></a></p>

      <p>When "OK" is selected, the plug-in updates the
      line-endings to the configured form and saves the file. If
      "CANCEL" is selected, the file will be saved WITHOUT changing
      any line-endings.</p>

      <h3><a id="heap" name="heap"></a>Java "Heap" size and "low memory" notifications.</h3>

      <p>Netbeans may provide notification of "Low Memory" situations 
      when perfroming some operations, including running certain JMRI
      "targets" within the build.xml file.  Netbeans can become 
      <strong>very</strong> sluggish when it encounters these low memory 
      conditions.  This can happen regardless of the amount of memory 
      your machine has, unless you take steps to re-configure Netbeans.</p>

      <p>By default, Netbeans uses a strategy to allocate a given 
      amount of "Heap" space which is insufficient for projects
      which are as large as JMRI.  JMRI developers who use Netbeans are 
      encouraged to increase the Netbeans default Heap allocation which
      is made when Netbeans is launched.  This is generally done via
      a change to the "netbeans.conf" file.  See <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqSettingHeapSize">
      FaqSettingHeapSize</a> for details.</p>

      <h2><a id="gituse" name="gituse"></a>Using NetBeans with
      JMRI's Git Code Repository</h2>

      <p>GitHub provides JMRI's code repository using the Git tool.
      For more information on how JMRI uses Git, see the JMRI Help
      on <a href="getgitcode.shtml">Getting the code via Git</a>
      and <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">Git FAQ</a>.</p>

      <p>Once set up, NetBeans provides built-in support for using
      Git.</p>

      <p>For more information on Git and NetBeans, see the <a href=
      "https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html">NetBeans Git help
      page</a></p>

      <h3><a id="checkout" name="checkout"></a>Checking out code</h3>

      In NetBeans, under the "Team" menu, select Git, then
      Clone Repository. Enter the
      https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git repository URL from the
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">JMRI GitHub page</a>
      on the NetBeans form under "Repository URL". We recommend
      that you also enter your GitHub user name and password on
      the form, so we can attribute your contributions to you
      later. Click "Next". Make sure that the "master*" box is
      checked to pull down the main version of the code. Click
      "Next", and then click "Finish".

      <p>It'll take a long time to pull down a copy of the code
      (note the progress bar in the lower right), but then
      you're good to go.</p>

          <h3>Local Commits</h3>When using Git, the "commit"
          operation is local to your computer. It doesn't make any
          changes to the main JMRI repository.

          <p>You're encouraged to commit often, so that your
          changes are safely stored away from your working
          directory. Having each small change separately
          recorded can be incredibly helpful later on if you
          have to track down where a problem was introduced.</p>

          <h3><a id="updating" name="updating"></a>Updating the
          code from Git</h3>

          <p>From time to time, you should update your local copy
          of the code to match the current "HEAD" of the main JMRI
          Git repository contents. The basic process is to pull the
          most recent copies from the main JMRI repository, doing
          any merging that's needed if you've made conflicting
          changes, and then pushing that up to your own GitHub
          repository.</p>

          <p>To do this, use the NetBeans [Team] -&gt; [Remote]
          -&gt; [Pull from Upstream] menu choice. Tell NetBeans to
          pull from the "github" remote you defined above.</p>

          <p>You may also update a single file or the contents of a
          folder, by right-clicking on an item in the "Files"
          window, then selecting [Git] -&gt; [Remote] -&gt; [Pull
          from Upstream].</p>

          <h3><a id="pullreq" name="pullreq"></a>Creating a Pull
          Request</h3>

          <p>A "Pull Request" (PR) is an easy way to gather up all
          your changes, even if they span multiple files, into
          something that you can then submit for inclusion in the
          main JMRI repository.</p>

          <p>First, you need to set up a GitHub account and your
          own repository.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Get a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub
            account</a> and login</li>

            <li>Tell GitHub to <a href=
            "https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">"fork"
            JMRI's repository</a> into one of your own. There's a
            <a href=
            "https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">good
            help page</a>, but basically you go to the <a href=
            "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">JMRI repository page</a>
            and click the "fork" button in the upper right.</li>
          </ul>This gives you your own repository, which you can
          then work with freely.

          <p>Next, push the changes up to your repository. (Anybody
          can push to their own repository, but most people don't
          have permission to directly modify the main JMRI
          repository; that's why the pull request is needed) To do
          this:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Use the NetBeans [Team] &gt; [Remote] &gt; [Push
            ...] menu choice. (If you try to use the "Push to
            Upstream" choice, it will try to write back to the main
            repository, and will fail.)</li>

            <li>Click on Specify Git Repository, and enter the URL
            for your own repository, e.g.
            https://github.com/yourname/JMRI.git</li>

            <li>Then click next.</li>

            <li>NetBeans will check with the repository, and show
            an indication of branches to push e.g. "master -&gt;
            master" Check the appropriate box to for the branch
            you've been working on.</li>

            <li>Click Next and Finish. Netbeans will do the actual
            push to your repository.</li>
          </ul>You can repeat this as many times as you'd like as
          you're working on your changes. Each time, the most
          recent changes are pushed up and made available.

          <p>Finally, when your change is ready to submit, go to
          the GitHub web site to <a href=
          "gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">fill out and submit a pull
          request</a>.</p>

          <p>Eventually, somebody will look at the pull request and
          decide whether to merge it in. Sometimes they'll ask for
          additional changes. In that case, you can update the pull
          request by just pushing new changes to the your
          repository, where they'll automatically be picked up.</p>

          <h2><a id="buildandrun" name="buildandrun">Building and
          running JMRI</a></h2>

          <p>To build and run DecoderPro, all you have to do is
          select "Run Project (JMRI)" from the Run menu, or click
          the Run icon in the tool bar.<br>
          A new JMRI checkout should build cleanly. If not, please
          check with the JMRIusers or jmri-developers mailings
          lists for help.</p>
          <a href="images/NetBeansContextLaunch.png"><img src="images/NetBeansContextLaunch.png" height="319" width="147" align="right"></a>
          <ul>
            <li>[Run] -&gt; [Run Project (JMRI)] will compile and
            invoke DecoderPro</li>

            <li>You can choose other targets (i.e. PanelPro...) by
            right-clicking (or control clicking) to get the 
            project contextual menu.  This works in 
            various places, but most certainly on the 
            "JMRI" icon under Projects in the left side-bar.
            In the middle of that menu are 
            items for launching PanelPro, launching DecoderPro
            and doing other build steps.</li>
            
            <li>The "Debug" target is a special case.
            Which program (PanelPro vs DecoderPro) 
            is defined by a line near the end of the
            nbproject/ide-targets.xml file in the 
            JMRI source directory. Perhaps 
            somebody can some day figure out a 
            better way to configure that...
          </ul>

          <p>If you want to run the program under the NetBeans
          debugger, first set JMRI to be the Main project via
          [Run]-&gt;[Set Main Project]-&gt;[JMRI] then select
          "Debug Main Project" from the "Debug" menu.</p>

          <h2><a id="jar" name="jar">Making a Jar File</a></h2>Most
          of the code in a normal JMRI installation lives in a file
          called jmri.jar. If you want to replace this with your
          updated version, you need to create a new jmri.jar file
          from your modified code.

          <p>To do this, ctrl-click (or right-click) on the name of
          the "JMRI" project in the "Projects" window. This will
          open a pop-up menu, on which you'll find "Make Jar File".
          Select that, and a new jmri.jar file will be produced in
          the project's main directory.</p>

          <p>Alternately, from the "Files" window, right-click on
          the build.xml file, and select "Run Target", then
          "jar".</p>

          <h2><a id="nsis" name="nsis">Making a release package for
          Windows using NSIS</a></h2>

          <p>It is possible for NetBeans users to create a release
          package for use on the Windows platform. This requires
          installation of the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
          (NSIS), which can be downloaded from <a href=
          "http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis">the NSIS project
          web site</a> on SourceForge.</p>

          <p>Once NSIS is installed on the computer, it is
          necessary to create a file called local.properties in the
          same directory as JMRI's build.xml file. This file is
          specifically <i>not</i> checked in via GitHub, so that your
          machine-specific tool installation paths are <i>not</i>
          checked in to GitHub. Create the file, and add a variable
          definition with the correct path to the directory which
          includes the NSIS executable, such as:</p>

          <p style="font-family: monospace">nsis.home=C:/Program
          Files (x86)/NSIS/</p>

          <p>or</p>

          <p style="font-family: monospace">
          nsis.home=/opt/nsis/nsis-2.46/</p>
          <p><em>Note:</em> Make sure the trailing / is present.</p>

          <p>If you will be installing the SpotBugs tool, you will
              also define spotbugs.home in this file. You may also
              define several other machine-specific and user-specific
          information as described in various locations in the
          build.xml file.</p>

          <p>With the NSIS package installed to your computer, and
          build.xml properly modified, the Windows package may be
          created by running the "package-windows" ant target in
          build.xml.</p>

          <h2><a id="xmltools" name="xmltools">Using NetBeans XML
          tools</a></h2>NetBeans has nice tools for working with
          XML files, including editing and validating them. JMRI
          uses XInclude to include "fragment" XML files in other
          ones via URLs that point to the main JMRI web site:
          http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/types/foo.xml JMRI programs
          convert these at run time to local file references, but
          by default NetBeans doesn't know to do this.

          <p>You can tell NetBeans how handle this by adding the
          xml/catalog.xml file (from the JMRI distribution to
          NetBeans at Tools -&gt; DTDs and XML Schemas. This will
          allow NetBeans to use your local schema when validating
          an XML document in the editor. Note that this is global
          setting in NetBeans, so if you are working on multiple
          JMRI branches, whichever branch you add the catalog from,
          that branch's schema is what is used.</p>

          <h2><a id="SpotBugs" name="SpotBugs">Running
                  SpotBugs</a></h2>

          <p>The SpotBugs tool is a static code analysis tool which
              examines JAVA source code for common coding issues.
          Installation of a SpotBugs tool allows an ant task
          defined in build.xml to run SpotBugs analysis across all
          of the JAVA source code in JMRI.</p>

          <p>It appears that the build.xml file is not configured
              to allow a NetBeans SpotBugs "plugin" to run analysis on
              the JMRI code except on a one-file-at- a-time basis. As
          such, it seems advisable to download and install the
          appropriate stand-alone SpotBugs tool for your operating
          system. SpotBugs downloads may be found at <a href=
                                                        "https://spotbugs.github.io">the SpotBugs web
              site</a>.</p>

          <p>Once you have the SpotBugs tool installed, you must
              provide a path to the directory containing the executable
          for use by the build.xml ant file. If necessary, create
          the local.properties file in the same directory as the
          JMRI build.xml file. In the local.properties file, add
          the variable spotbugs.home with a path to the spotbugs
          executable, such as:</p>

          <p style="font-family: monospace">
              spotbugs.home=C:/spotbugs-3.1.1/</p>

          <p>or</p>

          <p style="font-family: monospace">
              spotbugs.home=/opt/spotbugs-3.1.1/</p>

          <p>To run the SpotBugs tool on JMRI code, execute the ant
              target "spotbugs" which is defined in build.xml. Within
              NetBeans this can be accomplished by right-clicking
          build.xml in the "Files" pane and "Run"ing the "spotbugs"
          target. When SpotBugs completes, the NetBeans Output
          window will show the path to a report file in HTML
          format. Open that file with a browser to review the
          SpotBugs results.</p>

          <h2><a id="compileIndividualFile" name=
          "compileIndividualFile">NetBeans and compiling individual
          files</a></h2>

          <p>The NetBeans IDE shows icons to the side of each
          object in the Projects window, and to the side of each
          file in the Files window. These icons can reflect the
          status of each item, including local change and proper
          compilation status.</p>

          <p>At this time, the files (in the project's nbproject/
          directory) which control how NetBeans performs individual
          file compilation, do not properly reflect all of the
          requirements of the JMRI project. <i>Until these files
          are properly updated, the error icons will persist within
          the JMRI project.</i> These error icons do <i>not</i>
          affect the ability of NetBeans to compile the source
          files using the Ant tasks defined in the project's
          build.xml file.</p>

          <p>Building the JMRI .jar file, and executing a JMRI tool
          from within NetBeans is generally done via Ant tasks,
          which are defined in the project's build.xml file. JMRI's
          developers have generally kept this file up-to-date, so
          building the JMRI .jar file, and executing a JMRI tool
          from within NetBeans generally does not suffer from the
          shortcomings of the configuration information found in
          the files in the project's nbproject/ directory.</p>

        <h2><a id="fetch" name="fetch"></a>Loading a Specific Branch from GitHub</h2>
        
        The process for building from a branch (i.e. the one where someone has put a change) 
        is a bit different from the standard instructions.  
        (The following is NetBeans 8.2, but it doesn't vary with versions much)
        <ul>
        <li>Under "Team" -> "Remote" select "Fetch" (not Fetch from Upstream)
        <br><a href="images/38030695-285ba828-324e-11e8-8e73-7ff0f6c32125.png">
            <img src="images/38030695-285ba828-324e-11e8-8e73-7ff0f6c32125.png" height="212" width="236"></a></li>

        <li>Fill out the form to specify the correct user's repository 
        (After the 1st time you do this, you'll be able to select by name in the top choice)
        <br><a href="images/38030828-932040d8-324e-11e8-933f-cee0bf6f45e2.png">
            <img src="images/38030828-932040d8-324e-11e8-933f-cee0bf6f45e2.png" height="147" width="247"></a></li>

        <li>On the next screen to select a branch, you can either select all of them (there's a button) 
        or find and select just the name of the branch that holds the desired change:

        <br><a href="images/38030974-fa9a7b52-324e-11e8-86f2-23c0c8735c9c.png">
            <img src="images/38030974-fa9a7b52-324e-11e8-86f2-23c0c8735c9c.png" height="101" width="339"></a></li>

        <li>Click "Finish"</li>
        </ul>

        At this point, you've pulled my changes onto your local machine, but you're not using them yet.  
        To have those files appear locally for NetBeans to build:

        <ul>
        <li>Back on the main menu, select "Team" -> "Checkout" -> "Checkout Revision...". 
        On the window you get, click "Select":
        <br><a href="images/38031217-94948748-324f-11e8-8d61-8451af389d2e.png">
            <img src="images/38031217-94948748-324f-11e8-8d61-8451af389d2e.png" height="208" width="268"></a></li>

        <li>In the upper left, find the imported branch you want, which in the example is "bobjacobsen/ast-clock-power-bit". 
        Either click to highlight (show) and then click "Select", or just double click on it.  
        (Don't worry about the upper right or the lower box, they'll be automatically set right)
        <br><a href="images/38031418-024b9f92-3250-11e8-9d52-aca1db8d4435.png">
            <img src="images/38031418-024b9f92-3250-11e8-9d52-aca1db8d4435.png" height="259" width="321"></a></li>

        <li>Back on the "Checkout Revision ..." window, make sure the "Checkout as New Branch" 
            is <u>not</u> checked, and then click "Checkout"</li>
        </ul>
        
    Now you've got a copy of my changes as your checked-out source.  
    You should do a "Clean and Build Project" to make sure that you get a consistent compilation, 
    and then you should be able to run it.
    <p>
    <em>Important note:</em>  When you want to get back to the <u>standard</u> JMRI version, 
        from the main repository, you need to check out the "master" branch.  
        The process is similar, and simpler. 
         Go to "Team" -> "Checkout" -> "Checkout Revision...", type just "master" (no quotes) 
         in the "Checkout Selected Revision" box, and click "Checkout"
