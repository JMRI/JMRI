    <h2><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>NetBeans 8 (available at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a>)
    makes a great platform for working with JMRI.
    The JMRI code is setup to work with NetBeans with almost no
    additional setup.
    (The description below is accurate for the Windows version of NetBeans 8.
    NetBeans is <i>supposed</i> to be identical across platforms, but this hasn't 
    been checked on anything else). </p>
    <p>NetBeans is a very powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
    which can make working with the JMRI code pretty easy.  But it takes a little
    getting used to, and reading the tutorials on the 
    <a href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans web site</a>
    will be helpful.
    </p>

    
    <h2><a id="installing">Getting and Installing NetBeans</a></h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Download NetBeans 8 or late (The Java SE version is fine) from 
            <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a><br>
		(If you don't yet have Java Development Kit 8 (JDK) installed on your
            system, download a JDK-NetBeans bundle - on the NetBeans download page, 
            look for a link similar to "JDK with NetBeans IDE Java SE bundle".)</li>
        <li> Run the NetBeans package installer</li>
    </ul>
	<p>Many Linux distributions have NetBeans available in their software repositories
	- search your package manager for NetBeans.</p>
    
    <h3>Important note for Windows users</h3>
    
    <p>Due to different handling of Line Endings characters (<code>LF / CR LF</code>) between Windows and other systems - namely Unix and OS X 
        (see <a href="GitFAQ.shtml#lineends">Handling Line Ends</a>) - it is of the utmost importance that all Windows users
    adopt the following settings for their development environment. This is absolutely required so that Git can track individual changes on files that you commit.</p>
    <p>If you don't follow these instructions, you'll mess up the line endings in the files you commit, which will in turn
        make their revision history much harder to access. Files in this condition will not be accepted as pull requests.</p>

    
    <p>As a first step, as JMRI has adopted <code>LF</code> as a convention for Line Endings,
        it is required to set the <code>core.autocrlf</code> setting to <code>true</code> 
        (see <a href=https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings>"Dealing with line endings" on GitHub Help)</a> </p>
    
    <h4>Additional important note for Netbeans Windows users</h4>    

    <p><em>Moreover, if you are using <b>NetBeans</b> on Windows, you <u>must</u> install the
        <a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/46829/change-line-endings-on-save">"Change Line Endings on Save" plugin</a>
        before using Git via NetBeans.</em>
    <p>Please install the plug-in to make sure that NetBeans properly 
        maintains the LF characters at the ends of source-code lines.</p>
    <p>Actually the plug-in is already available in the NetBeans distribution, 
        so go to <code>Tools > Plugins > Available Plugins</code>
        and there select <code>Change Line Endings on Save</code> and then <code>Install</code>.</p>
    <p>You can check that the plug-in is properly installed by going to go to <code>Tools > Plugins > Installed</code>,
        where you should see something like this (versions might differ):</p>
    <p><a href="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginInstalled.png"><img src="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginInstalled.png" align="center" height="102" width="224"></a></p>  

    <p>Once the plug-in has been installed and activated, it is necessary to configure it for the desired line ending character(s), via the <code>Tools > Options > Editor > Line Endings</code> tab.</p>
    <p>For JMRI, we want to use the Unix-style line ending character, <code>LF</code>.</p>    
    <p><a href="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginConfiguration.png"><img src="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginConfiguration.png" align="center" height="168" width="237"></a></p>

    <p>The plug-in may be enabled via a button in the toolbar.
    <a href="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginEnabled.png"><img src="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginEnabled.png" align="center" height="19" width="55"></a></p>

    <p>And the plug-in may be disabled via that button.
    <a href="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginDisabled.png"><img src="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginDisabled.png" align="center" height="19" width="55"></a></p>

    <p>When a file is saved (assuming the the plug-in is configured and is enabled) and that file has line-endings which do not match the type configured for the plug-in, the following message pops up.</p>
    <p><a href="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginPopUpWarmingUponSavingAFileWithImproperLineEndings.png"><img src="images/NetbeansChangeLineEndingsPluginPopUpWarmingUponSavingAFileWithImproperLineEndings.png" align="center" height="50" width="174"></a></p>

    <p>When "OK" is selected, the plug-in updates the line-endings to the configured form and saves the file.  If "CANCEL" is selected, the file will be saved WITHOUT changing any line-endings.</p>   
    
    <h2><a id="gituse" name="gituse"></a>Using NetBeans with JMRI's Git Code Repository</h2>
    
      <p>GitHub provides JMRI's code repository using the Git tool. 
        For more information on how JMRI uses Git, see the JMRI Help on
        <a href="getgitcode.shtml">Getting the code via Git</a> and
         <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">Git FAQ</a>.
        
        <p>Once set up, NetBeans provides built-in support 
        for using Git.</p>
        
        <p>For more information on Git and NetBeans, see the
        <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html">NetBeans Git help page</a>

    <h3><a id="setup" name="setup"></a>Checking out code</h3>
      <li>In NetBeans, under the "Team" menu, select Git, then Clone Repository.
        Enter the https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git repository URL from the 
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">JMRI GitHub page</a>
        on the NetBeans form under "Repository URL".  We recommend that you
        also enter your GitHub user name and password on the form, so 
        we can attribute your contributions to you later. Click "Next".
        Make sure that the "master*" box is checked to pull down the main
        version of the code. Click "Next", and then click "Finish".
        <p>
        It'll take a long time to pull down a copy of the code
        (note the progress bar in the lower right), 
        but then you're good to go.
    
    <h3>Local Commits</h3>
    
        When using Git, the "commit" operation is local to your computer.
        It doesn't make any changes to the main JMRI repository.
        <p>
        You're encouraged to commit often, so that your changes are safely stored
        away from your working directory and that each small change is separately
        recorded.

    <h3><a id="updating" name="updating"></a>Updating the code from Git</h3>

        <p>From time to time, you should update your local copy of the code to match 
            the current "HEAD" of the main JMRI Git repository contents. 
            The basic process is to pull 
            the most recent copies from the main JMRI repository, doing any merging that's
            needed if you've made conflicting changes, and then pushing that up to your
            own GitHub repository.
            
        <p>To do this, use the NetBeans [Team] -&gt; [Remote] -&gt; [Pull from Upstream] menu choice.
            Tell NetBeans to pull from the "github" remote you defined above.
        
        <p>You may also update a single file or the contents of a folder, by
            right-clicking on an item in the "Files" window, then selecting 
            [Git] -&gt; [Remote] -&gt; [Pull from Upstream].</p>
    

    <h3><a id="pullreq" name="pullreq"></a>Creating a Pull Request</h3>
    
        <p>A "Pull Request" (PR) is an easy way to gather up all your changes, even
        if they span multiple files, into something that you can then submit
        for inclusion in the main JMRI repository.
        
        <p>First, you need to set up a GitHub account and your
        own repository. 
          <ul>
          <li>Get a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a> and login
          <li>Tell GitHub to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">"fork" JMRI's repository</a> 
          into one of your own. There's a 
          <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">good help page</a>,
          but basically you go to the 
          <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">JMRI repository page</a>
          and click the "fork" button in the upper right.
          </ul>

        This gives you your own repository, which you can then work with freely.

        <p>
        Next, push the changes up to your repository.  (Anybody can push to their own 
        repository, but most people don't have permission to directly modify the main
        JMRI repository; that's why the pull request is needed) To do this:
        <ul>
        <li>Use the NetBeans [Team] &gt; [Remote] &gt; [Push ...] menu choice. (If you try to use the "Push to Upstream"
        choice, it will try to write back to the main repository, and will fail.)
        <li>Click on Specify Git Repository, and enter the URL for your own repository, e.g. https://github.com/yourname/JMRI.git
        <li>Then click next.  
        <li>
        NetBeans will check with the repository, and show an indication of branches to push
        e.g. "master -&gt; master"
        Check the appropriate box to for the branch you've been working on. 
        <li>Click Next and Finish.
        Netbeans will do the actual push to your repository.
        </ul>
        You can repeat this as many times as you'd like as you're working on your changes.
        Each time, the most recent changes are pushed up and made available.
        <p>Finally, when your change is ready to submit, go to the 
        GitHub web site to
        <a href="gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">fill out and submit a pull request</a>.
        <p>Eventually, somebody will look at the pull request and decide whether to 
        merge it in. Sometimes they'll ask for additional changes. In that case, you
        can update the pull request by just pushing new changes to the your repository, where
        they'll automatically be picked up.
        

    <h2><a id="buildandrun">Building and running JMRI</a></h2>
    <p>    To build and run DecoderPro, all you have to do is select
           "Run Project (JMRI)" from the Run menu, or click the Run icon in the tool bar.
           <br>
		A new JMRI checkout should build cleanly. If not, please
		check with the JMRIusers or jmri-developers mailings lists for help.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>[Run] -> [Run Project (JMRI)] will compile and invoke DecoderPro 
        <li>You can choose other targets (i.e. PanelPro...) by changing 
                [File]-&gt;[Project Properties (JMRI)]-&gt;[Build and Run]-&gt;[Run Project]
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you want to run the program under the NetBeans debugger,
        first set JMRI to be the Main project via [Run]-&gt;[Set Main Project]-&gt;[JMRI] then
        select "Debug Main Project" from the "Debug" menu.
    </p>

    <h2><a id="jar">Making a Jar File</a></h2>

    Most of the code in a normal JMRI installation lives in a file called
    jmri.jar.  If you want to replace this with your updated version, you
    need to create a new jmri.jar file from your modified code.  
    <P>
    To do this,
    ctrl-click (or right-click) on the name of the "JMRI" project in the
    "Projects" window.  This will open a pop-up menu, on which you'll
    find "Make Jar File". Select that, and a new jmri.jar file will be
    produced in the project's main directory.
    <p>Alternately, from the "Files" window, right-click on the build.xml file,
        and select "Run Target", then "jar".</p>
    

    <h2><a id="nsis">Making a release package for Windows using NSIS</a></h2>

    <p>It is possible for NetBeans users to create a release package for use on 
        the Windows platform.  This requires installation of the Nullsoft Scriptable 
        Install System (NSIS), which can be downloaded from 
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis"> the NSIS project web site</a> 
        on SourceForge.</p>
    <p>Once NSIS is installed on the computer, it is necessary to create a file called
        local.properties in the same directory as JMRI's build.xml file.  This file is
        specifically <i>not</i> checked in via SVN, so that your machine-specific
        tool installation paths are <i>not</i> checked in to SVN.  Create the file, 
        and add a variable definition with the correct path to the directory which
        includes the NSIS executable, such as:</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">nsis.home=C:/Program Files (x86)/NSIS</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">nsis.home=/opt/nsis/nsis-2.46/</p>
    <p>If you will be installing a "findbugs" tool, you will also define findbugs.home
        in this file.  You may also define several other machine-specific and 
        user-specific information as described in various locations in the 
        build.xml file.</p>
    <p>With the NSIS package installed to your computer, and build.xml properly 
            modified, the Windows package may be created by running the 
            "package-windows" ant target in build.xml.</p>

    <h2><a id="xmltools">Using NetBeans XML tools</a></h2>
    
    NetBeans has nice tools for working with XML files, including
    editing and validating them.  JMRI uses XInclude to include
    "fragment" XML files in other ones via URLs that point to
    the main JMRI web site:  http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/types/foo.xml
    JMRI programs convert these at run time to local file references,
    but by default NetBeans doesn't know to do this.
    <p>
    You can tell NetBeans how handle this by adding the 
    xml/catalog.xml file (from the JMRI distribution to 
    NetBeans
    at Tools -> DTDs and XML Schemas.
    This will allow NetBeans to use your local schema when validating an XML document in the editor. 
    Note that this is global setting in NetBeans, so if you are working on multiple JMRI branches, 
    whichever branch you add the catalog from, that branch's schema is what is used.

    <h2><a id="findbugs">Running FindBugs</a></h2>

    <p>The FindBugs tool is a static code analysis tool which examines JAVA source code
        for common coding issues.  Installation of a FindBugs tool allows an ant task
        defined in build.xml to run FindBugs analysis across all of the JAVA source code
        in JMRI.</p>
    <p>It appears that the build.xml file is not configured to allow a NetBeans
        FindBugs "plugin" to run analysis on the JMRI code except on a one-file-at-
        a-time basis.  As such, it seems advisable to download and install the
        appropriate stand-alone FindBugs tool for your operating system.  FindBugs
        downloads may be found at <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net">the 
        FindBugs web site</a>.
    <p>Once you have the FindBugs tool installed, you must provide a path to the 
        directory containing the executable for use by the build.xml ant file.  
        If necessary, create the local.properties file in the same directory as 
        the JMRI build.xml file.  In the local.properties file, add the variable 
        findbugs.home with a path to the findbugs executable, such as:</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">findbugs.home=C:/findbugs-1.3.8</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">findbugs.home=/opt/findbugs-1.3.8</p>
    <p>To run the FindBugs tool on JMRI code, execute the ant target "findbugs" 
        which is defined in build.xml.  Within NetBeans this can be accomplished 
        by right-clicking build.xml in the "Files" pane and "Run"ing the "findbugs" 
        target.  When FindBugs completes, the NetBeans Output window will show 
        the path to a report file in HTML format.  Open that file with a browser 
        to review the FindBugs results.</p>        

    <h2><a id="compileIndividualFile">NetBeans and compiling individual files</a></h2>
        <p>The NetBeans IDE shows icons to the side of each object in the Projects window,
            and to the side of each file in the Files window.  These icons can reflect the
            status of each item, including local change and proper compilation status.</p>
        <p>At this time, the files (in the project's nbproject/ directory) which 
            control how NetBeans performs individual file compilation, do not properly
            reflect all of the requirements of the JMRI project.  <i>Until these files
            are properly updated, the error icons will persist within the JMRI project.</i>
            These error icons do <i>not</i> affect the ability of NetBeans to compile the 
            source files using the Ant tasks defined in the project's build.xml file.</p>
        <p>Building the JMRI .jar file, and executing a JMRI tool from within
            NetBeans is generally done via Ant tasks, which are defined in the project's
            build.xml file.  JMRI's developers have generally kept this file up-to-date,
            so building the JMRI .jar file, and executing a JMRI tool from within NetBeans
            generally does not suffer from the shortcomings of the configuration information
            found in the files in the project's nbproject/ directory.</p>

  <h2><a id="patch">Making a Patch File</a></h2>
    
    <p>A "diff patch file" was an easy way with SVN to gather up all your changes, even
    if they span multiple files, into one file.
    This can be used to e.g. submit a patch.
    Now that we're using Git and GitHub, however, we prefer that you 
    contribute your code changes as a
    <a href="gitdeveloper.shtml">GitHub Pull Requests</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    To create the "diff patch file" <strong>[deprecated]</strong>:
    <ul>
 
    <li>From the [Team] menu, select "Export Diff Patch ..."
    <li>A file browser will open; enter a new file name
        in your preferred location and hit "Save" or "Open", 
        depending on what the dialog shows. 
    <li>After it finishes calculating the diffs, the file you selected will contain
        the patches, along with an information header.
