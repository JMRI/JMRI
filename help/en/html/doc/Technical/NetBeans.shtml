    <h2><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>NetBeans 7.2 (available at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a>)
    makes a great platform for working with JMRI.
    The JMRI code is setup to work with NetBeans with almost no
    additional setup.
    (The description below is accurate for the Windows version of NetBeans 7.2.
    NetBeans is <i>supposed</i> to be identical across platforms, but this hasn't 
    been checked on anything else). </p>
    <p>NetBeans is a very powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
    which can make working with the JMRI code pretty easy.  But it takes a little
    getting used to, and reading the tutorials on the 
    <a href="http://netbeans.org/community/releases/72/">NetBeans 7.2 web site</a>
    will be helpful.
    </p>

    
    <h2><a id="installing">Getting and Installing NetBeans</a></h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Download NetBeans 7.2 (The Java SE version is fine) from 
            <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a><br>
		(If you don't yet have Java Development Kit 6.0 (JDK) installed on your
            system, download a JDK-NetBeans bundle - on the NetBeans download page, 
            look for a link similar to "JDK with NetBeans IDE Java SE bundle".)</li>
        <li> Run the NetBeans package installer</li>
    </ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>Many Linux distributions have NetBeans available in their software repositories
	- search your package manager for NetBeans.</p>
    
    <h2><a id="checkout">Checking out code</a></h2>
    <p>Subversion (also known as SVN) provides version control for projects hosted 
        at sourceforge.net, such as the JMRI project.  NetBeans provides built-in support 
        for SVN functionality.  NetBeans SVN support may be configured in either 
        of two ways, depending on how the user wishes to interact with the SVN 
        repository.</p>
    <p>Users who wish to get a copy of the code, but do not wish to
        make commits (i.e. changes) to the JMRI SVN repository at sourceforge.net 
        may configure NetBeans 
        SVN to access the repository in a read-only mode.  These users do
        not need an account at sourceforge.net.  Once a NetBeans project is 
        configured for this "read-only" SVN access of the JMRI code 
        repository, it will be difficult to later "commit" changed code
        to the JMRI repository.  Instructions to check out
        a copy of JMRI source code without an easy ability to update the 
        JMRI repository are found below at <a href="#checkoutNoCommmit">
            Configuring NetBeans SVN to allow only Check-out</a>.
        </p>
    <p>Users who wish to get a copy of the code, and who <i>do</i> wish to
        be able to make commits (i.e. changes) to the JMRI SVN repository at sourceforge.net may 
        configure NetBeans SVN to access the repository in a read-write mode.  
        These users require an account at sourceforge.net, and this account
        information is used every time NetBeans/Subversion is used to access the JMRI
        SVN repository.  Instructions to check out
        a copy of JMRI source code without an easy ability to update the 
        JMRI repository are found below at <a href="#checkoutWithCommitAllowed">
            Configuring NetBeans SVN to allow both Check-out and Commit</a>
        </p>
      <h3><a id="checkoutNoCommmit">Configuring NetBeans SVN to allow only Check-out</a></h3> 
    <p>The easiest way to get the initial copy of the code (<i>without the ability 
        to commit changes to the JMRI SVN repository</i>), as well as the files for 
        all available translations of the help pages, is to 
        check it out using NetBeans' integrated SVN, without using a personal 
        sourceforge.net account .  Once you've done that,
        NetBeans will automatically use it.  When using this process, it will <i>not</i>
        be possible to submit changes to the SVN repository.  If you have a sourceforge.net
        login, and are a member of the sourceforge.net JMRI project, then you will want to use a 
        different configuration in NetBeans.  See <a href="#checkoutWithCommitAllowed">
            Configuring NetBeans SVN to allow both Check-out and Commit</a></p>
    <p>Here's how:</p>
    <p>Start NetBeans and do the following steps. Text in brackets [] are menu items to be selected
    or buttons to be pressed.

    <h2><a id="updating">Updating the code from SVN</a></h2>

    <p>From time to time, you can update your local copy of the code to match 
        the current "head" of the sourceforge.net JMRI SVN repository contents. 
        To do this, use the NetBeans [Team]-&gt;[Update] menu choice.</p>
    <p>You may also update a single file or the contents of a folder, by
        right-clicking on an item in the "Files" window, then selecting 
        [Subversion]-&gt;[Update].</p>
    
    <h2><a id="buildandrun">Building and running JMRI</a></h2>
    <p>    To build and run DecoderPro, all you have to do is select
           "Run Project (JMRI)" from the Run menu, or click the Run icon in the tool bar.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Run -> Run Project (JMRI)  <em>will compile and invoke DecoderPro</em>
        <li><em>You can choose other targets (i.e. PanelPro...) by changing 
                [File]-&gt;[Project Properties (JMRI)]-&gt;[Build and Run]-&gt;[Run Project]</em>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you want to run the program under the NetBeans debugger,
        first set JMRI to be the Main project via [Run]-&gt;[Set Main Project]-&gt;[JMRI] then
        select "Debug Main Project" from the "Debug" menu.
    </p>

    <h2><a id="jar">Making a Jar File</a></h2>

    Most of the code in a normal JMRI installation lives in a file called
    jmri.jar.  If you want to replace this with your updated version, you
    need to create a new jmri.jar file from your modified code.  
    <P>
    To do this,
    ctrl-click (or right-click) on the name of the "JMRI" project in the
    "Projects" window.  This will open a pop-up menu, on which you'll
    find "Make Jar File". Select that, and a new jmri.jar file will be
    produced in the project's main directory.
    <p>Alternately, from the "Files" window, right-click on the build.xml file,
        and select "Run Target", then "jar".</p>
    
    <h2><a id="patch">Making a Patch File</a></h2>
    
    <p>A "diff patch file" is an easy way to gather up all your changes, even
    if they span multiple files, into one file that you can then send to us.
    It's also easy to merge in with the rest of the code, so we greatly 
    prefer that you use this.  If you have checked-out the SVN repository 
    using the first method shown above (i.e. without using a sourceforge.net
    user name and password), this is the best way to collect any code changes you 
    have for submission to the JMRI developer's team for inclusion in a future
    JMRI release.</p>
    
    <p>
    To create the "diff patch file":
    <ul>
 
    <li>From the [Team] menu, select "Export Diff Patch ..."
    <li>A file browser will open; enter a new file name
        in your preferred location and hit "Save" or "Open", 
        depending on what the dialog shows. 
    <li>After it finishes calculating the diffs, the file you selected will contain
        the patches, along with an information header.
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="nsis">Making a release package for Windows using NSIS</a></h2>

    <p>It is possible for NetBeans users to create a release package for use on 
        the Windows platform.  This requires installation of the Nullsoft Scriptable 
        Install System (NSIS), which can be downloaded from 
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis"> the NSIS project web site</a> 
        on SourceForge.</p>
    <p>Once NSIS is installed on the computer, it is necessary to create a file called
        local.properties in the same directory as JMRI's build.xml file.  This file is
        specifically <i>not</i> checked in via SVN, so that your machine-specific
        tool installation paths are <i>not</i> checked in to SVN.  Create the file, 
        and add a variable definition with the correct path to the directory which
        includes the NSIS executable, such as:</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">nsis.home=C:/Program Files (x86)/NSIS</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">nsis.home=/opt/nsis/nsis-2.46/</p>
    <p>If you will be installing a "findbugs" tool, you will also define findbugs.home
        in this file.  You may also define several other machine-specific and 
        user-specific information as described in various locations in the 
        build.xml file.</p>
    <p>With the NSIS package installed to your computer, and build.xml properly 
            modified, the Windows package may be created by running the 
            "package-windows" ant target in build.xml.</p>

    <h2><a id="findbugs">Running FindBugs</a></h2>

    <p>The FindBugs tool is a static code analysis tool which examines JAVA source code
        for common coding issues.  Installation of a FindBugs tool allows an ant task
        defined in build.xml to run FindBugs analysis across all of the JAVA source code
        in JMRI.</p>
    <p>It appears that the build.xml file is not configured to allow a NetBeans
        FindBugs "plugin" to run analysis on the JMRI code except on a one-file-at-
        a-time basis.  As such, it seems advisable to download and install the
        appropriate stand-alone FindBugs tool for your operating system.  FindBugs
        downloads may be found at <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net">the 
        FindBugs web site</a>.
    <p>Once you have the FindBugs tool installed, you must provide a path to the 
        directory containing the executable for use by the build.xml ant file.  
        If necessary, create the local.properties file in the same directory as 
        the JMRI build.xml file.  In the local.properties file, add the variable 
        findbugs.home with a path to the findbugs executable, such as:</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">findbugs.home=C:/findbugs-1.3.8</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">findbugs.home=/opt/findbugs-1.3.8</p>
    <p>To run the FindBugs tool on JMRI code, execute the ant target "findbugs" 
        which is defined in build.xml.  Within NetBeans this can be accomplished 
        by right-clicking build.xml in the "Files" pane and "Run"ing the "findbugs" 
        target.  When FindBugs completes, the NetBeans Output window will show 
        the path to a report file in HTML format.  Open that file with a browser 
        to review the FindBugs results.</p>        


        <h2><a id="compileIndividualFile">NetBeans and compiling individual files</a></h2>
        <p>The NetBeans IDE shows icons to the side of each object in the Projects window,
            and to the side of each file in the Files window.  These icons can reflect the
            status of each item, including local change and proper compilation status.</p>
        <p>At this time, the files (in the project's nbproject/ directory) which 
            control how NetBeans performs individual file compilation, do not properly
            reflect all of the requirements of the JMRI project.  <i>Until these files
            are properly updated, the error icons will persist within the JMRI project.</i>
            These error icons do <i>not</i> affect the ability of NetBeans to compile the 
            source files using the Ant tasks defined in the project's build.xml file.</p>
        <p>Building the JMRI .jar file, and executing a JMRI tool from within
            NetBeans is generally done via Ant tasks, which are defined in the project's
            build.xml file.  JMRI's developers have generally kept this file up-to-date,
            so building the JMRI .jar file, and executing a JMRI tool from within NetBeans
            generally does not suffer from the shortcomings of the configuration information
            found in the files in the project's nbproject/ directory.</p>
