  <h1>JMRI Code: Portable File Access</h1>
      <p>JMRI uses files for icons,
      images, panel files, scripts, and lots of other things.
      References to those are routinely used by various code, and
      stored in XML files. Some of the files are distributed with
      JMRI, and some are created outside the JMRI distribution
      directory by the local user.</p>

      <p>In addition, JMRI is a cross-platform application, and we
      want to be able to move JMRI XML files from one computer to
      another, even of a different type, and have them still
      work.</p>

      <p>To do this, we've created a system of pseudo-URLs for
      accessing file locations. Filenames are used internally and
      stored in XML files with prefixes that identify where the
      file is to be found in a system independent manner.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>program:</dt>
        <dd>Treats the path as a relative path below the JMRI installation directory.
          In JMRI 2.13.1 and earlier, this was the <code>resources:</code> prefix.</dd>

        <dt>preference:</dt>
        <dd>Treats the path as a relative path below the user files (or preferences)
          directory. In JMRI 2.13.1 and earlier, thie was the <code>file:</code> prefix.</dd>
          
        <dt>profile:</dt>
        <dd>Treats the path as a relative path below the configuration profile directory.</dd>
          
        <dt>settings:</dt>
        <dd>Treats the path as a relative path below the settings directory (the directory
          where per-computer preferences are stored).</dd>
        
        <dt>home:</dt>
        <dd>Treats the path as a relative path below the user's home directory.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      Otherwise, treat the name as a relative path below the
      program directory to provide backward compatibility. In any
      case, absolute pathnames will work, but won't be
      cross-platform compatible.

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      The <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/FileUtil.html">jmri.util.FileUtil</a>
      class provides translation routines to make this automatic:

      <dl>
        <dd>static public String getExternalFilename(String
        pName)</dd>

        <dt>Convert an internal name (with prefixes as above) into
        an absolute pathname for use on the local computer. There's
        no guarantee that the file or any enclosing directory is
        actually present, but the pathname will be syntactically
        valid on the present computer.</dt>

        <dd>static public String getPortableFilename(File
        file)</dd>

        <dd>static public String getPortableFilename(String
        filename)</dd>

        <dt>Convert a File or filename string into a string name
        with the appropriate prefix.</dt>
      </dl>
      <p>You should call getExternalFilename() before passing the
      filename to any Java common, and getPortableFilename()
      whenever you get a file or filename from a Java class. It's
      OK to call either one multiple times, as they'll just pass
      through in that case. In particular, call
      getPortableFilename() before storing to an XML file.</p>
