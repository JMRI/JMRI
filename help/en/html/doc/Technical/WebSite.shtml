This page discusses technical aspects of the JMRI web site.
<p>
If you just want to know how to make a small change to a web or
help page, please see the separate
<a href="webupdate/UpdatingDocs.shtml">page of instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>Structure of Information</h2>

<p>We distinguish between three types of information on the main web site:</p>
<ol>
<li>User information which is useful at run time.  
This is made available both via our <A HREF="Help.shtml">JavaHelp</a>,
and also directly by placing those files on the web.
<li>User information which is either not useful at run time, such as
instructions for installing the software, or is too large for inclusion
in releases, e.g. video clinics.
<li>Reference information from releases, such as decoder definitions, copies of scripts,
JavaDocs, etc.
</ol>

<p>We provide these separately:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run-time user information is made available by putting the help system
on the web site.
<li>Other user information is stored in Subversion as the
  <tt>trunk/jmri-website</tt> directory and
placed directly on the web site.
<li>Reference information is put on the web site from their own Subversion modules,
or created by automated Ant scripts during release builds.
</ol>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Page formatting is done using CSS, originally set up by John Plocher.
All pages should reference the CSS files for screen and printing
from the "/css" directory. This also means that you should leave the
formatting to the style sheets, and minimize the explicit formatting
that you do in HTML directly.</p>

<p>
Because we use our web pages in JavaHelp, there are some restrictions
on use of tags.  See our <a href="Help.shtml">JavaHelp web page</a> for more on this.</p>

<p>
We are using
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/ssi.html">server-side includes</a>
to provide consistent headers, sidebars and footers.
This allows us to share HTML
content between the web and the JavaHelp system
used by the program itself. Each page will contain just content,
plus includes for files named "Header", "Sidebar" and "Footer"
which contain the navigation information.
Eventually, all but a few index pages will have
".shtml" extensions. (The remaining index.html pages keep that name
so that people who request just a directory URL will be served something useful).</p>

<h2>Directory Organization</h2>

<p>The web site contains several separate areas, which translate to different 
SVN directories:</p>
<UL>
<LI>jython, resources, xml, web - these are taken directly from the
directories of the same name under <tt>trunk/jmri/</tt>. They are only occasionally referenced
directly.
<LI>help - from the Subversion module and JavaHelp system, this has the internal
structure described below and on our
<A HREF="Help.shtml">JavaHelp</a>
page.
</ul>
<p>The rest are from the <tt>trunk/jmri-website</tt>, and are checked out at 
the root of the web server.</p>
<ul>
<LI>releasenotes - Specific information on each test and production release
<LI>install - Information on how to install the JMRI software on various kinds of computers
<LI>community - Clinics, web pages, and other community-contributed information
<li>images - (Images used by web pages)
<li>contact - 
</ul>
<h2>Updating the jmri.org site</h2>

<p>Most of the web site contents is updated every 15 minutes from a job running on one of the
project's Jenkins build servers.  The directories listed above constitute most of the site,
and this content is updated from the SVN server without any additional work.</p>

<p>Some of the site is generated from the JMRI source itself, as opposed to being contained in 
the source.  The <a href="/JavaDoc/doc">JavaDoc</a> is one section, along with some of the 
information about the decoders available for use.  These updates, especially the JavaDoc, involve
significantly more work than merely updating a directory, and so they are performed nightly.</p>

<p>These steps are based upon checkins to the SVN repository -- the act of checking in modified
files is sufficient to trigger a web site update if it is necessary.</p>

<p>The status of the web site updates is available <a href="https://jmri.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Development/job/Web%20Site/">on this JMRI CI server</a>.</p>

<h2>Local Web Site: Mac OS X</h2>

<p>If you want to host a copy of the JMRI web site on your local
Mac OS X machine, follow these instructions to first configure
the Apache server to do server-side includes, and then make
a copy of the web site files available to the server.</p>

<OL>
<LI>You need to edit the Apache web server's configuration file. 
<ul>
<li>On Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), this is the /etc/httpd/httpd.conf file
<li>On Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and later, this is the /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file
</UL>
Once you've located the file, open it with your favorite
editor (You'll need to authenticate with the administrator password to 
modify this file). 
    <ul>
    <LI>
    To turn on server-side includes, find the section that 
    looks like
<PRE>
# This may also be "None", "All", or any combination of "Indexes",
# "Includes", "FollowSymLinks", "ExecCGI", or "MultiViews".
#
# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
# doesn't give it to you.
#
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
</PRE>
Add the word "Includes" to the last line so it looks like
<PRE>
    Options Includes Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
</PRE>
    
    <li>Now, configure the server to handle files with ".shtml" 
    extensions.  Find the section that looks like (the leading comment
    may be different):
<PRE>
    #
    # To use server-parsed HTML files
    #
    #AddType text/html .shtml
    #AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
</PRE>
    and un-comment the last two lines so that it looks like
<PRE>
    #
    # To use server-parsed HTML files
    #
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
</PRE>
    </ul>

<LI>To check out a copy of the files:
    <UL>
    <LI>Change to the web server directory
<PRE>
cd /Library/WebServer/Documents
</PRE>
    <LI>Check out the relevant files
<PRE>
# the trailing dot on the next line is important!
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/jmri/code/trunk/jmri-website .  
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/jmri/code/trunk/jmri/help 
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/jmri/code/trunk/jmri/jython
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/jmri/code/trunk/jmri/resources
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/jmri/code/trunk/jmri/web
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/jmri/code/trunk/jmri/xml
</PRE>
</UL>
<LI>Restart your computer to reinitialize the web server.
<LI>Test it by trying to display the URL
<A HREF="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>, 
which should get you a JMRI index page.
</OL>
