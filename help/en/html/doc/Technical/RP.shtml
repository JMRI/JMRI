      <h1>JMRI Code: Recommended Practices</h1>
      <p>This page contains miscellaneous info and pointers for JMRI
      developers.</p>

      <h2>Class Library Preferences</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>We use Java Swing for our GUI development. It's a lot
        more powerful than the original AWT, and the price is
        right. We have a recommended organization and usage pattern
        that's documented on <a href="Swing.shtml">another
        page</a>.</li>

        <li>JMRI uses the
        <a href="http://www.sparetimelabs.com/purejavacomm/purejavacomm.php">PureJavaComm libraries</a>
        to support serial
        communications on Macintosh, Linux and Windows.
        Before JMRI 4.7.5, we used the RXTX and
        SerialIO libraries for this, but these were then removed.</li>

        <li>Take a few moments to learn about the different
        types of <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/intro/">
        Java collections</a> that are available (
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html">List</a>,
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html">Deque</a>,
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">HashMap</a>, 
        etc) in the 
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html">java.util package</a>.
        Not everything needs to be an array! A 
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html">Deque</a>
        can be a good default solution to holding data that won't ever contain 'null'.
        </li>

        <li>JMRI uses <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/">
        Java generics</a> extensively to <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/">
        reduce errors and improve understanding</a>. With lots of
        people writing and sharing code, using generics instead of
        casts makes it much easier to understand the code, and
        allows the compiler to catch many misunderstandings about
        how things should be used. Most of the important
        information on them can be found on <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/">
        this page</a> from the Java Tutorial.</li>

        <li>If you need to use comma-separated variable (CSV)
        files, please use the <a href=
        "http://javacsv.sourceforge.net/">javacsv API</a> if
        possible. We are already using that in a number of places,
        and will probably use it in more. If that doesn't provide
        enough functionality, we might eventually move to the
        <a href=
        "http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/api/au/com/bytecode/opencsv/">
        opencsv API</a>, but since we only want to use one, the
        conversion will be a lot of work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Code Format</h2>The <a href=
      "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf">
      Java Code Conventions</a> (if that link is broken, try
      <a href=
      "https://web.archive.org/web/20080703230238/http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">
      this one</a> from the Internet Archive) for names,
      formatting, etc are really useful. If you find that you can't
      read a piece of code, these will help make it better.

      <p>Note that we have a few local conventions beyond those in
      the Java recommendations. You'll find them on other pages in
      this section, but for example, we recommend that you define
      the <a href="Logging.shtml">logger reference</a> at the
      bottom of each file.</p>

      <h2>Deprecating Code</h2>
      As development proceeds, sometimes
      old ways of doing things have to be replaced by new ways. In
      many cases, you can just change all the using code in our
      repository, and move forward. For general interfaces that
      might be used externally to JMRI, such as in scripts and
      CATS, it can be good to leave the old interface in place for
      a while, marking it as "deprecated" so that people can
      discover that it will eventually go away. After a suitable
      number of release cycles, the deprecated interface can then
      be removed.

      <p>Note that a deprecated interface is meant to still work.
      Deprecated should only mean that you can't count on the
      deprecated interface working in the future, so that it would
      be good to code away from it while it's still working.</p>

      <p>You may want to work with the deprecation checks "on"
      during compilation. To do that, change this line of
      build.xml:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
&lt;property name="deprecation" value="on" /&gt;
</pre>
      <p>This lets you pay attention to new deprecation warnings as
      you code.</p>

      <p>There are two forms of marking something as deprecated
      (Javadoc tag and Annotation), and both allow you to add
      additional information. A nice discussion of the
      technicalities is <a href=
      "http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/javadoc/deprecation/deprecation.html">
      here</a>. We use them this way:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
* @deprecated 2.7.8<br>
@Deprecated // 2.7.8<br>
</pre>
        where the line contains the version in which the deprecation
        is applied. That lets you easily know how long ago it was
        deprecated. 

    <h2>Exceptions</h2>
    
    SpotBugs will object to code like this:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  try {
     // do something here
  } catch (Exception e) {
  }
</pre>
with a 
<a href="http://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#rec-exception-is-caught-when-exception-is-not-thrown-rec-catch-exception"><code>REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION</code></a>
and/or a 
<a href="http://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#de-method-might-ignore-exception-de-might-ignore"><code>DE_MIGHT_IGNORE</code></a>
(less often 
<a href="http://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#de-method-might-drop-exception-de-might-drop"><code>DE_MIGHT_DROP</code></a>).
This is an example of two problems:
<ul>
<li>Catching <code>Exception</code> instead of more specific types
<li>Having nothing in the <code>catch</code> block
</ul>

Let's discuss those separately:

<h3>Catching the Exception class</h3>

There are two subcases here:
<ul>
<li>You're catching <code>Exception</code> because a lot of different specific things can be thrown, 
and it's a pain to write multiple <code>catch</code> blocks for each of those.  
That's actually obsolete thinking, though, because now there's syntax for combining those:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  try {
    // do something here
  } catch (IOException | JDOMException e) {
    // and do something, see below
  }
</pre>
That's a much better way to convey what this code is intended to do.

<li>You want to catch any unchecked exception, such as
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html"><code>NullPointerException</code></a>,
that is thrown.  Those are all subclasses of 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html"><code>RunTimeException</code></a>,
so the clean way to do this is to catch that:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  try {
    // do something here
  } catch (RunTimeException e) {
    // and do something, see below
  }
</pre>
</ul>

<h3>Empty catch block</h3>

What's an empty <code>catch</code> block trying to say?

<ul>
<li>Ideally, the code should handle the exception, in the sense of reacting to it so that the right stuff 
still happens for the user. So do that as a first strategy.
<p>
But sometimes, that's complicated, or the error is really something that isn't understood,
or perhaps is routine and doesn't matter.

<li>If you can't do anything else, at least consider logging that the code has caught something.  
Typically, this would be a warning:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
log.warn("can't do anything useful with this:", e);
</pre>
Adding the <code>Exception</code> object <code>e</code> to the log logs all its content, including the traceback. 
That way, if something weird happens later on, at least there's a clue in the log. 

<li>If it's really routine, log at <code>debug</code> or even <code>trace</code> level. 
That way if it turns out later to not actually be routine, turning on additional logging will help track it down.

<li>Consider <u>not</u> catching the error, so that it propagates up. 
(The methods for targeting the catch block more narrowly in the prior section can help here) 
It will eventually be caught, and will contain a more useful stach trace.  
This might require adding the exception to the signature of the current method so you can throw it upwards. 
<p>
Or, if absolutely can't change the signature, consider re-characterizing it, e.g.:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  try {
     // do something here
  } catch (IOException e) {
     // do something to clean upp
     ...
     // But still need to signal that this failed.
     // Let's blame the arguments we are processing:
     throw new IllegalArgumentException("couldn't process because ...", e);
  }
</pre>

<li>If it really is "ignore this, it's going to be OK", 
you should add an annotation so that others know why it's OK and don't have to worry about it in the future:
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressFBWarnings(value={"DE_MIGHT_DROP", "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE"}, 
    justification = "(Something about why this is OK)")
</pre>
</ul>
