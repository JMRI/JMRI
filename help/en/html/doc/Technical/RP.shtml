      <h1>JMRI Code: Recommended Practices</h1>

      <p>This page contains miscellaneous info and pointers for JMRI developers.</p>

      <h2>Class Library Preferences</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>We use Java Swing for our GUI development. It's a lot more powerful than the original
        AWT, and the price is right. We have a recommended organization and usage pattern that's
        documented on <a href="Swing.shtml">another page</a>.
        </li>

        <li>JMRI uses the <a href=
        "http://www.sparetimelabs.com/purejavacomm/purejavacomm.php">PureJavaComm libraries</a> to
        support serial communications on Macintosh, Linux and Windows. Before JMRI 4.7.5, we used
        the RXTX and SerialIO libraries for this, but these were then removed.
        </li>

        <li>Take a few moments to learn about the different types of <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/intro/">Java collections</a> that are
        available ( <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html">List</a>, <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html">Deque</a>, <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">HashMap</a>, etc) in the
        <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html">java.util
        package</a>. Not everything needs to be an array! Only use a <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Vector.html">Vector</a> when there's a
        specific reason for it such as compatibility with an existing API; they're slow and
        memory-intensive compared to e.g. an <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>. A
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html">Deque</a> can be a
        good default solution to holding data that won't ever contain 'null'. Consider using a
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html">TreeSet</a> for
        data that's best kept in some sorted order; there's are very few good reasons for sorting
        data during normal running in JMRI. If none of these are adequate, consider incorporating a
        specialized collection type from <a href=
        "http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/">Apache Commons Collections</a>
        instead of rolling your own.
        </li>

        <li>JMRI uses <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/">Java
        generics</a> extensively to <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/">reduce errors and improve
        understanding</a>. With lots of people writing and sharing code, using generics instead of
        casts makes it much easier to understand the code, and allows the compiler to catch many
        misunderstandings about how things should be used. Most of the important information on
        them can be found on <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/">this
        page</a> from the Java Tutorial.
        </li>

        <li>Enums, added in Java 5, are a better way of representing N selections than using
        integer constants. The entire idea is to <u>not</u> have them be just another form of
        Integer or String, so don't provide methods to convert them from or to Integer (int) or
        String. If you need to provide an ordering or comparison, add a public method to the enum
        to do that; it can work with the internal structure of the enum without exposing it.</li>

        <li>If you need to use comma-separated variable (CSV) files, please use the <a href=
        "https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/">Apache Commons CSV API</a> if possible. We
        are already using that in a number of places, and will probably use it in more. If that
        does not provide enough functionality, we might eventually move to the <a href=
        "http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/">opencsv API</a>, but since we only want to use one, the
        conversion will be a lot of work.
        </li>

        <li>We currently don't use the Java <code>assert</code> keyword in our production code. (We
        use the <a href="JUnit.shtml">JUnit Assert in testing</a>, but that's different). We may
        use it in the future, but for now please <a href="Logging.shtml">log a message at the Error
        level</a> if you encounter an internal consistency problem during normal operation; if
        there's no way to continue, <code>throw new AssertionError("description");</code> as that's
        a step toward our eventually figuring out how to use Java assertions in such cases.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="collections">Collections</h2>
      Take a few moments to learn about the different types of <a href=
      "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/intro/">Java collections</a> that are
      available ( <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html">List</a>,
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html">Deque</a>, <a href=
      "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">HashMap</a>, etc) in the
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html">java.util
      package</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>Please don't use fixed-size arrays for holding variable sized data in objects. That
        generally ends up wasting huge amounts of space at runtime, and we try to keep the JMRI
        memory footprint small when we can.</li>

        <li>Only use a <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Vector.html">Vector</a> when there's a
        specific reason for it such as compatibility with an existing API; they're slow and
        memory-intensive compared to e.g. an <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>.
        </li>

        <li>A <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html">Deque</a>
        can be a good default solution to holding data that won't ever contain 'null'.
        </li>

        <li>Consider using a <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html">TreeSet</a> for data
        that's best kept in some sorted order; there's are very few good reasons for sorting data
        during normal running in JMRI. If you also need random access (e.g. "The 5th element")
        consider <a href=
        "http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/com/dictiography/collections/IndexedTreeSet.html">
          IndexedTreeSet</a> and <a href=
          "http://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/com/dictiography/collections/IndexedTreeMap.html">
          IndexedTreeMap</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="format">Code Format</h2>
      The <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf">Java Code
      Conventions</a> (if that link is broken, try <a href=
      "https://web.archive.org/web/20080703230238/http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">this one</a>
      from the Internet Archive) for names, formatting, etc are really useful. If you find that you
      can't read a piece of code, these will help make it better.
      <p>Note that we have a few local conventions beyond those in the Java recommendations. You'll
      find them on other pages in this section, but for example, we recommend that you define the
      <a href="Logging.shtml">logger reference</a> at the bottom of each file.</p>

      <h2 id="deprecating">Deprecating Code</h2>
      As development proceeds, sometimes old ways of doing things have to be replaced by new ways.
      In many cases, you can just change all the using code in our repository, and move forward.
      For general interfaces that might be used externally to JMRI, such as in scripts and CATS, we
      prefer to leave the old interface in place for a while, marking it as "deprecated" so that
      people can discover that it will eventually go away. (The current list of those is available
      as <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/deprecated-list.html">part of the Javadocs</a>) The
      sequence is then:
      <ol>
        <li>Write the new methods.</li>

        <li>Mark the old methods with both @deprecated and @Deprecated (see below).
            The associated Javadoc comment should
            tell people where to find the replacement.
          <p>Note that if you mark an interface or super-class (i.e. abstract) class or method as
          deprecated, you should also mark all implementations of it as deprecated. That way, they
          won't themselves show as deprecated usages to fix, but code that uses them will.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Start generating warnings for users (especially scripting users) by adding:

<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
            jmri.util.Log4JUtil.deprecationWarning(log, "myMethod()");
</pre>
          to the start of each deprecated method. This will put a warning in the log if that method is used during
          normal operation.
        </li>

        <li>Remove all uses in JMRI code, except tests, of these deprecated classes and/or
        methods until the deprecations report during compilation is clean. Tests are
        kept to make sure the code keeps working until the code is removed.
            <p>In rare cases, this might not be practical.  In that case you can add
            a line like
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
            @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")  // Thread.stop
</pre>
            just before the usage. The comment is required. It should indicate
            the name of the deprecated member being used.
            <p>
            We also use lines like this when using deprecated Java methods and
            deprecated methods from external libraries to indicate we know that
            we're doing it, and to add them to the technical backlog
            <a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/deprecations/">tracked by Jenkins</a>.

          <p>If you have tests for that method (you should!) you may need to modify the direct
          tests of the deprecated method; see the
          <a href="JUnit.shtml#deprecationWarning">instructions on the JUnit page</a>.
          </p>

        </li>

        <li><strong>Don't forget to migrate the Jython sample scripts!</strong>
        </li>

        <li>These changes can then be included in the next test release.
        As soon as possible, you should PR them so that people get notice of the
        deprecations. Make sure that the PR includes something for the release note about the
        deprecations to draw people's attention.</li>

        <li>Traditionally, we wait for four production releases (two years) before
        removing major/public deprecated methods and their tests. Implementation
        methods can be removed earlier, perhaps after two production releases (one year).
        (Truely internal methods don't need to go through this process at all; just remove them)
        When you do remove the deprecated code, make sure that the PR to do this
        includes an update to the release note about the removal; if it's a significant
        change, consider adding something to the warnings section.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Note that a deprecated item is meant to still work. Deprecated should only mean that you
      can't count on the deprecated item working in the future, so that it would be good to code
      away from it while it's still working.</p>

      <p>There are two forms of marking something as deprecated in the code: Javadoc @deprecated tag and the @Deprecated annotation.
      Both allow you to add additional information. A nice discussion of the technicalities is
      <a href=
      "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/deprecation/deprecation.html">here</a>
      with additional discussion
      <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/forward-looking-with-javas-deprecated">here</a>.
      We strongly recommend using both of them like this:</p>

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
/**
 * (Other Javadoc comments)
 * @deprecated As of 5.3.1, use {@ link #foo()} instead
 */
@Deprecated(since="5.3.1")
</pre>
        where the comment and <code>since</code> parameter contain the version in which the deprecation is applied.
        That lets the user easily know how long ago it was deprecated.
        <p>
        You can add a <code>forRemoval=true</code> clause to @Deprecated.  We encourage
        you to do that once there are no references in the JMRI code. It will make the deprecation
        much more visible to people who attempt to use it because it defeats @SuppressWarnings.


      <h2 id="exception">Exceptions</h2>

      <h3>Throwing Exceptions</h3>
      When checking inputs (i.e. for valid parameter values) and you find a problem, what should
      you do?
      <ul>
        <li>You can throw an unchecked exception. IllegalArgumentException is a great example: Most
        of the time it doesn't really have to be thought about. It's rare to explicitly try/catch
        for it. When an IllegalArgumentException (or whatever) is thrown, it works up to some
        high-level handler, where there will be some default handling (usually just logging) it,
        and the various libraries will get a chance to clean things up.</li>

        <li>You can thrown a checked exception, i.e. a JmriException subclass or some on-target
        Java checked exception class. This forces all writers of method-using code to think about
        how to handle problems. They might wrap with a try-catch or just declare it to go upward,
        but they have to think about it.</li>

        <li>Don't use error codes or other "check the return value" approaches. They just make it
        likely there will be invisible problems that bite people in complicated ways (because you
        can ignore them, leaving junk behind)</li>
      </ul>
      Generally, JMRI developers tend to throw an unchecked exception, i.e.
      IllegalArgumentException or similar.
      <h3>Catching Exceptions</h3>
      SpotBugs will object to code like this:

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  try {
     // do something here
  } catch (Exception e) {
  }
</pre>with a <a href=
"http://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#rec-exception-is-caught-when-exception-is-not-thrown-rec-catch-exception">
      <code>REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION</code></a> and/or a <a href=
      "http://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#de-method-might-ignore-exception-de-might-ignore">
      <code>DE_MIGHT_IGNORE</code></a> (less often <a href=
      "http://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#de-method-might-drop-exception-de-might-drop">
      <code>DE_MIGHT_DROP</code></a>). This is an example of two problems:
      <ul>
        <li>Catching <code>Exception</code> instead of more specific types</li>

        <li>Having nothing in the <code>catch</code> block</li>
      </ul>
      Let's discuss those separately:
      <h4 id="catch">Catching the Exception class</h4>
      There are two subcases here:
      <ul>
        <li>You're catching <code>Exception</code> because a lot of different specific things can
        be thrown, and it's a pain to write multiple <code>catch</code> blocks for each of those.
        That's actually obsolete thinking, though, because now there's syntax for combining those:

          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  try {
    // do something here
  } catch (IOException | JDOMException e) {
    // and do something, see below
  }
</pre>That's a much better way to convey what this code is intended to do.
        </li>

        <li>You want to catch any unchecked exception, such as <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html"><code>NullPointerException</code></a>,
        that is thrown. Those are all subclasses of <a href=
        "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html"><code>RunTimeException</code></a>,
        so the clean way to do this is to catch that:

          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  try {
    // do something here
  } catch (RunTimeException e) {
    // and do something, see below
  }
</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="empty">Empty catch block</h4>
      What's an empty <code>catch</code> block trying to say?
      <ul>
        <li>Ideally, the code should handle the exception, in the sense of reacting to it so that
        the right stuff still happens for the user. So do that as a first strategy.
          <p>But sometimes, that's complicated, or the error is really something that isn't
          understood, or perhaps is routine and doesn't matter.</p>
        </li>

        <li>If you can't do anything else, at least consider logging that the code has caught
        something. Typically, this would be a warning:

          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
log.warn("can't do anything useful with this:", e);
</pre>Adding the <code>Exception</code> object <code>e</code> to the log logs all its content,
including the traceback. That way, if something weird happens later on, at least there's a clue in
the log.
        </li>

        <li>If it's really routine, log at <code>debug</code> or even <code>trace</code> level.
        That way if it turns out later to not actually be routine, turning on additional logging
        will help track it down.</li>

        <li>Consider <em>not</em> catching the error, so that it propagates up. (The methods for
        targeting the catch block more narrowly in the prior section can help here) It will
        eventually be caught, and will contain a more useful stack trace. This might require adding
        the exception to the signature of the current method so you can throw it upwards.
          <p>Or, if absolutely can't change the signature, consider re-characterizing it, e.g.:</p>

          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  try {
     // do something here
  } catch (IOException e) {
     // do something to clean upp
     ...
     // But still need to signal that this failed.
     // Let's blame the arguments we are processing:
     throw new IllegalArgumentException("couldn't process because ...", e);
  }
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>If it really is "ignore this, it's going to be OK", you should add an annotation so
        that others know why it's OK and don't have to worry about it in the future:

          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressFBWarnings(value={"DE_MIGHT_DROP", "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE"},
    justification = "(Something about why this is OK)")
</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="Optional">Use of Optional</h2>
      The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html">Optional</a>
      class is the right way to provide "a method return type where there is a clear need to
      represent 'no result,' and where using <code>null</code> is likely to cause errors". There's
      some good background on use of Optional in an <a href=
      "https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/12-recipes-for-using-the-optional-class-as-its-meant-to-be-used">
      introductory Java Magazine article</a>. There's more info about how <code>null</code> makes
      errors likely is dicussed in a <a href=
      "https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/java8-optional.html">related
      article</a>. As Tony Hoare - one of the giants of computer science - wrote, "I call it my
      billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. I couldn't resist
      the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement."
