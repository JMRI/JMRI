      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>This is an automated system designed to enable you to run trains using the Dispatcher
      system between locations (normally sidings or stations, but really any set of blocks)
      designated by yourself.</p>

      <p>Provided you have set up a system as described in System Requirements, by pressing a few
      buttons on theSystem Generation Panel, a complete system will be set up for you complete with
      Transits, Train Info files, and buttons for you to press which will route trains across your
      layout.</p>

      <p>A network will be set up behind the scenes which will find the best route from the train's
      location to the required location, and set in place a set of transits which will guide the
      train to the required location.</p>

      <p>The train will either stop at all stations on the route, or travel without stopping at
      intermediate stops, depending on whether express or stopping mode is selected</p>

      <p>Provision is made for multiple train operation, the trains stopping for each other. This
      is a feature of Dispatcher, but the system allows easy selecting of each train to control
      each one.</p>

      <h3 id="steps">Steps in setting up the system</h3>

      <p>There are several stages to set up the system for automatic train running:</p>

      <p>Fulfil the prerequisites, which include having speed profiled your locos that you wish to
      run with the system</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start JMRI with no panel displayed.</li>

        <li>The panel should have:
          <ul>
            <li>SignalMasts</li>

            <li>SignalMast Logic</li>

            <li>No Transits (if there are any they will be deleted)</li>

            <li>No Train Info Files (if there are any they will be deleted)</li>

            <li>SignalMasts</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Bring up the Dispatcher System Panel</li>

        <li>Run Stage1 to generate an intermediate panel with icons to move trains</li>

        <li>Restart</li>

        <li>Run Stage2 to generate a run system panel</li>

        <li>Restart</li>

        <li>Run Stage3 to check the dispatcher options</li>

        <li>Check the system logic produced automaticlly and modify by hand</li>

        <li>Save in a modified run panel</li>

        <li>Run the train</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>

      <p>To use the Dispatcher System there are several prerequisites</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You should have set up the system with signal masts</li>

        <li>The locos you want to run on the system should be:
          <ul>
            <li>entered in the Roster</li>

            <li>set up with a speed profile</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>the required stopping places (blocks) should be indicated by entering stop in the
        comments field for the appropriate block</li>

        <li>Provision is made for a station announcement to be made when a train departs from a
        station.</li>

        <li>If the block name is unpronounceable, a good stop name can be entered in the comments
        field for the departure announcements</li>

        <li>Typical blocks comments would be</li>

        <li><img src="images/NewItem31.png" alt="">
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="stage1">Running Stage1 &mdash; Editing the panel</h2>

      <p>Run DispatcherSystem.py in the main jython directory. You will get something like
      this:</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem3.png">
      </p>

      <p>You are prompted to run Stage1 which adds all the icons required to run the system on a
      new panel.</p>

      <p>if the old panel name was WR.xml, the new panel will be WR_icons.xml</p>

      <p>Some checks are done first</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem4.png">
      </p>

      <p>The following checks are made</p>

      <ul>
        <li>All blocks have a sensor</li>

        <li>No two blocks have the same sensor</li>

        <li>stops are set up</li>

        <li>all blocks have lengths</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If no trains are present in the roster with speed profiles, this will be picked up, and
      can be corrected at run time.</p>

      <p>When the icons file is produced, a message similar to the following will be produced:</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem34.png">
      </p>

      <p>A new panel has been created. You should close down and load the new panel, instead of the
      original.</p>

      <p>Note:</p>

      <p>The panel will have been created by loading the original xml file (in this case WR.ml),
      editing the details and saving to a new file (WR_icons.xml).</p>

      <p>If there were any unsaved edits in the original file these will not be present in the new
      file, but you will not lose them provided you save them either to the original file or
      another file once Stage1 has completed. We advise saving all edits before running Stage1, so
      they are picked up.</p>

      <h2 id="stage2">Running Stage2 Producing the signal logic, transits and train info files</h2>

      <p>PanelPro should be restarted and the icons file produced in stage 1 should be loaded.</p>

      <p>A screen similar to the following will be produced:</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem6.png">
      </p>

      <p>Once the Stage2 button is pressed one gets a confirmatory messages:</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem55.png">
      </p>

      <p>The signal logic is produced, then the following confirmatory message appears:</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem7.png">
      </p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem8.png">
      </p>

      <p>Transits required to move the train from stop to stop will be produced, and corresponding
      train-info files which contain the information required for running the train are produced.
      Some of the information is overwritten when the train-info files are used such as the train
      name, so train info files do not have to be produced for each train.</p>

      <p>Train-info files are produced for each route allowed, and all routes are allowed which are
      physically possible to travel. Train-info files are produced for forward and reverse
      operation, so there can be quite a number produced.</p>

      <p>Once the transits and train-info files are produced we get a message:</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem35.png">
      </p>

      <p>You should then restart JMRI and load the run panel instead of the icons panel, in this
      example WR_run.xml</p>

      <h2 id="stage3">Running Stage3 Final Checks</h2>

      <p>Restart JMRI and load the newly produced run panel, in our example WR_run.xml</p>

      <p>Run dispatcher System again to get</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem11.png">
      </p>

      <p>Click Stage3 and one gets two screens opening,the Dispatcher options screen and another
      saying the options that need to be set for the Dispatcher system to work</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem12.png">
      </p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem13.png">
      </p>

      <p>Set the required option and we get a message reminding you to save the changed options</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem14.png">
      </p>

      <p>Select the dispatcher window that has opened automatically and click =&gt; Save
      Options</p>

      <p><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="images/NewItem32.png">
      </p>

      <h2 id="runningprogram">Running the Program</h2>

      <p>To run the system it is advised to have the thread monitor running (Panels =&gt; Thread
      Monitor)</p>

      <p>You will notice several buttons in the top RH corner.</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem38.png" alt="NewItem38">
      </p>

      <p>The first two start and end the threads required for the program to run. The threads need
      to be in operation for the other buttons to work. The threads can be viewed by clicking
      Panels | Thread Monitor on the PanelPro Window.</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem40.png" alt="NewItem40">
      </p>

      <p>To run the system the following needs to be set up</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Place a train on the layout. If you wish to simulate the train to get an idea of how
        the system will operate click the bottom left button of a station which will make the
        station occupied.</li>

        <li>Register the train with the dispatcher system telling the system what way it s facing
        so the system knows what trainsit to use to move the train (forwards or backwards). Press
        the 'Setup Train in Section' button to do this.</li>

        <li>&nbsp;Set up a dispatch. This can be done in several ways.
          <ol>
            <li>Click the Run Dispatch Button and click a station button and specify which
            registered train will move towards that station</li>

            <li>Setup a Route and run the route. A Route consists of a path joining several
            stations. The stations joined can be anywhere on the layout no matter how far apart
            they are, and the system will find valid paths between the stations.The station buttons
            can be used to either setup a dispatch or setup a route depending upon whether "Setup
            Route or "Run Dispatch" is selected. The route is run by pressing the "Run Route"
            button.</li>

            <li>Setup routes, Setup Scheduled Trains and then start the scheduler.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>If a physical train is on the layout at the start of the dispatch the train should
        move. If you have just made the block occupied with no physical train you can press the
        'Simulate the Dispatched Train' button to get an idea of how the train will run. The train
        will simulate much quicker than a real train and takes no account of the train length.</li>

        <li>Announcements can be activated by pressing the 'Enable Announcements' button. This is
        off by default as they can get a but irritating.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Press the run button. The Express Train and the Run Dispatch options will be highlighted
      and the run Dispatch option will cause the following prompt to be displayed:</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem39.png" alt="NewItem39">
      </p>

      <h2 id="RegisteraTrain">Register a Train</h2>

      <p>The first step is to register a train in a siding or at a stop. If you are simulating the
      system to see whether it will work before running trains you may press the bottom left hand
      small button which will make the section occupied. Drive a train to the required stop, and
      press Setup Train in Siding.</p>

      <p>We need to tell the system which way the train is pointing.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>At a siding it's easy there is one direction the train can go, and we say which way it
        is facing out of the siding</li>

        <li>At another stop we have to indicate which way we are talking about and we highlight one
        direction</li>
      </ul>

      <p>suppose we have the following layout</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem16.png" alt="NewItem16" width="617" height="140">
      </p>

      <p>Choosing the Train</p>

      <p>We click SetupTrain in siding</p>

      <p>If the train is siding 1b as indicated one gets the following message</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem17.png" alt="NewItem17">
      </p>

      <p>Where if we click the dropdown we get all the trains in the system with a speed profile.
      We choose the required train and click OK</p>

      <p>Register the Direction the train is facing</p>

      <p>The following message then pops up</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem18.png" alt="NewItem18">
      </p>

      <p>Select the correct direction and click OK.</p>

      <p>The train will appear in the memory location for the block</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem20.png" alt="NewItem20" width="629" height="140">
      </p>

      <h2 id="Setupadispatch">Set up a dispatch</h2>

      <p>To set up a dispatch a train (or several trains bust be registered with the system, and
      located in a stop).</p>

      <p>Clicking a red button will allow a dispatch to be set up to that location.</p>

      <p>Suppose one has the following layout with a train in siding1. Click the Passing Loop
      button as indicated to set up a dispatch to Passing Loop.</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem24.png" alt="NewItem24" width="681" height="304">
      </p>

      <p>There is an express icon. If set the train type will default to express (moves without
      stopping at intermediate stations), If unset, will default to stopping as shown.</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem26.png" alt="NewItem26">
      </p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem25.png" alt="NewItem25">
      </p>

      <p>Select the required train from the drop down, and a dispatch will be set up to the next
      stop (Siding1A).</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem27.png" alt="NewItem27" width="692" height="157">
      </p>

      <p>The train will start moving, and the speed indicated in the Auto trains window.</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem28.png" alt="NewItem28">
      </p>

      <p>The train will move to Siding1B, stop and the dispatch will terminate, another dispatch
      will start up to the next stop which will be to passing loop.</p>

      <h2 id="SetupaRoute">Setup a Route</h2>

      <p>Click 'Setup Route'. The following message will be displayed:</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem41.png" alt="NewItem41">
      </p>

      <p>You now press the red section (station) buttons to set the route. The first button will be
      the start of the route.</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem46.png" alt="NewItem46">
      </p>

      <p>The subsequent buttons will be the intermediate stations. At each station you will be
      asjked:</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem44.png" alt="NewItem44">
      </p>

      <p>You will be told what station you have selected and be asked whether to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>select another station</li>

        <li>select no more stations and complete the route</li>

        <li>cancel</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you press complete route, a route will be automatically set up with the name being the
      amalgam of the start station and the end section. If a route already exists with that name,
      an index will be appended. The name of the route can be changed bu clicking the 'View / Edit
      Route' button or the View Route button on the pop-up.</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem45.png" alt="NewItem45">
      </p>

      <h2 id="RunRoute">Run Route</h2>

      <p>To run a route a route must already have been set up. Click Run Route</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem47.png" alt="NewItem47">
      </p>

      <p>You will be prompted with all the routes you have set up</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem48.png" alt="NewItem48">
      </p>

      <p>Choose the required route and click OK.</p>

      <p>If you have no train in a station registered with the system, or all trains registered are
      being dispatched you will get the following message:</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem49.png" alt="NewItem49">
      </p>

      <p>Put a train in a station, register it and try again. In the below example we have one
      train available 'Class 20'</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem50.png" alt="NewItem50">
      </p>

      <p>You will then get the following message:</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem51.png" alt="NewItem51">
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Stop at End of Route: The train will travel from its current position to the start of
        the route, travel along the route, then stop</li>

        <li>return to start position: The train will travel from its current position to the start
        of the route, travel along the route, then return to the start position</li>

        <li>return to start position and repeat: As (2) but repeat forever</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="ScheduleRoute">Schedule Route</h2>

      <p>To store the routes we have used the mechanism provided by Operations which normally
      provides instructions to move trains manually. To schedule the trains we use the scheduling
      mechanism of Operations.</p>

      <p>To check that we have some routes setup we press 'View/Edit Routes'.</p>

      <p>To schedule these routes we press 'View/Edit Scheduled Trains'. Here we have set up 3
      trains to be scheduled.</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem42.png" alt="NewItem42" width="770" height="181">
      </p>

      <p>To setup a new train press 'Add...'. To see the route press Edit for the particular train.
      For instructions on how to set up the trains you can l ook at the help for Operations which
      can be seen by pressing Help | Window Help.</p>

      <p>The mechanism is quite straightforward and you probably can setup the train without any
      further help.</p>

      <p>On Add train you will get the following pop-up</p>

      <p><img src="images/NewItem43.png" alt="NewItem43">
      </p>

      <p>Note that you have to fill in</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Train Name (this is arbitrary. The actual train that will run is the train sitting in
        the start position of the route</li>

        <li>Description (this can be left blank, but if the following key words are entered (any
        order) they will have the following effect
          <ol>
            <li>skip : the train will be ignored when scheduling takes place</li>

            <li>repeat : the train will go along the route, then repeat forever</li>

            <li>stopping : the train will normally go direct from station to station on the route.
            Stopping will cause the train to stop at any station it passes on the route</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>All other entries can be ignored as the Dispatcher System does not use them.</p>

      <h2 id="running">Run scheduled trains</h2>

      <p>If the trains have been scheduled in the Operations scheduler as described above pressing
      the 'Start Scheduler' button will start the scheduler at a midnight on a fast clock 1 times
      the normal speed.</p>

      <p>If you wish to change the start time (trains may start later) or wish to change other
      parameters press Set scheduler start time.</p>

      <p>I recommend changing the fast clock to 10 times normal speed, and the fast clock time to
      whatever you require, but at least a few minutes before the first train to be scheduled.</p>

      <p>You may wish to view the fast clock. I like the analog clock so there is a button 'Show
      Analog Clock', but if you wish to see another clock change the code or use the menu on
      PanelPro | Tools | Clocks.</p>

      <p>To start the scheduler press 'Start Scheduler' and the clock will start and the trains set
      up to be dispatched will start when the fast clock gets to the correct time.</p>

      <h2 id="FeaturesSystem">Features of the Dispatcher System</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>The Dispatcher system is designed to run trains from station to station. The system has
        been set up with a network graph which allows the system to get the shortest path between
        two stations, and this is used to get the route between the two stations. At present if a
        train is in a station en route, the system will not re-route to avoid the train, and the
        train may get stuck. Care must be taken when running trains.</li>
