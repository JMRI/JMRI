      <h1><a name="_Toc194074955"></a>Setting up the System to Dispatch a Train</h1>
      <h2><a name="_Toc194074956"></a>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Dispatcher System is designed to enable you to run trains between locations (normally sidings or stations, but really any set of blocks) designated by yourself.</p>
      <p>Provided you have set up a system as described in System Requirements, by pressing a few buttons on the System Generation Panel, a complete system will be set up for you complete with Transits, Train Info files, and buttons for you to press which will route trains across your layout.</p>
      <p>A network will be set up behind the scenes which will find the best route from the train's location to the required location and set in place a set of transits which will guide the train to the required location.</p>
      <p>The train will either stop at all stations on the route, or travel without stopping at intermediate stops, depending on whether express or stopping mode is selected.</p>
      <p>Provision is made for multiple train operation, the trains stopping for each other. This is a feature of Dispatcher, but the system allows easy selection of each train to control each one.</p>
      <h2><a name="_Toc194074957"></a><a name="_Toc167983231"></a><a name="_Toc168507346"></a>Setting up the System - Summary</h2>
      <p>There are two stages to set up the system for automatic train running:</p>
      <h3><a name="_Toc194074958"></a>Stage 1: Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>Fulfil the prerequisites, which include having speed profiled your locos that you wish to run with the system</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Start JMRI with a panel loaded.</li>
        <li>The panel should have: </li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>SignalMasts. Do not use Signal Heads. This is an alternative way of setting up signals and Dispatcher system will not work with them.</li>
          <li>Signal Masts should be placed on all potential section boundaries.</li>
          <li>No Sections. Sections will be created using the signals, and any existing sections will be deleted.</li>
          <li>No SignalMast Logic (if there is any they will be deleted and replaced)</li>
          <li>No Transits (if there are any they will be deleted and replaced)</li>
          <li>No Train Info Files (if there are any they will be deleted and replaced)<br /> <br /> </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>In other words there is a lot of stuff that you would ordinarily need to set up to use Dispatcher, that you don&rsquo;t need to using Dispatcher System</p>
      <p>In addition the block table should have been edited to indicate the blocks where the train should stop</p>
      <p>These requirements are explained in detail below.</p>
      <p>You will be using Sensors and Signal Masts. In order for these to work properly, people usually set up a start of day operation. As a quick way of getting the system working you can put two routines in the startup file in properties, which can be found in the scripts area</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>SetAllTurnoutsClosed.py and</li>
          <li>SetAllUnknownSensorsToInactive </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>If you use these be sure to load the panel before calling these in the startup routines, else they will not work. It is also useful to put a button on the startup screen calling the dispatcher system file in the same directory</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>DispatcherSystem.py</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h3><a name="_Toc194074959"></a>Stage 2: Setting up the System</h3>
      <p> To run Dispatcher System:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Bring up the Dispatcher System Panel</li>
        <li>Run Stage1 to generate everything to run Dispatcher between stations</li>
        <li>Run Stage2 to check the dispatcher options</li>
        <li>Run the trains using the commands on a newly produced command panel</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="_Toc194074960"></a><a name="_Toc168507347"></a>Prerequisites - Details</h2>
      <p>To use the Dispatcher System there are several prerequisites</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>You should have set up the system with signal masts.</li>
        <li>The locos you want to run on the system should be: </li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>entered in the Roster</li>
          <li>set up with a speed profile</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>the required stopping places (blocks) should be indicated by entering stop in the comments field for the appropriate block</li>
        <li>Provision is made for a station announcement to be made when a train enters a station.</li>
        <li>If the block name is unpronounceable, a good stop name can be entered in the comments field for the departure announcements</li>
        <li>Typical blocks comments would be</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Run DispatcherSystem.py in the main jython directory. You will get something like this:</p>
      <p><img src="DispatcherSystem_files/image003.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer
Description automatically generated" width="681" height="288" border="0" /></p>
      <p>You are prompted to run Stage1 which adds all the icons required to run the system on a new pane, and generates transits</p>
      <p>If the old panel name was WR.xml, the new panel will be backed up to WR_backup_xx.xml where _xx is an incremental number which is added if previous backups exist</p>
      <p>Some checks are done first, we check that:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>All blocks have a sensor</li>
        <li>No two blocks have the same sensor</li>
        <li>stops are set up</li>
        <li>all blocks have lengths</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If all checks pass we get a message:</p>
      <p><img src="DispatcherSystem_files/image004.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer screen
Description automatically generated" width="454" height="133" border="0" /></p>
      <p>Further details of the checks can be viewed if required. If the checks do not pass details of the errors are given.</p>
      <p>If no trains are present in the roster with speed profiles, this will be picked up at run time, and can be corrected then.</p>
      <p>The following items are then produced automatically, with countdown timer showing the progression</p>
      <p>&middot;A backup of the existing panel </p>
      <p>&middot; The changes to the panel with the stopping points and stopping sensors </p>
      <p>&middot;&nbsp;The signal logic to operate the signals </p>
      <p>&middot;&nbsp;The required sections </p>
      <p>&middot;&nbsp;The transits and train info files required to move trains between stopping points </p>
      <p><img src="DispatcherSystem_files/image005.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer error

      <p>The first two (run and stop dispatcher system) start and end the threads required for the program to run. The threads need to be in operation for the other buttons to work. </p>
      <p>While operating the dispatcher system, if you have the thread monitor running (Panels =&gt; Thread Monitor) you can monitor what processes are running.</p>
      <p>The thread monitor will look like the following once the system is started</p>

      <p>The first step is to register a train in a siding or at a stop. If you are simulating the system to see whether it will work before running trains you may press the bottom left hand small button which will make the section occupied. Drive a train to the required stop, and press Setup Train in Siding.</p>

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>At a siding it's easy there is one direction the train can go, and we say which way it is facing out of the siding</li>

      <p>Actions are python files which may be run at stations. A (very) few action files are provided in the Dispatcher System, and other files may be added. The provided files are in the jython/DispatcherSystem/actions folder in JMRI. It is best not to add new files there since they will be wiped out when a update is installed. Instead use them as a guide, and add them in the userfiles directory (see directories in preferences) in the folder dispatcher/actions. If the actions folder does not exist, create it.</p>
      <p>Suppose we are selecting stations when setting up a route and get the following menu:</p>

      <h2><a name="_Toc194074983"></a>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Trains can be scheduled to run at specific times over routes. In the schedule table the trains on the routes are set to run at specific start times. They can then be set to run just at that time or at intervals based on that start time, say every 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>The running period per day can be set from say 4am to 11pm, and the fast clock set to a rate within that period, and optionally at a faster rate outside that period (during the night).</p>
      <p>Timetables can be set up to display the schedules trains, For timetables to work the start time of each station on each route that is scheduled needs to be set up. This can be done manually or automatically, the latter by running a train over he route using a special routine.</p>
      <p>Timetables can be displayed locally on the computer running JMRI, or on remote computers/tablets communicating via MQTT usually over a local network.</p>
      <p>The schedules are set up from the Dispatcher panel. At the bottom of the panel you see the following screen.</p>

      <p>The duration is defined as the time the train takes to travel between the previous station and the current station plus the wait time in the station. It is displayed in real seconds and fast minutes. The departure time is calculated automatically from the durations (and vice-versa). </p>
      <p>We can either enter the journey times in real seconds, or the durations in fast minutes</p>
      <p>We could now run a train over the route, measure the time taken, and enter the durations in fast minutes. Alternatively, you can note the time the train arrives at the station, and add a bit to allow the train to wait. </p>
      <p>For example we enter 3 and 5 for the durations in fast minutes and toggle journey/wait times to get:</p>

      <p>You may find like the example above that the station names are rather cryptic, and not names that you would want to appear on a timetable. Looking at the diagram you see that CornerUp and Corner Down are two platforms at one place Walden. It would be nice to display the trains going in each direction on one timetable with the name Walden, and show what platform each train stops at. To do this the details for Walden had been filled in under station group, and the platform details under platform.</p>

      <h3><a name="_Toc194075006"></a>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Communication between the main computer and the tablets takes place using MQTT and Node Red,</p>
      <p>To display a timetable on a remote tablet or computer screen, we need to:</p>
      <p>1) Set up the required MQTT environment using Mosquitto and Node Red on a local or remote computer</p>
      <p>2) Set up a local or remote network connection</p>
      <p>3) Setup a MQTT connection in JMRI</p>
      <p>4) Generate the MQTT Node Red Code</p>
      <p>5) Import the code to node red, and perform a trivial edit</p>
      <p>6) Get the appropriate page on a browser to display the timetable</p>
      <p>These timetables were inspired by a Rocrail MQTT implementation and modified from that implementation. The Rocrail implementation and hence the JMRI Node Red implementation is licenced as follows:&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en">CC Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International</a>.</p>

      <p>DownLinePlatform and UpLinePlatform are terminus stations (with a traverser at the end hence the continuations to the left). There is no easy way to set up a Traverser at the moment under Dispatcher, though it can be done with points and some Logix),<br /> <br /> Consider the situation where trains are in Down and UpLinePlatforms. We are in the UK where trains travel on the left, and the train in UplinePlatform wants to move to DownlinePlatform, where it will pick up passengers before travelling in SP-MLU direction. To do this it will travel to SP-MLU and then to UplinePlatform.</p>
      <p>If there is a train in UplinePlatform, this train will be trapped by the train in SP-MLU. To avoid this we need a rule, do not go on the journey UplinePlatform &ndash; SP-MLU &ndash; DownLinePlatform if there is a train in DownLinePlatform.</p>

      <h1><a name="_Toc194075026"></a>Keeping a Scheduled System Running</h1>
      <p>Inevitably when running trains using a scheduled system a fault will occur such as a train being derailed. It is not enough to place the train in the correct position as the system has knowledge about the direction of the train and its transit which may be disrupted. A simple tool is provided to mitigate these errors.</p>
      <p>If the derailed train is dragged to the end of the transit, the transit may stop, but usually the train will go off in the wrong direction. If the train is removed and placed down in at the start of the next transit, the current transit may not complete.</p>
      <p>Suppose we are running a schedule with a route which includes a transit for train J94 Saddle Tank Amazon and the train gets derailed in block FY7 (fiddle yard 7) which is the large red highlighted block. </p>
