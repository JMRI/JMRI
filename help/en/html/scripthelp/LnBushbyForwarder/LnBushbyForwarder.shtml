      <h1>LocoNet "Bushby" Forwarder</h1>

      <p><span class="since">Since <a href="https://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri4.25.2.shtml" target=
      "_blank">JMRI 4.25.2</a></span>
      </p>

      <p>The <code>LnBushbyForwarder.py</code> script provides a mechanism to selectively convert
      the "normal" LocoNet turnout control messages, for selected turnout addresses, into "special"
      LocoNet turnout control messages. This script may be useful in cases where a Digitrax command
      station is configured with its "Bushby" feature enabled.</p>

      <p>Such "special" messages can be important if any hardware <strong>gets its turnout control
      messaging from either the DCC track signal <em>or</em> the "RailSync" wires on the LocoNet
      cable</strong>. The "Busbhy" feature, when enabled, <strong>prevents</strong> the command
      station from forwarding "normal" LocoNet turnout commands to the DCC track signal (and the
      RailSync signals). The net result is that a LocoNet agent, including throttles, will be
      _unable_ to control any accessory devices which get their control messages from the DCC track
      signal (or the Railsync signals), <em>unless</em> they are capable of sending the special
      LocoNet turnout control messaging. Since <em>most</em> LocoNet devices are not able to send
      the special turnout control messaging, most LocoNet devices will <strong>not</strong> be able
      to control those accessories.</p>

      <p>This script provides a mechanism which watches for "normal" LocoNet switch control
      messages, and, for certain user-configurable LocoNet switch addresses, sends the equivalent
      "special" LocoNet switch control message. The command station recognizes those special
      LocoNet switch control messages and forwards the appropriate DCC packet to the DCC track
      signal (and RailSync signals).</p>

      <h2>What this script does</h2>
      The <code>LnBushbyForward.py</code> script, in the <code>jython</code> directory of the JMRI
      program installation, provides a mechanism which will monitor LocoNet for "normal" turnout
      control messages, and, selectively, send the corresponding "special" turnout control message,
      if appropriate.
      <p>In the context of this script, "selectively", and "appropriate", as used above, means a
      check of the "normal" LocoNet turnout control message's turnout address, against a list of
      turnout addresses:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>if the normal turnout control message is for an address in the list, then a special
        turnout control message will be generated and sent to LocoNet, or</li>

        <li>if the normal turnout control message is for an address which is not in the list, then
        the script ignores the message.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Configuring the script</h2>
      As written, the script is designed to generate "special" turnout control messages <em>only
      for</em> "normal" LocoNet turnout control messages for addresses <strong>10, 11, 12,
      13</strong>. The list may be updated to meet the needs of your specific situation by changing
      the list which is coded in the line:<br>
      <code>toBeForwarded = [10, 11, 12, 13]</code><br>
      As an example, if you wish the script to generate "special" turnout control messages for
      turnout addresses 5, 21, 76, 45, and 33, then the following line would be appropriate:<br>
      <code>toBeForwarded = [5, 21, 76, 45, 33]</code><br>
