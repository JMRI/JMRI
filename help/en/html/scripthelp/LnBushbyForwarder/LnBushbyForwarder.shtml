      <h1>LocoNet "Bushby" Forwarder</h1>
      <p><span class="since">Since
          <a href="https://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri4.24.9.shtml" target="_blank">
      JMRI 4.24.9</a></span></p>
      <p>The <code>LnBushbyForwarder.py</code> script provides a mechanism to
          selectively convert the "normal" LocoNet turnout control messages, for 
          selected turnout addresses, into "special" LocoNet turnout control
          messages.  This script may be useful in cases where a Digitrax command 
          station is configured with its "Bushby" feature enabled.
      <p>Such "special" messages can be important if any hardware <strong>gets its
          turnout control messaging from either the DCC track signal <em>or</em>
          the "RailSync" wires on the LocoNet cable</strong>.  The "Busbhy" 
          feature, when enabled, <strong>prevents</strong> the command
          station from forwarding "normal" LocoNet turnout commands to the DCC 
          track signal (and the RailSync signals).  The net result is that a LocoNet
          agent, including throttles, will be _unable_ to control any accessory 
          devices which get their control messages from the DCC track signal (or
          the Railsync signals), <em>unless</em> they are capable of sending the 
          special LocoNet turnout control messaging.  Since <em>most</em> LocoNet
          devices are not
          able to send the special turnout control messaging, most LocoNet devices
          will <strong>not</strong> be able to control those accessories.
          <p>This script provides a mechanism which watches for "normal" LocoNet 
          switch control messages, and, for certain user-configurable LocoNet switch
          addresses, sends the equivalent "special" LocoNet switch control message.
          The command station recognizes those special LocoNet switch control messages
          and forwards the appropriate DCC packet to the DCC track signal (and 
          RailSync signals).
      <h2>What this script does</h2>
      The <code>LnBushbyForward.py</code> script, in the <code>jython</code> 
      directory of the JMRI program installation, provides a mechanism which will
      monitor LocoNet for "normal" turnout control messages, and, selectively, send
      the corresponding "special" turnout control message, if appropriate.
      <p>In the context of this script, "selectively", and "appropriate", as used
      above, means a check of the "normal" LocoNet turnout control message's 
      turnout address, against a list of turnout addresses:
      <ul>
          <li>if the normal turnout control message is for an address in the 
          list, then a special turnout control message will be generated and 
          sent to LocoNet, or</li>
          <li>if the normal turnout control message is for an address which is 
          not in the list, then the script ignores the message.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Configuring the script</h2>
      As written, the script is designed to generate "special" turnout control 
      messages <em>only for</em> "normal" LocoNet turnout control messages for 
      addresses <strong>10, 11, 12, 13</strong>.  The list may be updated 
      to meet the needs of your specific situation by changing the list 
      which is coded in the line:<br>
      <code>toBeForwarded = [10, 11, 12, 13]</code><br>
      
      As an example, if you wish the script to generate "special" turnout control
      messages for turnout addresses 5, 21, 76, 45, and 33, then the following 
      line would be appropriate:<br>
      <code>toBeForwarded = [5, 21, 76, 45, 33]</code><br>
