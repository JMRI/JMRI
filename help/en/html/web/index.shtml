      <h1>JMRI Web Access</h1>

      <p>JMRI can provide web access to your model railroad.</p>

      <h2><a id="Start" name="Start">Starting Web Access</a></h2>

      <p>Before attempting to use web access, please make sure that
      the basic configuration of your JMRI application is working.
      Check that you can properly communicate with and operate your
      layout.</p>

      <p>Start web access by selecting "Start JMRI Web Server"
      under the "Tools" menu.</p>

      <p>Test the connection:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you're using a Bonjour/Zeroconf-enabled web browser
        like Safari you should see a "My JMRI Railroad" web site in
        the "Bonjour" tab.</li>

        <li>Otherwise, enter the starting URL, which will be
        something like "http://192.168.1.7:12080" (or if you're
        browsing on the same computer right now, <a href=
        "http://localhost:12080">click here</a>. The default port
        is 12080, but this can be changed in Web Server
        Preferences. You should see a welcome screen, which serves
        as the home page for the JMRI web server. This page (by
        default) contains a number of useful examples and
        links.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a id="Configure" name="Configure">Configure Web
      Access</a></h2>

      <h3>Automatically start</h3>

      <p>JMRI can automatically start the web server when
      launched.</p>

      <p>Open the <a href=
      "../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Preferences
      Window</a> to configure JMRI to start the server each time
      you start the program.</p>

      <p>Select the "Start Up" tab, click "Add &#9662;", and select
      "Perform action...". In the new selection box that appears,
      select "Start Web Server". Don't forget to save your
      changes!</p>

      <h2>Web Server Preferences</h2>

      <p>Web Server Preferences are in two categories:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Web Server</dt>

        <dd>
          <dl>
            <dt>Port#</dt>

            <dd>The port the web server listens for HTTP requests.
            This defaults to 12080. You may need to change this
            value if another program expects to be listening on
            this port as well. Some Anti-Virus services use this
            port.</dd>

            <dt>Disable power control in menus</dt>

            <dd>The menus on many of the JMRI web pages include a
            layout power button. You can disable this button to
            ensure that users of the web site can see the power
            status, but cannot turn off or turn on layout
            power.</dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>

        <dt><a href="FrameServlet.shtml">Frame Server</a></dt>

        <dd>
          <dl>
            <dt>Disable Frames</dt>

            <dd>Disable the frame server. Disabling the frame
            server disables most other preferences. The frame server
            is disabled by default.</dd>

            <dt>Use Panels Instead</dt>

            <dd>If the frame server is disabled, requests for
            frames can be redirected to <a href=
            "PanelServlet.shtml">panels</a>.
            Redirection to panels is enabled by default.</dd>

            <dt>Click Delay</dt>

            <dd>Wait the specified number of seconds after a click
            on the window (frame) image before refreshing the
            image.</dd>

            <dt>Refresh Delay</dt>

            <dd>The number of seconds before the window image is
            automatically refreshed.</dd>

            <dt>Use Ajax?</dt>

            <dd>Use features that improve performance on modern
            browsers. Turn off to support obsolete browsers.</dd>

            <dt>Disallowed Frames</dt>

            <dd>A list of windows that will not be displayed in the
            browser.</dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2><a id="services" name="services">Services</a></h2>

      <p>JMRI Web Access provides a number of web services.</p>

      <p><em>All links below assume you are currently using a web
      browser on the same computer you are running JMRI on and that
      JMRI is using the default port 12080.</em></p>

      <p>JMRI Web Access home page at <a href=
      "http://localhost:12080">http://localhost:12080</a> provides
      direct access to all of the web services. Most JMRI web
      access pages provide direct access to the <a href=
      "#panels">panels</a>, <a href="#roster">roster</a>, and
      <a href="#operations">operations</a> services.</p>
      <!-- don't mention the servlets at all, just mention the services provided by the servlets -->

      <h3><a id="panels" href="PanelServlet.shtml" name=
      "panels">Panels</a></h3><!-- panelServlet intro -->

      <p>Loaded JMRI panels can be used in a modern web browser on
      computers, smart phones, and tablets. A list of the loaded
      panels is at <a href=
      "http://localhost:12080/panel">http://localhost:12080/panel</a>.</p>

      <h3><a id="roster" name="RosterServlet.shtml">Roster</a></h3>
      <!-- rosterServlet intro -->

      <p>The web roster at <a href=
      "http://localhost:12080/roster">http://localhost:12080/roster</a>
      provides a list of roster entries. Clicking on an entry will
      open the web throttle for that entry.</p>

      <h3><a id="throttle" name="throttle">Throttles</a></h3>
      <!-- webThrottle intro -->

      <p>JMRI supports using a modern browser on a smart phone,
      tablet, or other computer as a throttle device at <a href=
      "http://localhost:12080/web/webThrottle.html">http://localhost:12080/web</a>
      (see <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/webThrottle/webThrottle.shtml">Web
      Throttle Help</a>).</p>

      <h3><a id="operations" href="Operations.shtml" name=
      "operations">Operations</a></h3>
      <!-- operationsServlet intro -->

      <p>Operations services at <a href=
      "http://localhost:12080/operations">http://localhost:12080/operations</a>
      are at the proof of concept stage. Currently the conductor
      view is complete, but other operations views are missing or
      are works in progress.</p>

      <h3><a id="frames" href="FrameServlet.shtml" name=
      "frames">Windows</a></h3><!-- frameServlet intro -->

      <p>JMRI can display most <em>already open</em> windows as a
      somewhat usable image to allow partial remote control of
      JMRI.</p>

      <p>The list of viewable windows is at <a href=
      "http://localhost:12080/frame">http://localhost:12080/frame</a>.
      Please note that not all open windows are viewable. See
      <a href="FrameServlet.shtml">Window Services</a> for more
      information.</p>

      <h3><a id="files" name="files">File System</a></h3>
      <!-- fileServlet intro -->

      <p>A local web page (HTML file), graphic or text file, or
      directory listing can be displayed using the appropriate
      URL.</p>

      <p>Files in your JMRI preferences directory can be accessed
      via a URL path that starts with "/prefs": <a href=
      "http://localhost:12080/prefs/">http://localhost:12080/prefs/</a></p>

      <p>Files in certain directories in the JMRI program directory
      can be accessed via a URL path that starts with "/dist":
      <a href=
      "http://localhost:12080/dist/help/en/webindex.shtml">http://localhost:12080/dist/help/en/webindex.shtml</a>
      will reference the index to the help system, while <a href=
      "http://localhost:12080/dist/resources/logo.gif">http://localhost:12080/dist/resources/logo.gif</a>
      will load a JMRI logo graphic from the resources directory.
      "/dist/web" and "/dist/xml" also work as prefixes.</p>

      <p>Note that if a directory contains a file named
      <code>index.html</code> it will display the contents of the index.html file
      instead of listing the directory contents.</p>

      <h3><a id="json" href="JsonServlet.shtml" name="json">JSON
      Protocol</a></h3><!-- JsonServlet intro -->

      <p>JMRI provides a JSON Protocol to access and manipulate for
      a number of JMRI-defined entities. See the <a href=
      "JsonServlet.shtml">JMRI JSON Protocol</a> for more
      information.</p>

      <h2><a id="custom" name="custom">Customizing Web
      Access</a></h2>

      <p>If you create a directory <code>web</code> in your User
      Files directory, configuration profile root directory, or
      settings directory, any file in that directory that has the same
      name and directory hierarchy as a file the <code>web</code>
      directory in the JMRI distribution directory will override
      the default file used for that purpose. This provides the
      ability to replace images, scripts, and other content with
      personal content.</p>

      <p>The standard web services use templates in the web/servlet
      directory. Note that these templates are tightly linked with
      JMRI. While modifying these templates is the recommended way
      to customize the web access, care must be taken to ensure
      modifications do not cause the templates to break entirely.
      If web access does not work as expected after modifying a
      template, check the JMRI logs for the cause.</p>

      <h2><a name="redirection" id="redirection">Request
      Redirection</a></h2>

      <p>Some requests are automatically redirected by one of the JMRI web
          services to ensure that old bookmarks or software can still be used:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>/index.html</dt>

        <dd>Redirects to <code>/</code> since the static HTML root
        was replaced with a dynamic HTML root.</dd>

        <dt>/prefs/index.html</dt>

        <dd>Redirects to <code>/</code> since the static HTML root
        was replaced with a dynamic HTML root. Some WiThrottle
        clients refuse to allow access to the web server if a
        request to <code>/prefs/index.html</code> returns an
        error.</dd>

        <dt>/prefs/roster.xml</dt>

        <dd>Redirects to <code>/roster?format=xml</code> since
        users can opt to have the roster outside the normal
        preferences file location, and the <a href=
        "RosterServlet.shtml">roster servlet</a> can load the
        roster from any location.</dd>

        <dt>/web/operationsConductor.html</dt>

        <dd>Redirects to <code>/operations</code> since this page
        was replaced with the <a href="Operations.shtml">operations
        servlet</a>.</dd>

        <dt>/web/operationsManifest.html</dt>

        <dd>Redirects to <code>/operations</code> since this page
        was replaced with the <a href="Operations.shtml">operations
        servlet</a>.</dd>

        <dt>/web/operationsTrains.html</dt>

        <dd>Redirects to <code>/operations</code> since this page
        was replaced with the <a href="Operations.shtml">operations
        servlet</a>.</dd>

        <dt>/web/showPanel.html</dt>

        <dd>Redirects to <code>/panel</code>.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2><a id="security" name="security">Security</a></h2>

      <p>By default, JMRI only allows limited access to your
      computer. Only files that are located within the JMRI
      distribution directory or the JMRI preferences directory will
      be provided in response to requests. This is not air-tight
      security, however, and you should be careful to not put
      important content in those directories or link them to other
      parts of your computer.</p>
