        <h1>JMRI: Storing Your Work</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">What Everyone Should Know</p>
        
      <p class="noted">This page provides the basic informaiton you should know about what commands are used to store the
      data you create and update in JMRI. A companion page with more information for advanced users about when, how, and where JMRI
      stores data is available <a href="DataManagement.shtml"> here.</a></p>
        
      <p>JMRI's model for creating, updating, and storing (or discarding) the information it needs to perform its various functions
      depends on which JMRI function you are dealing with. Certain kinds of data are handled completely automatically. Others are
      created by you and updated by JMRI.  For still others, you have the ability to control whether or not to change or keep that
      data from one run of JMRI to the next. For example, saving changes to roster entries is separate from storing away your 
      layout configuration.</p>
      
      <p>Unfortunately, JMRI does not always notify you if there is unsaved data when it exits (although the community of developers
      is constantly working to improve this).  For example, when you create a Sensor in the Sensor Table, it will appear in the Sensor
      Table Window, but it will be gone if you close JMRI - unless you take one of the actions listed below to save it.</p>
      
      <p>To ensure that data you create (or is created and updated for you) is kept as you require, you should 
      understand when and how the different kinds of data get saved to a disk file, or not, and, in the case of CVs, to your locomotives
      and other DCC decoders.  This page is intended to give you the basic information you need to know.</p>

      <p>So make sure your hit "Save" and "Store" for all the different tools you use within JMRI and you will always have
      what you worked on the next time.  And if there is a problem, remember that JMRI keeps backup files when it writes
      your data to permanent storage, either automatically or by your command, so look for files with the ".bak" suffix
      and you'll be able to recover from most missteps.</p>

     <p class="important"><strong>Lost Panels:</strong> An issue commonly reported on <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers" target="_blank">the JMRI
      user forum</a> is that panels have disappeared on restarting PanelPro and opening a panel file.  Often, this is because someone selected "Store configuration"
      rather than "Store configuration and panels" and overwrote an existing panel file.  Don't panic - the backup copy (in the directory
      "backupPanels" in the <a href="../doc/Technical/ProfileFileStructure.shtml#userfilesloc">User Files Location</a>) is there.  Best 
      practice in working with PanelPro is to almost always use "Store configuration and panels" or "Store Panels..." where it appears,
      and to rename the file you are saving so you have multiple versions named by you to go back to if necessary.</p>

     <h2>Things that are NOT stored after you quit JMRI</h2>
      <div class="para">      
 
      <p>Some data you will create during your JMRI session or that will be created via communication with your layout is <em>NOT</em> saved
      after you quite JMRI.  This is normal as this data represents the current state of your trains and layout (e.g. turnout position) so
      requires feedback from you or your layout.  These transitory data are:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Sensor state</li>
       <li>Turnout state</li>
       <li>DispathcerPro Trains</li>
