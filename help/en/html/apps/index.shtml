      <h1>JMRI: Applications</h1>

      <p>JMRI provides several applications that are optimized for
      specific purposes. You can of course also <a href=
      "../doc/Technical/index.shtml#writecode">write your
      own</a>.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>
          <a href="./DecoderPro/index.shtml">DecoderPro&reg;</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>A better tool for programming decoders. DecoderPro
        simplifies the job of configuring complicated DCC decoders
        by providing screens on which you can select the various
        options and values you want.<br>
        Open DecoderPro by double clicking its icon in the JMRI
        installation folder.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="./PanelPro/index.shtml">PanelPro&trade;</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Operating CRT based CTC control panels that reflect the
        real-time state of your railroad <em>and</em> let you
        control it - almost like a Prototype dispatcher!<br>
        Open PanelPro by double clicking its icon in the JMRI
        installation folder.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="./DispatcherPro/index.shtml">DispatcherPro&trade;</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>A system for Dispatching, grouping your Roster and
        Throttles.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/operations/Operations.shtml">OperationsPro&trade;</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Create Train Manifests that detail the work your train
        crews will perform during an operations session. The
        Manifest lists of car pick up and set outs, shows where the
        cars are located, and provides the cars' destinations.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="./SoundPro/SoundPro.shtml">SoundPro</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>A set of tools for using Audio with JMRI.<br>
        Open SoundPro by double clicking its icon in the JMRI
        installation folder.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Additional Applications with JMRI Connections...</h2>
       <p>Hobbyists have created applications that work with JMRI
       to provide extra capabilities. In addition, some commercial vendors have
       created applications that work with, add data to, or take data from JMRI</p>
       <p>See the <a href="../../../../community/connections/CommunityConnectionsIndex.shtml">
       community/connections directory</a> for a list and links.  
       New applications can be added at any time!</p>
       
     
      <h2>JMRI Features and Tools</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>JMRI provides many <a href="../tools/index.shtml">features and tools</a> 
        to set up and operate your layout that are shared across most JMRI applications.  You can
        find additional information about each by clicking through the links in the sidebar or the 
        <a href="../tools/index.shtml">tools index page.</a></li>

        <li>In addition to the common tools, there are many <a href=
        "../tools/index.shtml#systemSpecificTools">system-specific
        tools</a> that are available within most of the JMRI applications.  You can find additional information
        about each by clicking through the links in the <a href="../tools/index.shtml#systemSpecificTools"> system-specific
        tools index page</a>.  The tools themselves are invoked from their own menu pulldowns within 
        the JMRI applications when  you have JMRI configured for each specific System Connection.</li>
