      <h1>JMRI: Applications</h1>

      <p>JMRI provides several applications that are optimized for
      specific purposes. You can of course also <a href=
      "../doc/Technical/index.shtml#writecode">write your
      own</a>.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>
          <a href="./DecoderPro/index.shtml">DecoderPro&reg;</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>A better tool for programming decoders. DecoderPro
        simplifies the job of configuring complicated DCC decoders
        by providing screens on which you can select the various
        options and values you want.<br>
        Open DecoderPro by double clicking its icon in the JMRI
        installation folder.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="./PanelPro/index.shtml">PanelPro&trade;</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Operating CRT based CTC control panels that reflect the
        real-time state of your railroad <em>and</em> let you
        control it - almost like a Prototype dispatcher!<br>
        Open PanelPro by double clicking its icon in the JMRI
        installation folder.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="./DispatcherPro/index.shtml">DispatcherPro&trade;</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>A system for Dispatching a model railroad.  The ability to
        automatically run trains is a popular feature.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="./OperationsPro/index.shtml">OperationsPro&trade;</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Create Train Manifests that detail the work your train
        crews will perform during an operations session. The
        Manifest lists of car pick up and set outs, shows where the
        cars are located, and provides the cars' destinations.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="./SoundPro/SoundPro.shtml">SoundPro</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>A set of tools for using Audio with JMRI.</dd>

      <h2 id="addapp">Additional Applications with JMRI Connections...</h2>
       <p>
       Hobbyists have created applications that work with JMRI
       to provide extra capabilities. In addition, some commercial vendors have
       created applications that work with, add data to, or take data from JMRI</p>
       <p>See the <a href="../../../../community/connections/CommunityConnectionsIndex.shtml">
       community/connections directory</a> for a list and links.
       New applications can be added at any time!
       </p>

      <h2 id="jythonapp">Jython Applications for JMRI...</h2>
       <p>
       Some JMRI users have implemented sophiticated capabilities using the <a href="../tools/scripting/index.shtml">JMRI jython scripting facilities.</a>  These are listed
       <a href="../tools/scripting/JythonApps.shtml">here</a>.
      </p>


      <h2>JMRI Features and Tools</h2>

        <p>JMRI software consists of a large library of functions divided into</p>

        <ul>
          <li>a system-specific part, with many subparts, each of which communicates with one
          supported hardware system, like C/MRI, in a system specific way, and</li>
          <li>a system-independent part where most of the features of JMRI are implemented.</li>
         </ul>


         <p>So, for example, if the user does something (perhaps setting a route) to
          cause JMRI to throw a Turnout (track switch), that user action will occur in
          the system-independent part of the software, and then JMRI will send out the
          actual command via the system-dependent part appropriate to the hardware
          system controlling the particular Turnout thrown. JMRI is designed so that
          features are implemented in the system-independent part as much as possible,
          with JMRI using system-dependent subparts only when really necessary. Access
          to system-independent features is via the main JMRI menus, such as the Tools
          menu.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>You can
            find additional information about each of the JMRI "common" tools by clicking through the links in the sidebar or the
            <a href="../tools/index.shtml">tools index page.</a></li>

            <li>There are many <a href=
            "../tools/index.shtml#systemSpecificTools">system-specific
            tools</a> that are available within the JMRI applications. You can find additional information
            about each by clicking through the links in the <a href="../tools/index.shtml#systemSpecificTools"> system-specific
            tools index page</a>.  The tools themselves are invoked from their own menu pulldowns within
            the JMRI applications when  you have JMRI configured for each specific System Connection.</li>

          </ul>
