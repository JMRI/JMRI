      <p class="subtitle">What Everyone Should Know</p>

      <p class="noted">This page provides the basic information you should know about what commands
      are used to load and store the data you create and update in JMRI. A companion page with more
      information for advanced users about when, how, and where JMRI stores data is available
      <a href="DataManagement.shtml">here.</a></p>

      <div class="noted">
        <span class="since">since 4.23.3</span>
        <p>The main PanelPro menu has changed as of JMRI release 4.23.3.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Panels &rArr; Load Panels...</strong> has moved to <strong>File &rArr; Load table
          content and panels...</strong></li>

          <li><strong>Panels &rArr; Store Panels...</strong> has moved to <strong>File &rArr; Store ALL table
          content and panels...</strong></li>

          <li><strong>Panels &rArr; Show History</strong> has moved to <strong>File &rArr; Show file
          history</strong></li>

          <li><strong>Panels &rArr; Run Script...</strong> has moved to <strong>Scripting &rArr; Run
          Script...</strong></li>

          <li><strong>Panels &rArr; Thread Monitor</strong> has moved to <strong>Scripting &rArr; Thread
          Monitor</strong></li>

          <li><strong>Panels &rArr; Script Output</strong> has moved to <strong>Scripting &rArr; Script
          Output</strong></li>

          <li><strong>Panels &rArr; Script Entry</strong> has moved to <strong>Scripting &rArr; Script
          Entry</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The text for the panel and table specific File menus is now consistent.</p>

        <p>The panel <strong>Close</strong> button <strong>hides</strong> the panel. It can be
        shown using the Window menu or <strong>Panels &rArr; Show Panel</strong>. To delete a panel, use
        the panel's delete option in the panel's File menu or the new <strong>Panels &rArr; Delete
        Panel...</strong> menu item.</p>

        <p>The menu paths shown below are the new paths. The old paths are shown in braces.</p>
      </div>

      <p>JMRI's model for creating, updating, and storing (or discarding) the information it needs
      to perform its various functions depends on which JMRI function you are dealing with. Certain
      kinds of data are handled completely automatically. Others are created by you and updated by
      JMRI. For still others, you have the ability to control whether or not to change or keep that
      data from one run of JMRI to the next. For example, saving changes to roster entries is
      separate from storing away your layout configuration.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, JMRI does not always notify you if there is unsaved data when it exits
      (although the community of developers is constantly working to improve this). For example,
      when you create a Sensor in the Sensor Table, it will appear in the Sensor Table Window, but
      it will be gone if you close JMRI - unless you take one of the actions listed below to save
      it.</p>

      <p>To ensure that data you create (or is created and updated for you) is kept as you require,
      you should understand when and how the different kinds of data get saved to a disk file, or
      not, and, in the case of CVs, to your locomotives and other DCC decoders. This page is
      intended to give you the basic information you need to know.</p>

        <p>So make sure your hit <strong>"Save"</strong> and <strong>"Store"</strong> for all the
        different tools you use within JMRI and you will always have what you worked on the next
        time. And if there is a problem, remember that JMRI keeps backup files when it writes your
        data to permanent storage, either automatically or by your command, so look for files with
        the ".bak" suffix, and you'll be able to recover from most missteps.</p>

        <p><a href="#TopOfPage">[Go to top of page]</a>

        <p class="important"><strong>Lost Panels:</strong> An issue commonly reported on <a href=
        "https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">the JMRI user forum</a> is that panels have disappeared on
        restarting PanelPro and opening a panel file. Often, this is because someone selected
        "Store Only table content (No Panels)... {Store configuration}" rather than "Store ALL
        table content and panels... {Store configuration and panels}" and overwrote an existing
        panel file. Don't panic - the backup copy (in the directory "backupPanels" in the <a href=
        "../doc/Technical/ProfileFileStructure.shtml">Profile Location</a>) is there. Best practice
        in working with PanelPro is to almost always use <strong>"Store ALL table content and
        panels...</strong> {<em>Old: <strong>Store configuration and panels</strong></em>}" or
        <strong>"Store ALL table content and panels...</strong> {<em>Old: <strong>Store
        Panels...</strong></em>}" where it appears, and to rename the file you are saving, so you
        have multiple versions named by you to go back to if necessary.  <strong><em>As of 4.99.4,
        the option to store without panels has been removed.</em></strong></p>
