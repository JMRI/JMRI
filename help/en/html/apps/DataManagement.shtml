      <p class="noted">This page includes information intended for advanced users of JMRI. Basic
      information on commands to load and store your work is available <a href=
      "LoadStoreWork.shtml">here</a>. The additional information on the current page is
      not necessary for ordinary, day-to-day use of JMRI but may be of interest to those who want
      to understand in more detail when, how, and where JMRI stores the data you and the system
      create and update.</p>

      <p>As you work with JMRI, you will create and update many different items within JMRI's various
      applications and tools. You may also develop and run "scripts" (external programs) that will
      do that as well. JMRI will update some of these at certain points during train operation.
      Although JMRI tries to hide lots of technical details from you, some model railroaders want
      to know how things work: what data is created when you take various actions, when it gets
      updated by the JMRI programs, and also whether it gets saved once you quit JMRI and come back
      at another time. This page provides a reference guide to all JMRI data, how it gets created
      and updated, when it gets saved (some doesn't!), and, for more advanced users, where it gets
      stored.</p>

      <p>We want to stress that this is <span class="co">additional technical detail</span>. You
      should not need to know this for normal operation of the programs. If you find that you do,
      perhaps there's something going wrong, and before reading this page you should ask for help
      on the <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/">JmriUsers group</a> or elsewhere.</p>

      <p>The <a href="#category">Elements by Category</a> table columns show the following
      information:</p>

      <p><strong>Category:</strong> The tables below categorize the different types of JMRI data to
      make this information easier to present and hopefully to understand. These categories are
      shown in the column labelled <strong>"Category"</strong>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Layout Elements: all the things that describe my layout and how it works, such as
        turnouts, tracks, pictures there of, blocks, signals, etc.). All this information is
        entered in <a href="PanelPro/index.shtml">PanelPro</a>.
        </li>

        <li>Roster Information: roster entries for each of your engines and other DCC controlled
        accessories, pictures of engines, the roster itself, and related information. Roster
        information is entered in <a href="DecoderPro/index.shtml">DecoderPro</a>.
        </li>

        <li>Operations Elements: data related to operating your railroad (manually or with some
        degree of automation) such as warrants, paths, and dozens of other things. Operational
        elements are entered in various "Tools" listed in PanelPro including <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">"Dispatcher..."</a>.
        </li>

        <li>System Preferences: all the things you enter under Preferences, either in DecoderPro or
        PanelPro.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Creates/Stores:</strong>When it comes to saving what you input and/or what JMRI
      does with that input, there are multiple different situations, shown in the table column
      <strong>"Creates/Stores"</strong>. There is data that is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>User created, user stored (e.g. turnout table entries, layout panels, connections,
        start-up preferences)</li>

        <li>User created, automatically stored (e.g. size and position of windows, roster entries
        when change made to the roster table)</li>

        <li>Automatically created, user stored (e.g. Logix from LRoute)</li>

        <li>Automatically created, automatically stored (e.g. default profile)</li>

        <li>Automatically created, not stored! (e.g. turnout status)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The key to successful operation with JMRI is understanding which is which. And that is
      what the tables below will show you.</p>

      <p><strong>Save Command:</strong>Unfortunately, there is no single command to save all user
      created or modified data. It is important to recognize when and where you have to take some
      action to make sure your work is there the next time you come back to it. As the table shows
      in the column labelled <strong>"Save Command"</strong>, these are the places where a command
      to "save" or "store" will save and store some portion of your work:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Preferences: "Save"</li>

        <li>Panel editors: <strong>File &rArr; Store ALL table content and panels...</strong> {<em>Old:
        <strong>File &rArr; Store Panels...</strong></em>} or use the PanelPro main menu item
        <strong>File &rArr; Store ALL table content and panels...</strong> {<em>Old: <strong>Panels &rArr;
        Store Panels...</strong></em>}</li>

        <li>Tables (also Fast Clock): <strong>File &rArr; Store &rArr; Store ALL table content and panels...
        </strong> {<em>Old: <strong>Store configuration and panels</strong></em>}</li>

        <li>Roster entry: (a) automatic (b) File &rArr; Save or "Save to Roster" (c) "Write" to
        Decoder</li>

        <li>Images/Icons: "Save Image Index"</li>

        <li>Scripts: "Store..." (on Script Entry window)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>These commands are identified in the tables by these numbers.</p>

      <p><strong>Where Stored:</strong> Data stored on disk by JMRI is separated into a number of
      files and directories. The typical user shouldn't have to deal with these, but for those who
      are interested, see the help page on <a href=
      "../doc/Technical/ProfileFileStructure.shtml">Profile File Structure.</a></p>
      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h2 id="category">JMRI Elements by Category</h2>

      <p>This index cross-references JMRI data by <strong>Category</strong>: Layout Element,
      Operations Element, Roster Element, Preferences, and Other. The column
      <strong>Creates/Saves</strong> uses abbreviations for the situations listed above, e.g.
      "UC/US" means "User Created/ User Stored." The <strong>Store Command</strong> uses the
      numbers above for the different commands.</p>
