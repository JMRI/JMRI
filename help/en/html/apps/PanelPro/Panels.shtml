      <h1>JMRI: Creating Control Panels</h1>The JMRI libraries
      contain a system for creating control panels. It's highly
      customizable, and allows you to control the railroad from the
      panel directly.

      <h2>Contents of a panel</h2><img src=

      <p>Clicking on a turnout symbol flips it from closed to
      thrown and vice-versa. A turnout also has "unknown" and
      "inconsistent" states, represented by an icon with a question
      mark and X respectively. These represent a state where no
      information has been received, and where the information is
      internally inconsistent (e.g. both closed and thrown at the
      same time).</p>

      <p>"Sensors" can be used to represent occupancy indicators or
      other inputs. The default icon is a small circle, with color
      used to represent the state of the sensor. In the example
      above there are seven sensors being driven by occupancy
      indicators. Clicking on a sensor causes the sensor to
      alternate between "active" and "inactive" states. With the
      default icons, active is a green circle and inactive is an
      empty circle. These are meant to represent a lit/dark panel
      indicator. A red circle represents the "unknown" state, used
      when no information has yet been received from the
      layout.</p>

      <h2>Creating a panel</h2>(Nick Kulp presented a nice clinic
      on this topic during March 2004; his slides are <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/community/clinics/NickKulpMarch2004/index.html">
      available on the main JMRI web site</a>. Dick Bronson has
      provided several animated introductions to PanelPro on
      <a href="http://www.rr-cirkits.com/Clinics/Clinics.html">his
      own web pages</a>.

      <p>Panels are made with a "Panel Editor", which allows you to
      place images to represent turnouts, sensors (on some systems)
      and trackwork.</p>

      <p>You start the editor by selecting "New Panel...", then
      "Panel Editor" from the "Panels" menu on the main window.
      You'll get a blank control panel, plus the editor window:
      <a href="../../../images/paneleditor.gif"><img src=
      "../../../images/paneleditor.gif" alt=
      "screen shot of panel editor" align="right" width="208"
      height="364" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a></p>

      <p><a name="editor" id="editor">From the top, this
      contains:</a></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Two text fields specifying where (in pixels) new
        components will be inserted on the panel. You can generally
        ignore these, as once the components has been inserted you
        can drag it around by holding the meta (Apple, command,
        etc) key down.</li>

        <li>A button to pick a background image. The editor's
        drawing capability is rudimentary and likely to stay that
        way for a long time. To create CTC panels, complex track
        diagrams, etc, its easier to draw them in some other
        program and insert them as the background image for a JMRI
        control panel.</li>

        <li>A button to add a text label. Put the desired text in
        the field and click the button. You can slide the label
        around after inserting it, but you currently can't edit the
        text later.</li>

        <li>A button to add an icon as a label. This is a way to
        add track symbols, etc. To see or select the icon, click on
        the "Edit icon..." button.</li>

        <li>Two sections for adding left- and right-bound turnouts.
        These actually work the same way, only with different icons
        to represent the states of the turnouts. Enter the turnout
        number (e.g. 23) and click "Add turnout:". If you'd prefer
        a different graphic for the closed and thrown states, you
        can change their icons with the "Edit icon..." button.</li>

        <li>A section for adding a sensor. Type the sensor number
        (e.g. 74 or LS74) in the field and click "Add
        sensor:".</li>

        <li>A section for adding a signal head. Type the signal
        head number in the field and click "Add sensor:".</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each of these also has a "Edit icons..." button, which
      allows you to select which icons will be shown for the
      turnout, sensor, etc that you are about to add.</p>

      <p>After getting the panel the way you want, you can use the
      "Store panel..." entry in the "Panels" menu to write it to an
      XML file.</p>

      <h3>Icons</h3>The Panel Editor is icon based. The JMRI
      library contains lots of contributed icons for representing
      CTC panels, LEDs, etc. You can browse through them with the
      tree in the bottom of the editor frame. Perhaps the best way
      to see what each looks like is to select it in the tree, then
      click on the icon next to the "Add icon" button. That will
      load it.

      <p>For little bits of track, e.g. to connect turnouts, you
      might want</p>
      <pre>
 resources -&gt; icons -&gt; small schematics -&gt;tracksegments
</pre>then block.gif, etc.

      <p>We do need to do a better job of organizing those...</p>

      <h3>Other types of panels</h3>Because Panel Editor is
      icon-based, you can create panels that look any way you want.
      For example, instead of using track-schematic icons for
      turnouts, you could use small images of the levers and plates
      on CTC machine. This would give you "mechanical" levers you
      can flip back and forth with a click.

      <p>To make this really easy, we need to have a better editor.
      And making a "real" CTC panel will require better signal
      logic to handle the code buttons, etc. If you've got opinions
      on how this should work, please send comments!</p>

      <h2>Using the panel</h2>To command a turnout to change state
      (e.g. closed to thrown), click on it.

      <p>To move it around, you "meta-drag" it. On a Mac, that's
      "hold the cmd key and drag with the cursor"; on windows, it
      might be the Windows or control key. Or it might be a
      right-drag. Sorry, I don't have a Windows machine here to
      figure it out.</p>

      <p>There's also a pop-up menu (ctrl-click on a Mac) that will
      let you rotate the icon so that it points in whatever
      direction you want.</p>
