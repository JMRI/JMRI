<h1>JMRI: PanelPro, An Application For Making Control Panels</h1>

The  JMRI libraries
contain the PanelPro application for creating simple control panels.
This page describes that application, and how to use it.
<p>
PanelPro provides two separate ways to create control panels.
<ul>
<li>The 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelEditor.shtml">Panel Editor</a>
lets you draw a panel exactly the
way you want it, and then animate parts of it to show the status of 
your layout and let you click to control it.
<li>The 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor</a>
provides tools for drawing your layout
while constructing the logic for signals, etc.  It constrains how 
the panel appears a little, but it can save significant time when
first bringing your layout up.
</UL>


<h2>Which to use ?  Layout Editor or Panel Editor ? </h2>

<p> 
The Layout Editor builds a "Layout" which is a <i>logical description</i> of
your entire layout. You only have a single Layout, otherwise it is not 
possible for the software to connect track elements together across the boundaries
between multiple Layouts. 
A Layout, built with the Layout Editor, can be used for directly controlling
elements such as turnouts and signals; indeed many users find it very suitable for 
this task. But, it is primarily designed for automation and
semi-automation within JMRI. For example, you can use the Layout Editor to
construct a description of your track and its blocks and signals.
The software can automatically work out how to set your signals
based on the position of turnouts and whether blocks are occupied,
and the rules appropriate to your railroad (ie. select the signal
rules based on different company practices!, and no need to know how to create
the rules to link your signals to the state of turnouts, blocks and other signals !).  
In addition, the Layout description of your railway can be used by 
scripts such as AutoDispatcher2 to automatically control your trains. There are many
other tools within JMRI which require a description of your railroad and 
the description comes from the Layout built in the Layout Editor. 
The Layout Editor has many rules built into it about how track is connected, the 
naming of blocks, etc..  In order to function, there are
constraints on the appearance of track elements and how they are used.  

<p> 
The Panel Editor builds <i>graphical control</i> Panels.  You can have as
many of Panels as you like, covering as much or as little of
your railway as you like, with overlaps in area or functionality if required.   
Panels might be diagrams showing the state of the track and signals, or 
they might be prototypical signaling and dispatcher panels.  Or anything else
you find useful to control your railroad; you have total flexibility over
their appearance. There are several standard graphics sets distributed with
JMRI, but it is often necessary to make some of the elements in an
external graphics package to be imported as GIF or PNG files. These might be
the Panel Background, or the icons to attach to active elements (switches, 
levers, track state, signals, etc.) which are then placed on the Panel.

</a>
Many people use both, with the Layout Editor creating schematic panels
to handle the actual configuration for signals and Panel Editor providing
exactly the appearance desired. For example, 
Bob Bucklew has prepared a three part 
<a href="http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/JMRI_Panel_Tutorial.html ">tutorial</a>
that describes how Panel Pro and Layout Editor can be used together.


<p>
Please see our
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/community/examples/Gallery.shtml">gallery page</a>
for examples of how model railroaders have used this on their own layouts.
There's also an example of using PanelPro for
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/community/examples/Modules.shtml">modular layouts</a>.

<p>
Rodney Black's <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/">CATS</a>
application is another tool for creating modern-style control panels.


<h2>The Panel Editor</h2>
<a href="../../../images/CornwallPanelLit.gif"><IMG src="../../../images/CornwallPanelLit.gif" ALT="screen shot of Cornwall panel" WIDTH="333" HEIGHT="200" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"></a>

<p>
Using the JMRI Panel Editor, 
you can make a control panel look and operate any way you want.
<P>
A panel is one or more background pictures, on which are drawn
icons to represent Turnouts, Sensors and Signals on the layout.
You can build the background from small icons (as in the image above left), 
or provide a detailed drawing that you created in a drawing
program (image above right).

<p>
You can use these tools to configure quite complicated panels for
large layouts.  The example above is from 
<A href="http://kc.pennsyrr.com/layouts/kulp/index.html">Nick Kulp's Cornwall Railroad</a>.
There's a
<A HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/community/examples/Panels-Cornwall/Cornwall.html">page on the main web site</a>
that describes this in detail.
There's also a
<A HREF="http://ownry.squarespace.com/blog/2011/4/7/ctc-dispatcher-panel-on-the-ownry.html?SSScrollPosition=0">page describing the panel</a> 
for Kent Williams's
<A HREF="http://ownry.squarespace.com/modelrailroad/">Oregon Washington Navigation &amp; Railway<a/>.
Robert Bucklew's Quaker Valley Lines is also building a 
<A HREF="http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/QV_CTCnew.html">CTC panel</a>
using PanelPro.
(This is a second generation panel with some advanced features; there's also
a page describing the 
<A HREF="http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/QV_CTC.html">older, simpler panel</a>)_
<P>
Also, refer to the
<A HREF="../../tools/signaling/index.shtml">signaling page</a>
for information on adding logic to operate the signals on your layout
under the control of your panel.

<h3>Panel operation</h3>
Clicking on a turnout symbol flips it from closed to thrown and vice-versa.
A turnout also has "unknown" and "inconsistent" states, represented by an
icon with a question mark and X respectively. These represent a state where
no information has been received, and where the information is internally inconsistent
(e.g. both closed and thrown at the same time).
<p>
This control can be used in various ways.  For example, you could
have a turnout icon covering a turnout on a schematic diagram.  When you
click on it, the turnout on the layout would be commanded to change, and
the track diagram would show which way a train would be routed.
Or you could use icons that show a lever to the right or left, and create
a panel that looks like a traditional US&amp;S panel.
<p>
"Sensors" can be used to represent occupancy indicators or other inputs.  The default icon
is a small circle, with color used to represent the state of the sensor.  
These respond to changes on the layout automatically.
Clicking on a sensor causes the sensor to alternate between "active" and "inactive"
states. With the default icons, active is a green circle and inactive is an empty circle.
These are meant to represent a lit/dark panel indicator.  A red circle represents the
"unknown" state, used when no information has yet been received from the layout.

<h3>Creating a panel</h3>
These are made with a "Panel Editor", which allows you to place images
to represent turnouts, sensors (on some systems) and trackwork.
<p>
The rest of this page gives you a walk-through of the 
process.  If you'd like to see animated clinics that
show how each of these things are actually done on the computer screen,
please see 
<A HREF="http://www.rr-cirkits.com/Clinics/Clinics.html">Dick Bronson's clinics page</a>.
<p>
You start the editor by selecting "New Panel..." then "Panel Editor" from the "Panels" menu
on the main window.  You'll get a blank control panel, plus the
editor window:<BR>
<A HREF="../../../images/paneleditor.gif">
<IMG SRC="../../../images/paneleditor.gif" ALT="Screen shot of panel editor" 
WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="364" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" align="right"></a>
<P>
From the top, this contains:
<UL>
<LI>Two text fields specifying where (in pixels) new components will be inserted on the panel.
You can generally ignore these, as once the components has been inserted you can drag it around by 
holding the meta (Apple, command, etc) key down.
<LI>A button to pick a background image.  The editor's drawing capability is rudimentary
and likely to stay that way for a long time.  To create CTC panels, complex track diagrams, etc,
its easier to draw them in some other program and insert them as the background image
for a JMRI control panel. 

<LI>A button to add a text label.  Put the desired text in the field and click the button. You can 
slide the label around after inserting it, but you currently can't edit the text later.

<LI>A button to add an icon as a label.  This is a way to add track symbols, etc. To select the
icon, click the "edit icon..." button to pop an
icon editor panel.<BR>
<A HREF="../../../images/iconeditor.gif">
<IMG SRC="../../../images/iconeditor.gif" ALT="Screen shot of icon editor" 
WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="214" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" align="right"></a><br>
The current icon is shown at the top.
To change it, use the tree in the bottom of the window to select a new one, then click on 
the icon at the top of the icon editor panel
to load the selected icon.  This is a general mechanism:  Any icon on an icon editor window
can be replaced by selecting the desired new one and clicking on the icon to be replaced.

<LI>Two sections for adding left- and right-bound turnouts.  These actually work the same
way, only with different icons to represent the states of the turnouts.  Enter the turnout number
(e.g. 23) and click "Add turnout:".  If you'd prefer a different graphic for the closed
and thrown states, you can change their icons as described above.

<LI>A section for adding a sensor.  
Type the sensor number (e.g. 74) in the field and click "Add sensor:".
</UL>

There are also buttons to add more advanced objects, including a clock face,
and checkboxes that control the operation of the panel.  
More information about these is available on the 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelEditor.shtml">Panel Editor help page</a>.

<P>
After getting the panel the way you want, you can use the "Store panel..." 
entry in the "Panels" menu
to write it to an XML file.

<h3>Available Icons</h3>
The JMRI library contains lots of contributed icons
for representing CTC panels, LEDs, etc.  You can browse through them with the tree
in the bottom of the editor frame.  Perhaps the best way to see what each looks like
is to select it in the tree, then click on the icon next to the "Add icon" button.  That
will load it.
<P>
You can also create your own icons and use them by selecting from the "file" section.
<P>
For little bits of track, e.g. to connect turnouts, you might want
<pre>
 resources -> icons -> small schematics ->tracksegments
</PRE>
then block.gif, etc.

<P>
We do need to do a better job of organizing the available icons!

<h3>Manipulating Icons</h3>

To move an icon around on the panel, 
you "meta-drag" it.  On a Mac, that's "hold the cmd key and 
drag with the cursor"; on windows, it might be the Windows  or control key.  
Or it might be a right-drag.  Sorry, I don't have a Windows machine here to 
figure it out.
<P>
There's also a pop-up menu (ctrl-click on a Mac) that will provide
various ways to manipulate the icon. It will let you rotate the 
icon so that it points in whatever direction you want. Text labels
can have their font, size and color changed.  You can also remove
icons from the panel with the popup menu.

<h3>Other types of panels</h3>

Because this is icon-based, you can create panels that look any way you 
want.  For example, instead of using track-schematic icons for turnouts, you
could use small images of the levers and plates on CTC machine.  This would 
give you "mechanical" levers you can flip back and forth with a click.
This can be made absolutely prototypical, or can be simplified for easier
and faster operation, as you prefer.

<P>It's also possible to create a panel where the "track" lines 
change color to indicate whether the track is occupied.  The
procedure for doing that is described on a 
<A HREF="ColorTrack.shtml">separate page</a>.

<h2>Using the Layout Editor</h2>

<A href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/EnhancedPanel.gif">
<IMG src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/EnhancedPanel.gif" ALIGN="right" ALT="screen shot of layout editor panel" WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="86" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"></A>

The 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor</a>
helps you create simple schematic panels, while simultaneously setting up the 
block and signal logic needed to operate the layout.  Its strength is 
its ability to capture how the tracks are connected, where each block is
located and how each signal is related to blocks.  On the other hand, it
provides only limited ability to customize how the panel appears.
<p>

<A href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif">
<IMG src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif" ALIGN="right" ALT="screen shot of layout editor panel" WIDTH="271" HEIGHT="85" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"></A>

You edit via "Edit Mode", which makes the connections between elements and
the layout visible (See figure to the right).  For example, you can click on
the circle in the middle of a track segment and select the associated occupancy detector (Sensor)
on the layout. Once you've done that, the color of the track segment on the screen will change
when the track is occupied.  You can configure the colors used, the width of the track lines, and
other details of the presentation.

<p>
For more information, please see the 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor help page</a>.

<h2>Communicating with Multiple Systems</h2>

PanelPro can communicate with more than one layout control system.  For
example, the Cornwall Railroad mentioned above uses C/MRI hardware for sensing the status
of blocks and turnouts on the layout, but drives turnout positions through
a Digitrax DCC system.
<P>
To configure the program to talk to multiple systems, just select the first one in 
standard part of the the
preferences panel, and the select the second in the "<a href="../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#advanced">Advanced Preferences</a>".
For more information, see the preferences panel
<a href="../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">help page</a>.
<P>
If you add a turnout, sensor or signal to a panel using just a number, e.g. "23",
it will be assigned to the first system on the preference panel.  To
access the 2nd system, you have to use JMRI 
<A HREF="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">system names</a>.  For example, if the second attachment is
to a LocoNet system, you'd refer to a LocoNet Turnout as LT13; a LocoNet sensor
as LS21, etc.  See the page on 
<A href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">names</a>
for more information.
