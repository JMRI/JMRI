      <h1>JMRI: PanelPro</h1>
            <p>The JMRI libraries contain the PanelPro
            application for creating panels to control or follow your
            (virtual) model railroad. This page introduces the
            application, and how to use it.</p>

            <p>PanelPro provides four separate ways to create Panels:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="#pe">Panel Editor</a> lets you graphically
                draw a Panel exactly the way you want it, and then animate
                parts of it to show the status of your layout and let you
                click to control it.</li>

                <li>The <a href="#cpe">Control Panel Editor</a> works like
                Panel Editor but provides an alternative interface.</li>

                <li>The <a href="#le">Layout Editor</a> provides tools to
                make a smart schematic of your layout while constructing
                the logic for signals, etc. This constrains how the panel
                appears a little, but it can save significant time when
                first bringing your layout up.</li>

                <li>The <a href="#swb">Switchboard Editor</a> is a graphic,
                straightforward control interface, showing a range of switch
                keys to watch and control items.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Which Editor to use?</h2>

            <p>All Panel Editors use the same information about your layout
            stored in JMRI but each serves a different goal and approach.

            <p>The <strong><a href="#pe">Panel Editor</a></strong> and the
            <strong><a href="#cpe">Control Panel Editor</a></strong> let
            you build purely <i>graphical</i> (image based) Panels.<br>
            You can have as many Panels as you like, covering as
            much or as little of your railway as you like, with overlaps
            in area or functionality if required. Panels might be
            diagrams showing the state of the track and signals, or they
            might be prototypical signaling and dispatcher panels. Or
            anything else you find useful to control your railroad; you
            have total flexibility over their appearance. There are
            several standard graphics sets distributed with JMRI, but it
            is often necessary to make some of the elements in an
            external graphics package to be imported as PNG files.
            These might include the Panel Background, or the icons to attach
            to active elements (switches, levers, track state, signals,
            etc.) which are then placed on the Panel.</p>

            <p>The <strong><a href="#le">Layout Editor</a></strong> builds
            a "Layout" which is a <i>logical description</i> of your
            entire layout. A Layout, built with the Layout Editor, can
            be used for directly controlling elements such as Turnouts
            and Signals; indeed many users find it very suitable for this
            task. But, it is primarily designed for automation and
            semi-automation within JMRI. For example, you can use the
            Layout Editor to construct a description of your track and
            its blocks and signals. The software can automatically work
            out how to set your signals based on the position of turnouts
            and whether blocks are occupied, and the rules appropriate to
            your railroad (ie. select the signal rules based on different
            company practices!, and no need to know how to create the
            rules to link your signals to the state of turnouts, blocks
            and other signals !). Layout Editor Panels may also be used to
            set up automatic running of trains on your layout using <a href=
            "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a>.
            In addition, the Layout description of your railway can be
            used by scripts such as the included
            <a href="../../tools/scripting/Examples.shtml">AutoDispatcher2</a>
            to automatically control your trains. There are many other
            tools within JMRI which require a description of your
            railroad and the description comes from the Layout built in
            the Layout Editor. The Layout Editor has many rules built
            into it about how track is connected, the naming of blocks,
            etc. In order to function, there are constraints on the
            appearance of track elements and how they are used.<br>
            You can have multiple Layout panels, but you have to tell
            the software how to connect track elements across the
            boundaries between multiple Layouts.</p>

            <p>The <strong><a href="#swb">Switchboard Editor</a></strong>
            is easier to set up, using a simple grid of pre-defined buttons
            or indicators. It is limited to the basic inputs (Sensors) and
            Outputs (Turnouts and Lights) and has a couple of ready-made
            graphic display styles.</p>

            <h3>Panel Examples</h3>
            <p><a href=
            "http://quaker-valley.com/CTC/JMRI%20Panel%20Tutorial.gif">
            <img src="http://quaker-valley.com/CTC/JMRI%20Panel%20Tutorial.gif"
            align="right" height="216" width="313"></a> Many people use
            a combination of panel types, with the Layout Editor creating
            schematic panels to handle the actual configuration for
            signals and Panel Editor providing exactly the appearance
            desired.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bob Bucklew has prepared a three part <a href=
            "http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/JMRI_Panel_Tutorial.html">tutorial</a>
            that describes how he used Panel Editor and Layout Editor
            together.</li>
            <li>Our <a href=
            "http://jmri.org/community/examples/Gallery.shtml">Gallery
            page</a> shows examples of how model railroaders have used
            panels on their own layouts, including using PanelPro for <a href=
            "http://jmri.org/community/examples/Modules.shtml">Modular
            layouts</a>.</li>
            <li>Rodney Black's <a href="http://cats4ctc.org/">CATS</a>
            (Computer Automated Traffic System) application is another
            tool for creating modern-style Control Panels.</li>
            <li>Our <a href=
            "../../tools/signaling/index.shtml">Signaling help page</a>
            explains how to add logic to operate the signals on your
            layout under the control of or shown on your panel.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Panel operation basics</h3>
            <p>Clicking on a Turnout symbol on any of the Panels flips it
            from Closed to Thrown and vice-versa (unless operation is
            disabled in the Configuration). A Turnout also has
            "Unknown" and "Inconsistent" states, represented by an icon
            with a "?" and "X" respectively. These represent a
            state where no information has been received, and where the
            information is internally inconsistent (e.g. both Closed and
            Thrown at the same time).<br>
            Control of items like Turnouts from a Panel can be done
            in various ways. For example in Panel Editor, you
            could have a turnout icon covering a turnout on a schematic
            diagram. When you click on it, the turnout on the layout
            would be commanded to change, and the track diagram would
            show which way a train would be routed. Or you could use
            icons that show a lever to the right or left, and create a
            panel that looks like a traditional US&amp;S panel.</p>

            <p>"Sensors" can be used to represent occupancy indicators or
            other inputs. The default icon is a small circle, with color
            used to represent the state of the sensor. These respond to
            changes on the layout automatically. Clicking on a sensor
            causes the sensor to alternate between "Active" and
            "Inactive" states. With the default icons, Active is a green
            circle and Inactive is an empty circle. These are meant to
            represent a lit/dark panel indicator. A red circle represents
            the "unknown" state, used when no information has yet been
            received from the layout.</p>

            <h3>Creating a panel</h3>
            <p>JMRI Panels are made using one of the Editors.
            Start the Editor by selecting "New Panel..." then "Xxx
            Editor" from the "Panels" menu on the main window.</p>

            <p>After getting the Panel the way you want, you use the
            "Store Panels..." entry in the "Panels" menu to write it to an
            .xml file on disk, allowing to reload it the next time you run JMRI
            and see all your turnouts, sensors etc as you configured them.<br>
            A Panel xml file contains ALL of the tables and panels.
            It is recommended to start with just one panel/configuration file
            for your layout. Except for some specific use cases, multiple xml
            files create confusion and errors.<br>
            Think of the xml file as a book. There are chapters for turnouts,
            sensors, signals, blocks, Logix, etc. Each panel is also a chapter.
            As the layout design is progressing, various chapters are created
            and modified. It is a good idea to periodically save the changes.
            Some people use an incrementing file naming approach. Others rely
            on the <i>backupPanels</i> directory where you can find older
            versions of the configuration file (see the <a href=
            "../../setup/Files.shtml">JMRI Configuration Files</a>)</p>

            <h3>(Re)opening a panel file</h3>
            <p>When starting your next PanelPro session, either load the latest
            xml file via the Panels &gt; Open Panel... menu item or add an
            "Open file..." entry to <a
            href="../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Startup">"Preferences
            &gt; Start Up"</a> to do it for you.</p>

            <a name="pe" id="pe"></a>
            <h2>The Panel Editor</h2>
            <a href="../../../images/CornwallPanelLit.gif"><img src=
            "../../../images/CornwallPanelLit.gif" align="right" alt=
            "screen shot of Cornwall panel" width="333" height="200"></a>

            <p>With the Panel Editor, you can make a control panel
            look and operate any way you want because they are icon-based.
            For example, instead of using track-schematic icons for
            turnouts, you could use small images of the levers and plates
            on CTC machine. This would give you "mechanical" levers you
            can flip back and forth with a click. This can be made
            absolutely prototypical, or can be simplified for easier and
            faster operation, as you prefer.</p>

            <p>A panel is one or more background pictures, on which are
            drawn icons to represent Turnouts, Sensors and Signals on the
            layout. You can build the background from small icons (as in
            the image above left), or provide a detailed drawing that you
            created in a drawing program (image above right).</p>

            <p>You can use these tools to configure quite complicated
            panels for even large layouts. The example above is from <a href=
            "http://kc.pennsyrr.com/layouts/kulp/index.html">Nick Kulp's
            Cornwall Railroad</a>. There's a <a href=
            "http://jmri.org/community/examples/Panels-Cornwall/Cornwall.html">
            page on the main web site</a> that describes this in detail.
            There's also a <a href=
            "http://ownry.squarespace.com/blog/2011/4/7/ctc-dispatcher-panel-on-the-ownry.html?SSScrollPosition=0">
            page describing the panel</a> for Kent Williams's <a href=
            "http://ownry.squarespace.com/modelrailroad/">Oregon
            Washington Navigation &amp; Railway</a>. Robert Bucklew's
            Quaker Valley Lines is also building a <a href=
            "http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/QV_CTCnew.html">CTC
            panel</a> using PanelPro.</p>

            <h2>The Control Panel Editor</h2>

            <p><b>Control Panel Editor</b> is simply an alternative view
            and controller with the same content data as <b>Panel
            Editor</b>. Control Panel Editor allows you to edit a Panel
            using menus instead of a separate editing window.</p>
            <p>It's also possible to create a Control Panel where the "track"
            lines change color to indicate whether the block is occupied.
            Control Panel Editor supports using
            <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/logix/Warrant.shtml">
            Warrants</a> and automatic running of trains.</p>

            <p>For more information, see the <a href=
            "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/ControlPanelEditor.shtml">
            Control Panel Editor help page</a>.</p>

            <a name="le" id="le"></a>
            <h2>The Layout Editor</h2>
            <p><a href=
            "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/EnhancedPanel.gif"><img
            src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/EnhancedPanel.gif"
            align="right" alt="screen shot of layout editor panel" width=
            "296" height="86" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a> The <a href=
            "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout
            Editor</a> helps you create simple schematic panels, while
            simultaneously setting up the block and signal logic needed
            to operate the layout. Its strength is its ability to capture
            how the tracks are connected, where each block is located and
            how each signal is related to blocks. On the other hand, it
            limits by design the ability to customize how the panel
            appears. For example, you can only place one Turnout symbol
            with the same User Name.</p>

            <p><a href=
            "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif">
            <img src=
            "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif"
            align="right" alt="screen shot of layout editor panel" width=
            "271" height="85" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>In Layout Editor
            you edit your Panel by activating the "Edit Mode", which makes
            the connections between elements and the layout visible (See
            figure to the right, notice the small circles). For example,
            you can click on the circle in the middle of a track segment
            and select the associated occupancy detector (Sensor) on the
            layout. Once you've done that, the color of the track segment
            on the screen will change when the track is occupied. You can
            configure the colors used, the width of the track lines, and
            other details of the presentation.</p>

            <h2><a name="swb" id="swb">The Switchboard Editor</a></h2>
            <p>Switchboards provide a visual control grid for your JMRI layout "out of the box".<br>
            To create a new Switchboard, from the Panels menu, choose New Panel &gt;
            Switchboard Editor.</p>
            <p>For more information, please see the
            <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/SwitchboardEditor.shtml">
            Switchboard Editor help page</a>.</p>

            <h2>Communicating with Multiple Systems</h2>

            <p>PanelPro can communicate with more than one layout control
            system. For example, the Cornwall Railroad mentioned above
            uses C/MRI hardware for sensing the status of blocks and
            turnouts on the layout, but drives turnout positions through
            a Digitrax DCC system.</p>

            <p>To configure the program to talk to multiple systems, add
            both in JMRI Preferences using the + tab on the Connections
            pane. For more information, see the <a href=
            "../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Preferences
            panel Help page</a>.</p>

            <p>If you add a Turnout, Sensor or Signal Mast to a Panel
            using just a number, e.g. "23" in the Add... pane of a table,
            its System Name will be created using the System Connection
            Prefix as set in the Preferences panel -&gt; Connections tab
            (e.g. LT1 for a turnout on the L LocoNet connection).
            As a second system connection is required to use a different
            prefix, it is simple to use more than one hardware
            system at the same time. See the page on <a href=
            "../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Names &amp; Naming</a> for
            more information.</p>
