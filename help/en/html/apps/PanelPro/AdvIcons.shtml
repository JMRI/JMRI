      <h1>JMRI: Icons in (Control) Panel Editor</h1>

        <h3>Select an Icon to use</h3>
        <p>To select the icon, click the "Change
        Icon..." button to pop an icon editor panel.<br>
        <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/PanelEditor.png"><img src=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/images/PanelEditor.png" alt=
        "Screen shot of panel editor" width="299" height="392"
        hspace="0" vspace="0" align="right"></a>
        <br>
        The current icon is shown at the top. To change it, use the
        tree in the bottom of the window to select a new one, then
        click on the icon at the top of the icon editor panel to
        load the selected icon. This is a general mechanism: Any
        icon on an icon editor window can be replaced by selecting
        the desired new one and clicking on the icon to be
        replaced.</p>

        <h3>Available Icons</h3>
        <p>The JMRI library contains lots of user
        contributed icons for representing CTC panels, LEDs, etc. You
        can browse through them with the tree in the bottom of the
        editor frame. Perhaps the best way to see what each looks
        like is to select it in the tree, then click on the icon next
        to the "Add icon" button. That will load it.</p>

        <p>You can also create your own icons and use them by
        selecting from the "file" section.</p>

        <p>For little bits of track, e.g. to connect turnouts, you
        might want</p>
        <pre>
 resources -&gt; icons -&gt; small schematics -&gt;tracksegments
</pre>then block.gif, etc.

        <p>We do need to do a better job of organizing the available
        icons!</p>

        <h3>Manipulating Icons</h3>To move an icon around on the
        panel, you "meta-drag" it. On a Mac, that's "hold the cmd key
        and drag with the cursor"; on windows, it might be the
        Windows or control key. Or it might be a right-drag. Sorry, I
        don't have a Windows machine here to figure it out.

        <p>There's also a pop-up menu (ctrl-click on a Mac) that will
        provide various ways to manipulate the icon. It will let you
        rotate the icon so that it points in whatever direction you
        want. Text labels can have their font, size and color
        changed. You can also remove icons from the panel with the
        popup menu.</p>

      <a name="memoryicon" id="memoryicon"></a>
      <h3>Memory Icons</h3>Memory objects are meant for scripting
      control; the first implementation is a MemoryIcon that lets
      you put a multi-state icon on the screen.

      <p>MemoryIcon objects work two ways: If a series of icons is
      defined in the file, the memory contents will be translated
      via this table (this was the original behavior). If there
      aren't any icons defined, the memory contents is displayed
      directly, as a string if it's a String and as a NamedIcon if
      it's a NamedIcon.</p>

      <p>See xml/samples/MemoryIconExample.xml for info on how to
      set this up. <a name="reportericon" id=
      "reportericon"></a></p>

      <h3>Reporter Icons</h3><a href=
      "../../tools/images/AddReportertoPanel.png"><img src=
      "../../tools/images/AddReportertoPanel.png" height="146"
      width="166" align="right"></a> The first implementation of
      Reporter is Digitrax transponding. By adding the appropriate
      elements to your Panel files, you can show decoder ID
      information on your Panels. 
      <!-- information below was copied from tools/Reporters.shtml 01/2016 -->

      <p>A Reporter's value can be displayed on a Panel via an
      icon. To do this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>On the Panel Editor window for your Panel, find the
        "Add Reporter" button.</li>

        <li>In the text box next to that button, type the user name
        or System Name of the desired Reporter.</li>

        <li>Click the "Add to Panel" button. The Reporter icon will
        be placed on your Panel. If it's not visible, that might be
        because the value is currently blank; use the Reporter
        Table to change the value to something that will be
        visible.</li>

        <li>You can drag the icon to where you want it in the usual
        way.</li>

        <li>The pop-up menu on the icon will let you change the
        formatting.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>See xml/samples/ReporterIconExample.xml for info on how to
      set this code up by hand.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First check that JMRI is seeing the LocoNet messages
        OK. From the tools menu, open the "Reporter Table". Run a
        locomotive across your transponding sections, and you
        should see the arrival and departure status show up on one
        of the lines in the table.</li>

        <li>Next, you need to add the "ReporterIcon" that displays
        this directly to the panel file.

          <p>Look in the "xml/samples" directory within JMRI for a
          file called "ReporterIconExample.xml".</p>

          <p>(It's also available <a href=
          "http://jmri.org/xml/samples/ReporterIconExample.xml">on
          the web</a> but many browsers will try to interpret it
          instead of showing you the text; your browser's "View
          Source" option might help with that)</p>

          <p>You'll see this line:</p>

          <p>&lt;reportericon reporter="LR12" x="10" y="10"
          class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.ReporterIconXml"/&gt;</p>

          <p>The "x" and "y" define where you want it on your
          panel. The "LR12" is the name of the reporter object,
          e.g. the name of the one you saw changing when you were
          looking at the table.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Open your panel file with your favorite editor (WordPad
        if you've got nothing you like better), and insert a line
        like that above right _after_ the line that starts with

          <p>&lt;paneleditor
          class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.PanelEditorXml"</p>

          <p>(The "paneleditor" line starts a new panel. If you
          have more than one panel in the file, you'll have to look
          for the panel title to see where to insert the new
          line)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>It's actually not as hard as it sounds.
