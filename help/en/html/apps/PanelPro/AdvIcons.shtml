      <h3>Memory Icons</h3>Memory objects are meant for scripting
      control; the first implementation is a MemoryIcon that lets
      you put a multi-state icon on the screen.

      <p>MemoryIcon objects work two ways: If a series of icons is
      defined in the file, the memory contents will be translated
      via this table (this was the original behavior). If there
      aren't any icons defined, the memory contents is displayed
      directly, as a string if it's a String and as a NamedIcon if
      it's a NamedIcon.</p>

      <p>See xml/samples/MemoryIconExample.xml for info on how to
      set this up. <a name="reportericon" id=
      "reportericon"></a></p>

      <h3>Reporter Icons</h3><a href=
      "../../tools/images/AddReportertoPanel.png"><img src=
      "../../tools/images/AddReportertoPanel.png" height="146"
      width="166" align="right"></a> The first implementation of
      Reporter is Digitrax transponding. By adding the appropriate
      elements to your Panel files, you can show decoder ID
      information on your Panels. 
      <!-- information below was copied from tools/Reporters.shtml 01/2016 -->

      <p>A Reporter's value can be displayed on a Panel via an
      icon. To do this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>On the Panel Editor window for your Panel, find the
        "Add Reporter" button.</li>

        <li>In the text box next to that button, type the user name
        or System Name of the desired Reporter.</li>

        <li>Click the "Add to Panel" button. The Reporter icon will
        be placed on your Panel. If it's not visible, that might be
        because the value is currently blank; use the Reporter
        Table to change the value to something that will be
        visible.</li>

        <li>You can drag the icon to where you want it in the usual
        way.</li>

        <li>The pop-up menu on the icon will let you change the
        formatting.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>See xml/samples/ReporterIconExample.xml for info on how to
      set this code up by hand.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First check that JMRI is seeing the LocoNet messages
        OK. From the tools menu, open the "Reporter Table". Run a
        locomotive across your transponding sections, and you
        should see the arrival and departure status show up on one
        of the lines in the table.</li>

        <li>Next, you need to add the "ReporterIcon" that displays
        this directly to the panel file.

          <p>Look in the "xml/samples" directory within JMRI for a
          file called "ReporterIconExample.xml".</p>

          <p>(It's also available <a href=
          "http://jmri.org/xml/samples/ReporterIconExample.xml">on
          the web</a> but many browsers will try to interpret it
          instead of showing you the text; your browser's "View
          Source" option might help with that)</p>

          <p>You'll see this line:</p>

          <p>&lt;reportericon reporter="LR12" x="10" y="10"
          class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.ReporterIconXml"/&gt;</p>

          <p>The "x" and "y" define where you want it on your
          panel. The "LR12" is the name of the reporter object,
          e.g. the name of the one you saw changing when you were
          looking at the table.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Open your panel file with your favorite editor (WordPad
        if you've got nothing you like better), and insert a line
        like that above right _after_ the line that starts with

          <p>&lt;paneleditor
          class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.PanelEditorXml"</p>

          <p>(The "paneleditor" line starts a new panel. If you
          have more than one panel in the file, you'll have to look
          for the panel title to see where to insert the new
          line)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>It's actually not as hard as it sounds.
