<h1>JMRI: Advanced Icons in PanelPro</h1>

<a name="memoryicon"><h3>Memory Icons</h3></a>

Memory objects are meant for scripting 
control; the first implementation is a MemoryIcon that lets you put a multi-state icon 
on the screen. 
<p>
MemoryIcon objects work two ways:  If a series of icons is
defined in the file, the memory contents will be translated
via this table (this was the original behavior).  
If there aren't any icons defined, the memory contents is displayed 
directly, as a string if it's a String and as a NamedIcon 
if it's a NamedIcon.
<p>
See xml/samples/MemoryIconExample.xml for info 
on how to set this up.

<a href="../../tools/images/AddReportertoPanel.png">

The first implementation of Reporter is Digitrax transponding.  
By adding the appropriate elements to your Panel files, you can show 
decoder ID information on your Panels.
<!-- information below was copied from tools/Reporters.shtml 01/2016 -->
<p>A Reporter's value can be displayed on a Panel via an icon.
To do this:
	<ul>
	<li>On the Panel Editor window for your Panel, find the "Add Reporter" 
	button.
	<li>In the text box next to that button, type the user name or System Name of the
	desired Reporter.
	<li>Click the "Add to Panel" button. The Reporter icon will be placed on your Panel.
	If it's not visible, that might be because the value is currently blank;
	use the Reporter Table to change the value to something that will be visible.
	<li>You can drag the icon to where you want it in the usual way.
	<li>The pop-up menu on the icon will let you change the formatting.
	</ul>
<p>
See xml/samples/ReporterIconExample.xml for info 
on how to set this code up by hand.

	<ul>
	<li>First check that JMRI is seeing the LocoNet messages OK.  From the tools 
	menu, open the "Reporter Table". Run a locomotive across your 
	transponding sections, and you should see the arrival and departure 
	status show up on one of the lines in the table.
	
	<li>
	Next, you need to add the "ReporterIcon" that displays this directly 
	to the panel file.
	<p>
	Look in the "xml/samples" directory within JMRI for a file called 
	"ReporterIconExample.xml".
	<p>
	(It's also available 
	<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/xml/samples/ReporterIconExample.xml">on the web</a>
	but many browsers will try to interpret it instead of showing you the 
	text; your browser's "View Source" option might help with that)
	<p>
	You'll see this line:
	<p>
	&lt;reportericon reporter="LR12" x="10" y="10" 
	class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.ReporterIconXml"/&gt;
	<p>
	The "x" and "y" define where you want it on your panel.  The "LR12" 
	is the name of the reporter object, e.g. the name of the one you saw 
	changing when you were looking at the table.
	<li>
	Open your panel file with your favorite editor (WordPad if you've got 
	nothing you like better), and insert a line like that above  right 
	_after_ the line that starts with
	<p>
	  &lt;paneleditor class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.PanelEditorXml"
	<p>
	(The "paneleditor" line starts a new panel.  If you have more than 
	one panel in the file, you'll have to look for the panel title to see 
	where to insert the new line)
	</ul>
It's actually not as hard as it sounds.
