      <h1>JMRI: Displaying JMRI Panel Files</h1>

      <p>JMRI panel and configuration information is stored in XML
      files. These are text files that people can directly read,
      but the format and structure information take a lot of
      space.</p>

      <p>JMRI provides a tool, called an "XSLT transform", to
      convert the JMRI panel file into a more readable web page.
      You open your panel file with a web browser, and can then
      read it, print it, copy and paste into a file of another
      form, etc.</p>

           alt="screen shot of xml preview" align="right" width="462"
           height="164" hspace="0" vspace="0">

      <p>A large example of this is available as a <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/community/examples/SPShastaConfigFile.pdf">PDF
      file</a>. This is the configuration information, including
      routes, Logix, etc, for the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/community/examples/SPShasta.shtml">SP Shasta
      Route</a> layout.</p>

      <p>To view your own panel file, just open it with a web
      browser. With some computers and browsers, you drag the
      file's icon onto the browser's icon. Others, you use entries
      in the browser's "File" menu to find and open your file.</p>

      <p>For this to work, your browser needs to be able to find
      the "stylesheet" that does the formatting. If opening the
      panel file doesn't work, particularly if it just opens a
      blank window, or shows error messages about not being able to
      load something, you may have to change the location listed
      for the stylesheet. This location is in the 2nd line of your
      panel file. Unfortunately, we can't give precise rules, as
      different web browsers have different requirements. But there
      are two things you can try:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tell the browser to pick it up from a JMRI web server.

          <p>To do this, change the second line of the file to:</p>
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &lt;?xml-stylesheet href="http://jmri.org/xml/XSLT/panelfile.xsl" type="text/xsl"?&gt;
        
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Put the stylesheet file in the same place as your panel
        file, and tell the browser to use it.

          <p>To do this, first find the "xml/XSLT/panelfile.xsl"
          file in your JMRI distribution directory, or get the most
          recent version from JMRI by downloading <a href=
          "http://jmri.org/xml/XSLT/panelfile.xsl">this link</a>.
          Put a copy of that file in the same directory as the
          panel file you want to display. Then change the second
          line of your panel file to:</p>
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &lt;?xml-stylesheet href="panelfile.xsl" type="text/xsl"?&gt;
        
</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Don't change the first line!</p>
