      <h1>JMRI: Displaying Panel File Contents</h1>

      <p>To load a Panel previously saved to disk in JMRI
      and have the program display it, see <a href="../LoadStoreWork.shtml">
      Loading and Storing Your Work.</a><br>
      In contrast, this page describes how to show the contents
      of the file itself, meaning the data used to draw
      the Panel, either on screen or on paper.</p>

      <p>JMRI panel and configuration information is stored in XML
      files. These are text files that people can directly read,
      but the format and structure information take a lot of
      space.</p>

      <p>JMRI provides a tool, called an "XSLT transform", to
      convert the JMRI panel file into a more readable web page.
      You open your panel file with a web browser, and can then
      read it, print it, copy and paste into a file of another
      form, etc.</p>

      <p>A large example of this is available as a <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/community/examples/SPShastaConfigFile.pdf">PDF
      file</a>. This is the configuration information, including
      routes, Logix, etc, for the <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/community/examples/SPShasta.shtml">SP Shasta
      Route</a> layout.</p>

      <p>To view your own panel file, the easiest approach is to
      view it via JMRI's web server which knows how to find all
      the needed formating files automatically.  The steps are: </p>
      <ol>
      <li>Start the JMRI web server from the Debug menu
      <li>In your favorite browser, go to
        <a href="http://localhost:12080">http://localhost:12080</a>
        (the 12080 is the default setting; if you've changed
        that value in the JMRI preferences, use the correct one here)
      <li>Finally, navigate to your panel file.  If it's in the
        user files part of the preferences (which is strongly
        recommended) start here:
        <a href="http://localhost:12080/prefs">http://localhost:12080/prefs</a>
        then either click on your file, or navigate into the proper directory
        to find it.
        <p>
        If you have put your file in the program directory (not recommended),
        start here:
        <a href="http://localhost:12080/dist">http://localhost:12080/dist</a>
        instead.
    </ol>
