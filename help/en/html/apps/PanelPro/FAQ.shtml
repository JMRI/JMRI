<h1>JMRI: PanelPro Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<a name="context"></a><h3>How does JMRI tie into the rest of my layout?</h3>
<p>Jim Betz responded with this on the JMRI User's alias when asked for an overview:</p>

	<ol>
		<li> JMRI works like a throttle - it sends and listens to the
	messages on the "command bus". Nothing more, nothing less.
	And that is actually - A LOT - and is the true beauty of
	JMRI.
	In the case of DecoderPro the commands that are being used
	and monitored are those related to programming a loco. In
	the case of PanelPro the messages/commands that are being
	used are those pertinent to block occupancy, turnouts, etc.
	
	    <li> Each system has its own "command bus" or "computer
		interface" - i.e. its own
	set of commands (think 'command format') that it uses. This
	is why you can't use a Digitrax throttle on an NCE system.
	Many people refer to the command bus as a "throttle net" - to
	distinguish it from the track bus. And it is important to
	note that the messages on the two are not identical in all
	cases.
	Some systems are similar enough to each other in order to
	make it possible to use a throttle from one on another ...
	but this is relatively rare (very few layouts actually make
	use of it).
	Another solution is CMRI - which has its own command set.
	JMRI also is smart enough to "speak CMRI" (as well as the
	ability to "speak" Digitrax and NCE and Lenz ... etc.) The
	difference being is that CMRI is a command set and hardware
	that is focused only on the RR support systems (signals,
	turnouts, etc.) and does not have the ability to control
	or program trains. And, in point of fact, does not "know"
	whether the layout is DC or DCC. Most of the layouts that
	have implemented CMRI recently have used the CMRI hardware
	and JMRI (PanelPro) for the human interface.
	
	    <li> On DCC layouts the command station is the interface
	between the track and the throttle/command bus. You use
	the throttle bus to acquire a loco ... and to send control
	messages to the command station - which 'forwards' your
	throttle changes to the locos ... and to the stationary
	decoders ... via either the track -or- command bus (or
	both).
	
	    <li> It is possible - some will even say desirable - to separate
	your train support (track bus) from your layout control support.
	Although it may not be intuitive - you don't have to use the
	same system that you use to control trains to control the
	turnouts and signals - simply because messages don't need to
	cross that boundary. This is why some have recommended you
	consider an environment such as NCE for the trains and CMRI
	or Digitrax for the layout support (PanelPro).
	
	    <li> Because Digitrax and CMRI have published their interfaces
	there are more products available for layout control for
	those two systems than for NCE. Both RR-CirKits and
	Team Digital have excellent products out that work for
	Digitrax (for instance). As far as I know there are no
	such products for NCE. I do not know what is/isn't
	available for Lenz.
	
	    <li> PanelPro is still developing at a rapid rate. Many layouts
	are already up and running using PanelPro - but the most
	recent developments that have just recently been made
	available in PanelPro make using it a -lot- easier than it
	used to be. Actually, if you are talking just turnouts and
	block occupancy then PanelPro has been usable for some time.
	Signaling is getting better all the time.
	
	    <li> When you start doing signaling then "everything changes".
	Because signaling requires that the block occupancy and
	turnout status be used in the decision process of "what
	aspect should be displayed on which signals at this point
	in time". This requires layout specific code/logic.
	I'm assuming that you want a computer to make these
	decisions. It is possible to implement a system where a
	human being, usually the dispatcher, does all of the
	decisions ... the more complex the layout/signaling system
	the more errors the dispatcher will make. And there is
	also the "workload" issue(s)... but a computer running
	PanelPro is usually loafing and has more than enough
	power to keep ahead of the needs of the layout.
	<p>
	Implementing layout control (turnouts, block occupancy, signals,
	etc.) is not an "easy deal". And, in my opinion, it is not
	something you should attempt to teach yourself - or to do it alone
	with just the help/guidance of online lists such as this one. I
	am not saying "don't use online" ... I'm saying that if you want to
	do this as easily as possible then you should seek out those who
	have gone before and enlist their face-to-face support/guidance.
	Yes, you can do it your self - no, that's not the best way to do
	this and you will find you make -many- mistakes that will cause
	considerable delays and rework. Many layout automation projects
	have gotten stalled for just this very reason.
	<p>
	And just so this gets mentioned ... adding capabilities such as
	block occupancy detection, computer controlled turnouts, and signals
	is not inexpensive and needs to be budgeted/spec'd out. And you
	may find that you will need to re-wire some or even major portions
	of your layout in order to support them correctly/at all.
	</ol>

<a name="store"></a><h3>How do I save my work?</h3>

There are several ways to save your panel.  This is because the program
has to store both configuration (turnouts, sensors, etc) and layout (the
details of your specific panel) information.
<p>
Usually, the easiest way is to use just one file to contain everything. 
For example, you can store your panel(s) in a file called 
"MainPanel.xml" (or something like that), and set the preferences to 
load that file.  Then, all you have to do is save that file again whenever 
you change something.  One caution: Make sure that you still have the 
panel open when you save the file!  If you close it, then save the file, 
it will of course write a version of the file that doesn't show the panel.  
And save this file from the "Panels" menu, using the "Store Panels..." item.
<p>
This works because panels are stored with all the configuration information at 
that same time (which guarantees they'll work when reloaded)

<a name="multifile"></a><h3>Can I store just the configuration information?</h3>

You can store just the "configuration" information in a file, which
you can save without worrying about whether your panel(s) are open, etc.
If you do this, you can also save your panels to their own, separate files.

<p>
To do this:

	<ul>
	<li>Go to one of the table tools (e.g. Route Table) and 
	pick "Store configuration..." from the "File" menu. 
	<li>This will let you 
	select a file name; make sure it is _NOT_ the same as the panel file 
	name. (e.g. use "MyConfig.xml" instead of "MyPanel.xml") 
	<li>Remember that name and location, then store.  
	</ul>
This puts config info, but not panels, in the file.

<p>
Now, to ensure this configuration information automatically loads when the program starts:  
	<ul>
	<li>Open the preferences panel, 
	<li>check the box for "show advanced preferences", and wait a second for 
	them to appear.  
	<li>Scroll down to "Load panel file at startup", click "Add", 
	<li>and select 
	the file in which you have stored the configuration.  
	<li>Click "Save" on the 
	preferences pane to make sure this is stored.
	<li>Quit the program and restart it to test.
	</ul>

<a name="location">
</a><h3>Where should I put my custom icons and other files?</h3>

The best place to put your own files is in the JMRI
Preferences directory (all JMRI apps use
<a href="../../setup/Files.shtml#location">the same directory<a/>).
You should put any locally-modified
versions of files here so they don't get overwritten by a new version
of the program. Any files that the program writes to contain local
information, e.g. roster entries, are also written here.
<p>The location of this varies by computer type.
<ul>
<li>On a Linux machine, look for a .jmri directory in your home
directory.

<li>On a Macintosh, look in the Preferences folder of the
current System Folder if running MacOS 8 or 9, or the
Library/Preferences folder in your user directory on Mac OS X.

<li>On Windows, this can be in a number of places depending on
which Windows version you're running and whether you have
multiple users configured; Search for a "JMRI" directory to
find it.
</ul>
Make sure you find the preferences, and <em>not</em> the original
application package. They are kept separate to simplify updating the
program version.

You'll know you've found the right place if you see the
preferences files that store your applications settings:
<tt>PanelProConfig2.xml</tt>.  You can also search for this
file to find this directory

<p>
<img src="../../../images/IconFileTree.gif" ALT="Screen shot of file tree" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="327" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="0"/>

If you have created icons that you want to be able from the panel editor,
put them in a directory called "resources" in the Preferences directory.
They'll then show up in the "files" part of the selection box when you press
a "Change icon..." button on the panel editor.

<p>For example, if the Preferences directory contains the files shown below,
you'll get the file display shown at the right.</p>
<code>
> ls resources/
decoderpro.gif  green.gif  icons  red.gif  tester.gif
> ls resources/icons/
something  tester.gif
> ls resources/icons/something/
tester.gif
</code>

<p>
It's also possible to put your files in the <code>resources</code> directory
within the JMRI distribution directory that you get when you install the program.
This is <em>not</em> recommended, because files there will likely be overwritten 
when you install a future version (a newer version of a file, perhaps to fix a problem, 
will overwrite your copy; the replacement is based on the file's date).
