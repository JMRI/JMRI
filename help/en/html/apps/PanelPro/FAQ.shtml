      <h1>JMRI: PanelPro Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <dl class="faq">
      <dt id="context" class="on">How does
          JMRI tie into the rest of my layout?</dt>
        <dd class="first"><!-- by Jim Betz -->
      <ol>
        <li>JMRI works like a throttle - it sends and listens to
        the messages on the "command bus". Nothing more, nothing
        less. And that is actually - A LOT - and is the true beauty
        of JMRI. In the case of DecoderPro the commands that are
        being used and monitored are those related to programming a
        loco. In the case of PanelPro the messages/commands that
        are being used are those pertinent to block occupancy,
        turnouts, etc.</li>

        <li>Each system has its own "command bus" or "computer
        interface" - i.e. its own set of commands (think 'command
        format') that it uses. This is why you can't use a Digitrax
        throttle on an NCE system. Many people refer to the command
        bus as a "throttle net" - to distinguish it from the track
        bus. And it is important to note that the messages on the
        two are not identical in all cases. Some systems are
        similar enough to each other in order to make it possible
        to use a throttle from one on another ... but this is
        relatively rare (very few layouts actually make use of it).
        Another solution is CMRI - which has its own command set.
        JMRI also is smart enough to "speak CMRI" (as well as the
        ability to "speak" Digitrax and NCE and Lenz ... etc.) The
        difference being is that CMRI is a command set and hardware
        that is focused only on the RR support systems (signals,
        turnouts, etc.) and does not have the ability to control or
        program trains. And, in point of fact, does not "know"
        whether the layout is DC or DCC. Most of the layouts that
        have implemented CMRI recently have used the CMRI hardware
        and JMRI (PanelPro) for the human interface.</li>

        <li>On DCC layouts the command station is the interface
        between the track and the throttle/command bus. You use the
        throttle bus to acquire a loco ... and to send control
        messages to the command station - which 'forwards' your
        throttle changes to the locos ... and to the stationary
        decoders ... via either the track -or- command bus (or
        both).</li>

        <li>It is possible - some will even say desirable - to
        separate your train support (track bus) from your layout
        control support. Although it may not be intuitive - you
        don't have to use the same system that you use to control
        trains to control the turnouts and signals - simply because
        messages don't need to cross that boundary. This is why
        some have recommended you consider an environment such as
        NCE for the trains and CMRI or Digitrax for the layout
        support (PanelPro).</li>

        <li>Because Digitrax and CMRI have published their
        interfaces there are more products available for layout
        control for those two systems than for NCE. Both RR-CirKits
        and Team Digital have excellent products out that work for
        Digitrax (for instance). As far as I know there are no such
        products for NCE. I do not know what is/isn't available for
        Lenz.</li>

        <li>PanelPro is still developing at a rapid rate. Many
        layouts are already up and running using PanelPro - but the
        most recent developments that have just recently been made
        available in PanelPro make using it a -lot- easier than it
        used to be. Actually, if you are talking just turnouts and
        block occupancy then PanelPro has been usable for some
        time. Signaling is getting better all the time.</li>

        <li>When you start doing signaling then "everything
        changes". Because signaling requires that the block
        occupancy and turnout status be used in the decision
        process of "what aspect should be displayed on which
        signals at this point in time". This requires layout
        specific code/logic. I'm assuming that you want a computer
        to make these decisions. It is possible to implement a
        system where a human being, usually the dispatcher, does
        all of the decisions ... the more complex the
        layout/signaling system the more errors the dispatcher will
        make. And there is also the "workload" issue(s)... but a
        computer running PanelPro is usually loafing and has more
        than enough power to keep ahead of the needs of the layout.
        <br>
        Implementing layout control (turnouts, block
        occupancy, signals, etc.) is not an "easy deal". And, in
        my opinion, it is not something you should attempt to
        teach yourself - or to do it alone with just the
        help/guidance of online lists such as this one. I am not
        saying "don't use online" ... I'm saying that if you want
        to do this as easily as possible then you should seek out
        those who have gone before and enlist their face-to-face
        support/guidance. Yes, you can do it your self - no,
        that's not the best way to do this and you will find you
        make -many- mistakes that will cause considerable delays
        and rework. Many layout automation projects have gotten
        stalled for just this very reason.
        <br>
        And just so this gets mentioned ... adding
        capabilities such as block occupancy detection, computer
        controlled turnouts, and signals is not inexpensive and
        needs to be budgeted/spec'd out. And you may find that
        you will need to re-wire some or even major portions of
        your layout in order to support them correctly/at all.

      <dt id="store">How do I save my work?</dt>
      <dd>There are several ways to save
      your panel. This is because the program has to store both
      configuration (turnouts, sensors, etc) and layout (the
      details of your specific panel) information.<br>

      Usually, the easiest way is to use just one file to
      contain everything. For example, you can store your panel(s)
      in a file called "MainPanel.xml" (or something like that),
      and set the preferences to load that file. Then, all you have
      to do is save that file again whenever you change something.
      One caution: Make sure that you still have the panel open
      when you save the file! If you close it, then save the file,
      it will of course write a version of the file that doesn't
      show the panel. And save this file from the "Panels" menu,
      using the "Store Panels..." item.<br>

      This works because panels are stored with all the
      configuration information at that same time (which guarantees
        they'll work when reloaded)</dd>

      <dt id="multifile">Can I store just the
      configuration information?</dt>
      <dd>You
      can store just the "configuration" information in a file,
      which you can save without worrying about whether your
      panel(s) are open, etc. If you do this, you can also save
      your panels to their own, separate files.<br>
        To do this:

      <ul>
        <li>Go to one of the table tools (e.g. Route Table) and
        pick "Store configuration..." from the "File" menu.</li>

        <li>This will let you select a file name; make sure it is
        _NOT_ the same as the panel file name. (e.g. use
        "MyConfig.xml" instead of "MyPanel.xml")</li>

        <li>Remember that name and location, then store.</li>
      </ul>
      This puts config info like Turnouts, Sensors etc, but
      not panels, in the file. If you also want to save your
      currently loaded panels, select "Store Panels and
      Configuration..." instead.
      </dd>

      <dt id="showfile">How can I see my saved
      configuration, including Turnouts etc and panels?</dt>
        <dd>JMRI does not remember the Turnout, Sensor
        or Reporter table entries from
        a previous JMRI session unless you take specific action to save your
        information, and unless you take specific action to instruct JMRI to read
        the saved configuration.  (This is generally also true of the information
        in the other Tables.)<br>
        Once you close and reopen a JMRI application, you have
        to load your configuration information xml file to see
        your Turnouts, Sensors etc. This allows to use JMRI with
        different configurations, or go back to an older version
        of the configuration when an error was made in your
        latest saved version.<br>
        To automatically load the file when the program starts:

        <ul>
            <li>Open the Preferences panel.</li>
            <li>Select the Start-up tab.</li>
            <li>From the drop down list at bottom left, select
            "Add", then "Open File..."</li>
            <li>In the dialog box that opens, select the file in
            which you have stored the configuration/panels.<br>
            A new line with this action is added to the list.</li>
            <li>Click "Save" on the Preferences pane to make sure
            this is stored.</li>
            <li>Quit the program and restart it to test.</li>
        </ul>

        On subsequent JMRI invocations, all start-up actions are invoked,
        including any "start-up" actions you have defined to "Load" a "Panel File".<br>

        If automatic reloading of the table entries is not desired, it is possible
        to manually read a panel file.  Under the JMRI "Panels" menu item, select
        "Open Panel..." and then locate and select one or more panel files
        containing the appropriate information.  Select the "Open Panels" button
        to read those files into JMRI.</dd>

      <dt id="location">Where should I put my custom icons and other
      files?</dt>
      <dd>The best place to put your own files is in the
      JMRI Preferences directory (all JMRI apps use <a href=
      "../../setup/Files.shtml#location">the same directory</a>).
      You should put any locally-modified versions of files here so
      they don't get overwritten by a new version of the program.
      Any files that the program writes to contain local
      information, e.g. roster entries, are also written here.<br>
      The location of this varies by computer type:
      <img src="../../../images/IconFileTree.gif" alt=
      "Screen shot of file tree" align="right" width="288" height=
      "327" hspace="5" vspace="0">

      <ul>
        <li>On a Linux machine, look for a <code>.jmri</code>
        directory in your home directory.</li>

        <li>On a Macintosh, look in the Preferences folder of the
        current System Folder if running MacOS 8 or 9, or the
        Library/Preferences folder in your user directory on Mac OS
        X.</li>

        <li>On Windows, this can be in a number of places depending
        on which Windows version you're running and whether you
        have multiple users configured; Search for a "JMRI"
        directory to find it.</li>
      </ul>
      The easiest way to find the preferences location is to start
      a JMRI program, e.g. DecoderPro or PanelPro, select
      "Locations..." from the "Help" menu and click on [User Files
      Location].<br>
      A special treat for Windows users: if you go to the Windows Start
      Menu, in the JMRI section, you can select
      "Preferences" to have it open that directory for
      you.<br>

      Make sure you go to the preferences, and <em>not</em> the
      original application package. They are kept separate to
      simplify updating the program version. You'll know you've
      found the right place if you see the preferences files that
      store your applications settings:<br>
      <code>PanelProConfig2.xml</code>.<br>
      You can also search for this file to find this directory:
      <br>
      If you have created icons that
      you want to be able from the panel editor, put them in a
      directory called "resources" in the Preferences directory.
      They'll then show up in the "files" part of the selection box
      when you press a "Change icon..." button on the panel
      editor.<br>

      For example, if the Preferences directory contains the
      files shown below, you'll get the file display shown at the
      right.
      <code>&gt; ls resources/ decoderpro.gif green.gif
      icons red.gif tester.gif &gt; ls resources/icons/ something
      tester.gif &gt; ls resources/icons/something/
      tester.gif</code>

      It's also possible to put your files in the
      <code>resources</code> directory within the JMRI distribution
      directory that you get when you install the program. This is
      <em>not</em> recommended, because files there will likely be
      overwritten when you install a future version (a newer
      version of a file, perhaps to fix a problem, will overwrite
      your copy; the replacement is based on the file's date).<br>
