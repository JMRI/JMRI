      <h2>Downloading and installing</h2>

      <p>DecoderPro is distributed as part of the free JMRI downloads. The steps to getting it
      working are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt class="left">Make sure DecoderPro can run on your computer</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          The DecoderPro software will work on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. It will probably also
          work on most other modern operating systems that have Java available; contact us for help
          if you'd like to try it on some other system. You need to have a serial port available,
          either on the computer itself, or via a <a href="../../hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB
          adapter</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Make sure JMRI works with your DCC system</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          The <a href="../../hardware/index.shtml">hardware page</a> lists the DCC systems
          compatible with DecoderPro, along with the known limitations and the available tools.
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Download and install JMRI</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          The <a href="https://jmri.org/download/index.shtml">Download page</a> on the main JMRI
          website provides links to download various JMRI versions, along with links to release
          notes, etc.
          <p>Note that there are different downloads for different types of computers (Macintosh,
          Windows, etc), and the procedures for installing JMRI differ. You'll find all that
          explained on the <a href="https://jmri.org/download/index.shtml">Download page</a>.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Setup JMRI</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          Please consult <a href="../../setup/index.shtml">JMRI Setup Help</a>. When Setup is
          completed, you should have a working DecoderPro installation.
