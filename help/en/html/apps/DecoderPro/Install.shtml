<h1>JMRI: Downloading and installing DecoderPro</h1>

<p>DecoderPro is distributed as part of the free JMRI
downloads.  The steps to getting it working are:

<dl>

<dt class=left>Make sure DecoderPro can run on your computer
</dt><dd class=first>The DecoderPro software will work on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. 
It will probably also work on most
other modern operating systems that have Java available; contact us for
help if you'd like to try it on some other system. You need to have a
serial port available, either on the computer itself, or via a 
<a HREF="../../hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB adapter</a>. 
</dd>


<dt class=left>Make sure JMRI works with your DCC system
</dt><dd class="first">The
<a HREF="../../hardware/index.shtml">hardware page</a>
lists the DCC systems compatible with
DecoderPro, along with the known limitations.
</dd>

<dt class=left>Download and install JMRI
</dt><dd class="first">The 
<a HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/download/index.shtml">download page</a>
on the main JMRI web site
provides links to download various JMRI versions, along
with links to release notes, etc.  We strongly recommend
that you first download and install the most recent production release
and make sure that it's working, before you try some of the 
more recent development releases.
<p>
Note that there are different downloads for the different types
of computer (Macintosh, Windows, etc), and the procedures for
installing the program differ. You'll find all that on the
download page.</p>
</dd>

<dt class="left">Start up and configure the program
</dt><dd class="first">The install instructions
reached through the 
<a HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/download/index.shtml">download page</a>
will have told you how to start up the program and configure 
it.  When that's done, you should have a working DecoderPro
installation.
