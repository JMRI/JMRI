      <h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>

      <h2>Downloading and installing</h2>

      <p>DecoderPro is distributed as part of the free JMRI
      downloads. The steps to getting it working are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt class="left">Make sure DecoderPro can run on your
        computer</dt>

        <dd class="first">The DecoderPro software will work on
        Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. It will probably also work on
        most other modern operating systems that have Java
        available; contact us for help if you'd like to try it on
        some other system. You need to have a serial port
        available, either on the computer itself, or via a <a href=
        "../../hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB adapter</a>.</dd>

        <dt class="left">Make sure JMRI works with your DCC
        system</dt>

        <dd class="first">The <a href=
        "../../hardware/index.shtml">hardware page</a> lists the
        DCC systems compatible with DecoderPro, along with the
        known limitations and the available tools.</dd>

        <dt class="left">Download and install JMRI</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          The <a href=
          "https://jmri.org/download/index.shtml">Download page</a>
          on the main JMRI web site provides links to download
          various JMRI versions, along with links to release notes,
          etc.

          <p>Note that there are different downloads for different
          types of computers (Macintosh, Windows, etc), and the
          procedures for installing JMRI differ. You'll find all
          that explained on the <a href=
          "https://jmri.org/download/index.shtml">Download
          page</a>.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Setup JMRI</dt>

        <dd class="first">Please consult <a href=
        "../../setup/index.shtml">JMRI Setup Help</a>. When Setup
        is completed, you should have a working DecoderPro
        installation.</dd>
