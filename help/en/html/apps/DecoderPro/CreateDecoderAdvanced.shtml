<h1>DecoderPro User Guide - Advanced Decoder Definitions</h1>

<p>This page provides information on advanced features in
the decoder definition
files for the DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer.</p>

<h3>Formatting on the page</h3>
You can do limited formatting on the display using HTML formatting tags.

<p>
You can embed HTML in pane text, but it must be enclosed in &lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt; tags. 

<P>This is made a bit tricky because of overlap between "tags as 
part of XML structure of decoder file" and "HTML tags included in the decoder file".
All of the HTML tags need to be quoted, with their &lt; and &gt; characters
replaced by the &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; strings and any embedded double quotes
being replaced by &amp;quot;.
<p>
For example:
<pre>
   &lt;label label="&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;JMRI 3.7.2 or later is required to use this definition.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;"/&gt;
</pre>
After the XML is read, the contents of that label will be displayed from the text in the "label" attribute, which is:
<pre>
   &lt;html&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JMRI 3.7.2 or later is required to use this definition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
and will appear on the screen as
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>JMRI 3.7.2 or later is required to use this definition.</strong>
<p>
For more examples see
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/jmri/xml/decoders/esu/v4infoPane.xml" target="_blank">
    xml/decoders/esu/v4infoPane.xml</a>.
<p>
This provides only HTML5 support, so if something isn't displaying as you expect, 
see if an approach using simpler HTML will work.

<h3>Identification</h3>
Three pieces:
<dl>
<dt>Manufacturer:</dt><dd>Numerical value from CV8, which is then matched to a name using the 
                    entries in the xml/decoderIndex.xml file.</dd>
<dt>Version code:</dt><dd>Numerical value from CV7, which is then matched to model name(s) using
                    the lowVersionID and highVersionID values on model elements 
                    within all decoder definitions for the specific manufacturer.
                    This is a complex process that doesn't always go well 
                    due to duplicate values, etc.</dd>
<dt>Product code:</dt><dd>a numerical value read from a manufacturer-specific CV or CVs, 
                    this only works for certain manufacturers.  The read process
                    is handled in the code (the jmri.jmrit.decoderdefn.IdentifyDecoder class)
                    and has to be updated each time a manufacturer starts providing this number
                    in a CV. When the product code is present, it should
                    break any degeneracy between overlapping CV7 values within a 
                    decoder family.</dd>
</dl>
For example:
<code><pre>
  &lt;decoder&gt;
    &lt;family name="My Decoder Family" mfg="NMRA"&gt;
      &lt;model model="Model A" lowVersionID="16" highVersionID="19" productID="400" /&gt;
      &lt;/model&gt;
      &lt;model model="Model B" lowVersionID="21" highVersionID="22" productID="401" /&gt;
      &lt;/model&gt;
  &lt;/decoder&gt;
</pre></code>

If the user selects a decoder model manually, that selection sets
all three values for use by when the decoder definition is expanded 
for programming (see section <a href="#conditional">Conditional Decoder Definitions</a> below).

<h3 name="visibility">Pane Visibility</h3>
 
The decoder-config (top-level) element has a showEmptyPanes attribute
that can be used to control whether empty panes (panes with no variables) appear.
<P>By default, or when it's set to showEmptyPanes="yes", empty panes are 
displayed using the logic of the specific program environment (Window has
different highlighting conventions than Linux and Mac).  This is recommended in most cases, e.g. where
there's only one or two panes that end up empty, because it avoids uses saying "Where did the Lights
pane go?"  They see it, see that it's empty, and no questions arise.
<p>
In some cases, e.g. a non-locomotive decoder for servos where none of the locomotive-decoder
panes make sense so the decoder definition contains lots of custom panes, 
it's a simplification to set showEmptyPanes="no" and just remove all those.

<h3 name="include">Including Fragment Files</h3>

Common parts of decoder definitions can be placed into "fragment files", 
which can then be included into multiple decoder definition files.
This makes it easier to maintain and update those common definitions, e.g.
to translate them into other languages.
<p>
By convention, we these fragment files in subdirectories:
<dl>
<dt>xml/decoders/nmra<dd>The NMRA definitions for CVs, used by many decoder types
<dt>xml/decoders/(mfg)<dd>Manufacturer-specific variables, for example xml/decoders/esu
</dl>
The format for an include is:
<code><pre>
     &lt;xi:include href="http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/nmra/shortAndLongAddress.xml"/&gt;
</pre></code>

The program searches for those fragment files first in the preferences directory, 
then in the program directory.  The full path must be present, e.g.
you need an xml directory that contains a decoders directory in your preferences directory for the
fragment file to be found.
<p>
Use an existing file as an example for the top elements & format needed.
 
<h3 name="update">Updates and Migration</h3>

Sometimes, we replace a decoder definition with a better one.  The old one is in use,
but we'd like to move those users to the new one eventually.  There are model-level
attributes that can be added to the old (not the new) definition to facilitate that:

<code><pre>
&lt;model show="no" model="A4X" replacementModel="A4X" replacementFamily="Jan 2012"&gt;
</pre></code>

When the user selects "Update decoder definitions" from the Debug Menu,  
all their existing roster entries that use a decoder definition with replacementModel and/or
replacementFamily defined will be updated to the specified replacement decoder definition
instead.  This lets people keep using their old, comfortable decoder definition (the old
file remains in JMRI) until they decide to move forward to a new one.
<p>
The model element "show" attribute helps ensure that new users
starts with the new definition.
Its possible values are:
<ul>
<li>"yes" (default) - the traditional behavior, always show this model and the family it contains
<li>"no" - never show this model, even if it matches a possible selection.
            Used for legacy (old) definitions that have been replaced with newer ones.
<li>"maybe" - only show if it matches a (possible) automatic identification.
</ul>

To create a completely new definition for an existing model:
<ol>
<li>Decide where you want the new model defined.  It has to have either a new model 
name, a new family name (new file) or both.
<li>Create your definition.
<li>Add "replacementModel" and "replacementFamily" attributes to the old definition.
<li>Generally, set the "show" attribute in the old definition to "no".  The only exception to this
is when some users will want to select the old definition still for a new decoder, perhaps
because automatic identification can tell the uses of the old definition from the new one.
(E.g. you're splitting the old definition into two parts because a new subversion locomotive
exists)
</ol>

<h3>Programming Capabilities</h3>

Some decoders can do extra programming operations, for example bypassing limitations on CV
programming in the command station.  "Capability" elements are used to 
tell DecoderPro about these.

<h4>Access to High CV addresses</h4>

Certain command stations can only access up to CV 256 or CV512.  Some
decoder manufacturers have built in mechanisms to bypass this.  For example,
some ESU decoders can use writes to various CVs to access high-address CVs.
To tell DecoderPro that a decoder can do this, use an element like:
<code><pre>
        &lt;capability&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;High Access via Double Index&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Max Regular CV address"&gt;256&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="High Address CV"&gt;96&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Low Address CV"&gt;97&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Access Register CV"&gt;99&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Modulo"&gt;100&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;/capability&gt;
</pre></code>
<p>
The parameters must appear in the order shown. They mean:<ul>
<li>"Max Regular CV address" - CV addresses equal or below this don't 
    use this mechanism. (The mechanism won't be used if the command
    station can directly read/write the CV being requested, but 
    even if it can't, this mechanism won't be used below this value)
<li>"High Address CV" - The high part (see Modulo) of the CV address
    is written here at the start of the operation
<li>"Low Address CV" - The low part (see Modulo) of the CV address is
    written here as the 2nd part of the operation.
<li>"Access Register CV" - after the address values are set, this is the
    CV that's read or written to read or set the desired real CV.
<li>"Modulo" - value used to split the real CV address between the high and low address
    CVs.
</ul>
<p>
For example, to write 10 to CV 604 with the values shown, DecoderPro will:
<ul>
<li>Write 6 =(604/100) to CV 96 for the high address part
<li>Write 4 = 604 mod 100) to CV 97 for the low address part
<li>Write 10 to CV 99 to do the actual CV write
</ul>
<p>
For an example of where to position this capability element in the file, etc., see the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/jmri/xml/decoders/ESU_LokSoundV4_0.xml" target="_blank">
    xml/decoders/ESU_LokSoundV4_0.xml</a> file.


<h4>Indexed CV Access</h4>

To access indexed CVs via regular variables (not iVariables), include this capability element:
<code><pre>
        &lt;capability&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;Indexed CV access&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="PI"&gt;31&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="SI"&gt;32&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="cvFirst"&gt;false&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;/capability&gt;
</pre></code>
If cvFirst is true, the format is CV.PI or CV.PI.SI as used by QSI.
If it's false, the format is PI.CV or PI.SI.CV as used by ESU.
<p>
If both this and the "access to high CV" capabilities are present, this one
should be listed second.
<p>
For an example of where to position it etc., see the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/jmri/xml/decoders/ESU_LokSoundV4_0.xml" target="_blank">
    xml/decoders/ESU_LokSoundV4_0.xml</a> file.

<h3 id="conditional">Conditional Decoder Definitions</h3>

To reduce the number of decoder definition files needed, each file can 
contain definitions for multiple decoder models.  
JMRI provides ways of adapting the definition to specific models
both when the file is being initially expanded for use, and 
later while the program is working on the definition.
These are particularly useful when using a common fragment file
that might be included by multiple decoder definition files (defining
different-but-similar families)

<h4 name="include">Include/Exclude During Variable Expansion</h4>

Whether a variable element is expanded and used can be made conditional on the 
decoder type using "include" and "exclude" attributes on &lt;variables&gt; and &lt;variable&gt; elements.
<p>
A variable definition will not be expanded and used:
<ul>
<li>If an exclude attribute is present, neither the
decoders product ID, model name, nor family name is found in the exclude list.
<li>If an include attribute is present, at least one of the
decoders product ID, model name, nor family name is found in the include list.
</ul>
Both of these conditions must be true, and it's possible to use 
both include and exclude on the same element, but it's more usual to just 
use one.
<p>
Example:

<pre>
      &lt;variable label="My Variable" CV="72" include="ModelA,400"&gt;
        &lt;decVal/&gt;
      &lt;/variable&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The variable above will only appear when expanding the decoder definition
for ModelA or product ID 400.
<p>
You can also put include and exclude attributes on individual choices in an enumeration-type
variable.  This can be used to e.g. only include specific lighting options in certain
decoder families.
<p>
Attributes on a &lt;variables&gt; element act on all the &lt;variable&gt; elements within it,
along with any include or exclude attributes on those individual variables. 

<h4 name="pane_include">Include/Exclude During Pane Creation</h4>

Whether a pane (or part of a pane) is created can be made conditional on the 
decoder type using "include" and "exclude" attributes on &lt;pane&gt; and &lt;group&gt; elements.
<p>
A pane will not be created:
<ul>
<li>If an exclude attribute is present, neither the
decoders product ID, model name, nor family name is found in the exclude list.
<li>If an include attribute is present, at least one of the
decoders product ID, model name, nor family name is found in the include list.
</ul>
Both of these conditions must be true, and it's possible to use 
both include and exclude on the same element, but it's more usual to just 
use one.
<p>
Example:

<pre>
      &lt;pane label="My Pane" include="ModelA,400"&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/pane&gt;
</pre>

<p>
&quot;My Pane&quot; will be created only when expanding the decoder definition
for ModelA or product ID 400.
<p>
You can also create a &lt;group&gt; element with include and exclude attributes.
Elements within the &lt;group&gt; will be created only if the <group> conditions are met.
This can be used to e.g. display specific text labels only for certain
decoder models.
<p>
Example:

<pre>
      &lt;group include="ModelA,400"&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
          &lt;text&gt;These decoders are very old.&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
          &lt;text&gt;Some features are unavailable.&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;/group&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The text will be created only when expanding the decoder definition
for ModelA or product ID 400.


<h4 name="qualify">Run-time Qualification of Variables</h4>
<h5>Qualifying Variables</h5>

A "qualifier" element on a variable element allows you to enable or disable the variable
depending on the current value of another variable. This can be
useful if, for example, the decoder has a "mode" CV that determines the meaning
of other CVs.
<p>
If a variable is qualified as inactive, it doesn't appear in any 
panes and is neither read nor written to the decoder when you do "All" or "Changes only" 
read or write operations.  The value is saved to the roster and will be
reloaded when the roster entry is reopened later.

<p>In the following example, 
a CV is interpreted as two different variables depending on whether the 
decoder is set for short or long addressing.

<pre>
  &lt;variable label="Variable for Short Address" CV="11"&gt;
    &lt;qualifier&gt;
      &lt;variableref&gt;Address Format&lt;/variableref&gt;
      &lt;relation&gt;eq&lt;/relation&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;0&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/qualifier&gt;
    &lt;decVal/&gt;
  &lt;/variable&gt;
  &lt;variable label="Variable for Long Address" CV="11"&gt;
    &lt;qualifier&gt;
      &lt;variableref&gt;Address Format&lt;/variableref&gt;
      &lt;relation&gt;eq&lt;/relation&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;1&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/qualifier&gt;
    &lt;decVal/&gt;
  &lt;/variable&gt;
</pre>

Other available operators include "gt", "ge", "ne", "lt", "le" and "exists".
The "exists" operator checks for whether a variable is defined or not; a "1" value
means that it is, and a "0" means that it doesn't.

<p>
If multiple qualifier elements are present, all must be true for the 
variable to be active and displayed.

<h5 name="panes">Qualifying Panes</h5>

A "qualifier" element on a pane element allows you to enable or disable the pane
depending on the current value of a variable. 

<p>If a pane is qualified as inactive, its contents are no longer shown.
This includes any labels or other decorations on the pane, in addition to the
variables it contains.
Depending on other options, the pane may either show as empty, or not show
at all.  The variables within it are still active, though, and a 
"Read all sheets" or "Write all sheets" will still write them.
If you have overlapping variable definitions, consider carefully whether
this is what you want. You might need to qualify the individual overlapping variables.

<p>The following example enables
one of two panes depending on whether the decoder is currently set for short or
long addressing.

<pre>
  &lt;pane name="Short Only"&gt;
    &lt;qualifier&gt;
      &lt;variableref&gt;Address Format&lt;/variableref&gt;
      &lt;relation&gt;eq&lt;/relation&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;0&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/qualifier&gt;
    &lt;column&gt;&lt;row&gt;
      &lt;label label="Short Only Pane"/&gt;
    &lt;/row&gt;&lt;/column&gt;
  &lt;/pane&gt;
  &lt;pane name="Long Only"&gt;
    &lt;qualifier&gt;
      &lt;variableref&gt;Address Format&lt;/variableref&gt;
      &lt;relation&gt;eq&lt;/relation&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;1&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/qualifier&gt;
    &lt;column&gt;&lt;row&gt;
      &lt;label label="Long Only Pane"/&gt;
    &lt;/row&gt;&lt;/column&gt;
  &lt;/pane&gt;
</pre>

Other available operators include "gt", "ge", "ne", "lt" and "le".
<p>
If multiple qualifier elements are present, all must be true for the 
pane to be active and displayed.

<h5 name="labels">Qualifying Elements on Panes</h5>

A "qualifier" element on a "label", "soundlabel", "row", "column", "grid" or "griditem" element
allows you to enable or disable the  display of that element on a specific pane.

<p>The following example displays a warning label if a version-number
variable has a too-low value:
<pre>
    &lt;label label="Version number too low!"&gt;
      &lt;qualifier&gt;
        &lt;variableref&gt;Version Number&lt;/variableref&gt;
        &lt;relation&gt;lt&lt;/relation&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;3&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/qualifier&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  You can use the same qualifier for multiple elements by enclosing the elements in a
  "group" element and adding the qualifier to the "group" element:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;group&gt;
      &lt;qualifier&gt;
        &lt;variableref&gt;Version Number&lt;/variableref&gt;
        &lt;relation&gt;lt&lt;/relation&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;3&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/qualifier&gt;
      &lt;label label="Version number too low!"/&gt;
      &lt;label label=" "/&gt;
      &lt;label label="Please update."/&gt;
    &lt;/group&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Once you've read the Version Number (variable or CV) from the decoder,
  the label(s) will display iff that version number is too low.  Note
  that initially, before the values are read from the decoder, this 
  display will depend on the default value from the file, which might
  be misleading to the user.
