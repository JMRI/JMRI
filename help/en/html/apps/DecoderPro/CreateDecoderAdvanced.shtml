      <h2>Advanced Decoder Definitions</h2>

      <p>This page provides information on advanced features in the
      decoder definition files for the DecoderPro Symbolic
      Programmer.</p><a name="html_formatting" id=
      "html_formatting"></a>

      <h3>Formatting on the page</h3>You can do limited formatting
      on the display using HTML formatting tags.

      <p>You can embed HTML in pane text, but it must be enclosed
      in &lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt; tags.</p>

      <p>This is made a bit tricky because of overlap between "tags
      as part of XML structure of decoder file" and "HTML tags
      included in the decoder file". All of the HTML tags need to
      be quoted, with their &lt; and &gt; characters replaced by
      the &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; strings and any embedded double
      quotes being replaced by &amp;quot;.</p>

      <p>For example:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   &lt;label label="&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;JMRI 3.7.2 or later is required to use this definition.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;"/&gt;
</pre>After the XML is read, the contents of that label will be
displayed from the text in the "label" attribute, which is:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   &lt;html&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JMRI 3.7.2 or later is required to use this definition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>and will appear on the screen as

      <p>   <strong>JMRI 3.7.2 or later is required to use this
      definition.</strong></p>

      <p>For more examples see <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/xml/decoders/esu/v4readMePane.xml"
      target="_blank">xml/decoders/esu/v4readMePane.xml</a>.</p>

      <p>This provides only HTML5 support, so if something isn't
      displaying as you expect, see if an approach using simpler
      HTML will work.</p>

      <h3>Identification</h3>
      When "Read Type from Decoder" is used to determine the correct
      decoder definition file, several pieces of information
      are read from the decoder and used to attempt a match
      to a family and model:

      <dl>
        <dt>Manufacturer:</dt>

        <dd>Numerical value from CV8, which is then matched to a
        name using the entries in the xml/decoderIndex.xml
        file.</dd>

        <dt>Version code:</dt>

        <dd>Numerical value from CV7, which is then matched to
        model name(s) using the lowVersionID and highVersionID
        values on model elements within all decoder definitions for
        the specific manufacturer. This is a complex process that
        doesn't always go well due to duplicate values, etc.</dd>

        <dt>Product ID code:</dt>

        <dd>
        Originally a numerical value read from a
        manufacturer-specific CV or CVs; this only works for
        certain manufacturers. The read process is handled in the
        code (the <a href=
        "/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/decoderdefn/IdentifyDecoder.html" target="_blank">
        jmri.jmrit.decoderdefn.IdentifyDecoder</a> class) and has
        to be updated each time a manufacturer starts providing
        values in one or more new CVs. When the product code is
        present, it should break any degeneracy between
        overlapping CV7 values within a decoder family.
        For example:
        <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  &lt;decoder&gt;
    &lt;family name="My Decoder Family" mfg="NMRA"&gt;
      &lt;model model="Model A" lowVersionID="16" highVersionID="23" productID="400" /&gt;
      &lt;/model&gt;
      &lt;model model="Model B" lowVersionID="21" highVersionID="27" productID="401" /&gt;
      &lt;/model&gt;
    &lt;/family&gt;
    &#8230;
  &lt;/decoder&gt;</pre>

        <p>Some decoders can have multiple possible stored Product IDs for
        otherwise-identical decoders. In this case multiple comma-separated
        values can be specified in the Product ID field and a match to any
        value in the list will identify the decoder uniquely. For example, the ESU
        series usesthe RailCom&reg; Product ID CVs, but the
        Product ID is updated for various production batches of the same model:</p>
        <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  &lt;decoder&gt;
    &lt;family name="ESU LokSound V4.0" mfg="Electronic Solutions Ulm GmbH" lowVersionID="255" highVersionID="255"&gt;
      &lt;model model="LokSound V4.0" numOuts="92" numFns="40" extFnsESU="yes" productID="33554493,33554503,33554538"&gt;
      &lt;/model&gt;
      &lt;model model="LokSound V4.0 M4" numOuts="92" numFns="40" extFnsESU="yes" productID="33554500,33554536"&gt;
      &lt;/model&gt;
    &lt;/family&gt;
    &#8230;
  &lt;/decoder&gt;</pre>

      <a name="idwarn" id="idwarn"></a>
          <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not use multiple possible stored Product IDs for
          similar decoders that need different
          <a href="#conditional">conditional expansion</a>.
          It will not work, for reasons explained <a href="#prodidwarn">in a section below</a>.
          In this case, each Product ID must be assigned a different model name, as in the first example above.

          <p>Support is also being added to find this value using
          the <a href=
          "../../hardware/loconet/Addressing.shtml#SVs" target="_blank">LocoNet SV2
          protocol</a> some time during the JMRI 4.1 release
          series. See the release notes for more info on the
          progress.</p>

          <p>Since the product code works with the include/exclude
          operations described below, you can also use it in cases
          where there's no CV or CVs that contain it. In that case,
          no automated ID is done, but the value from the productID
          attribute of the user-selected model is used during later
          processing and expansion of the decoder definition.
          Alphanumeric productID values are sometimes used for this
          to avoid conflicts with the numeric ones found in
          CVs.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
        <p>When a decoder model is selected,
        either manually or as the result of the identification process,
        the family and model names are stored in the roster entry being created
        and are used for future linkage of a roster entry to a decoder definition.</p>

        <p>It is important to note that the Manufacturer, Version Code or
        Product ID are not stored in the roster entry, as the values are not
        reliably determined in some instances
        (e.g. manual selection, firmware update by manufacturer-supplied software,
        updated ID information from vendor).
        This has implications for when the decoder definition is expanded for programming
        (<a href="#conditional">Conditional Decoder Definitions</a>)
        or updated
        (<a href="#update">Updates and Migration</a>).</p>

        <h4>Public-domain and DIY decoders</h4>

        <span class="since">Since <a href="/releasenotes/jmri4.11.5.shtml" target="_blank">JMRI 4.11.5</a></span>

        <p>The "Read Type from Decoder" feature is available for Public-domain and DIY decoders.</p>

        <p>Three identifiers are used to identify the decoder:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Manufacturer:</dt>

                <dd>Numeric value <b>CV8 = 13</b> according to the NMRA standard S-9.2.2.
                file.</dd>

                <dt>Version code:</dt>

                <dd>The numeric value from <b>CV7</b> where the software version is stored.</dd>

                <dt>Product ID code:</dt>

                <dd>Numeric value stored in <b>CV47</b>, <b>CV48</b>, <b>CV49</b> and <b>CV50</b> 
                according to NMRA standard S-9.2.2 file and reserved for use by the manufacturer.

                    <p>Product ID is calculated using the following formula:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Product ID = (((CV47 * 256) + CV48) * 256 + CV49) * 256 + CV50</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Individual CVs have the following meaning:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>CV47 - country code, for example CV47 = 1 for the Czech Republic</li>
                        <li>CV48 - developer or group of developers code, such as CV48 = 1 for dccdoma.cz</li>
                        <li>CV49 - third ProductID for further identification</li>
                        <li>CV50 - fourth ProductID for further identification</li>
                    </ul>
                </dd>
            </dl>

        <p>The corresponding decoder definition xml file has a filled &lt;family&gt; element. Example:</p>
    
       <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  &lt;decoder&gt;
    &lt;family name="dccdoma.cz" mfg="Public-domain and DIY" &gt;
      &lt;model model="UNI16ARD-NAV" lowVersionID="41" productID="16843010" &#8230;  /&gt;
    &lt;/family&gt;
    &#8230;
  &lt;/decoder&gt;</pre>

        <p>The individual attributes of this element must be filled in as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>mfg="Public-domain and DIY"</b> that matches CV8</li>
            <li><b>lowVersionID="nn" highVersionID="mm"</b> that matches CV7</li>
            <li><b>productID="nnnnnn"</b> that matches CV47, CV48, CV49 and CV50</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The name of the xml file with the definition of the decoder should have the following structure:</p>

        <pre style="font-family: monospace;"><b>Public_Domain</b>_<b>family-name</b>_<b>model-model</b>.xml</pre>

        <p>Where each part of a file name has the following meaning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Public_Domain</b> that matches attribute &lt;family mfg="Public-domain and DIY" &gt;</li>
            <li><b>family-name</b> that matches attribute &lt;family name="developer" &gt;</li>
            <li><b>model-model</b> that matches attribute &lt;model model="decoder name" &gt;</li>
        </ul>

      <a name="pane_considerations" id="pane_considerations"></a>
      <h3>Pane Considerations</h3>Programmer panes are used to
      split and organise decoder variables into convenient named
      categories.

      <ul>
        <li>JMRI provides a standard set of panes, defined by
        &lt;pane&gt; elements included in the &lt;programmer&gt;
        element of each of the standard Programmer files (Basic,
        Comprehensive, Advanced, etc.) in the xml/programmers/
        folder.</li>

        <li>Decoder definition files can contain custom panes for
        particular decoders or families of decoders, defined by
        &lt;pane&gt; elements included in the
        &lt;decoder-config&gt; (top-level) element of the decoder
        file.</li>

        <li>Pane names are specified by a &lt;name&gt; element at
        the top of each &lt;pane&gt; element.</li>
      </ul><a name="pane_replacement" id="pane_replacement"></a>

      <h4>Pane Replacement</h4>Custom panes are usually added to
      definition files for one of the following reasons:

      <ol type="A">
        <li>The items to be shown do not fall into any of the
        categories defined by the standard pane names.

          <ul>
            <li>In this case the pane &lt;name&gt; element should
            be different from any existing standard names.</li>

            <li>The new custom pane will be added at the end of the
            pane list.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>The applicable standard pane category does not have the
        correct layout or number of variables.

          <ul>
            <li>In this case the pane &lt;name&gt; element should
            exactly match the existing standard pane &lt;name&gt;
            element.</li>

            <li>The new custom pane will
            <strong><em>replace</em></strong> the existing
            same-named standard pane.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Empty Panes</h4>Empty panes are defined as those with no
      active variable elements to display for the selected decoder.
      They may still contain text content. <a name=
      "pane_visibility" id="pane_visibility"></a> <a name=
      "visibility" id="visibility"></a>

      <h4>Pane Visibility</h4>Pane visibility is governed by a
      complex set of rules:

      <ul>
        <li>Irrespective of all other rules, a pane will not show
        if it fails any <a href="#pane_include">"include" or
        "exclude" attributes</a> in its &lt;pane&gt; element.</li>

        <li>Empty pane visibilty is controlled by the following, in
        increasing order of priority:

          <ul>
            <li>The Preferences-&gt;Roster-&gt;Programmer-&gt;Show
            Empty Tabs setting.</li>

            <li>If present, a showEmptyPanes attribute in the
            current programmer XML file.</li>

            <li>If present, a showEmptyPanes attribute in the
            specific decoder defintiion XML file.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Whether a specific empty pane (as defined in Empty
        Panes above) shows also depends on the pane type:

          <ul>
            <li>If the empty pane is a standard pane (as defined in
            <a href="#pane_considerations">Pane Considerations</a>
            above), it will only show if showEmptyPanes is in
            force. <em>However, its usual contents will be replaced
            by a generic message explaining that the pane is unused
            since the contents are inapplicable or appear on
            another pane.</em></li>

            <li>If the empty pane is a replacement pane (as defined
            in item B of <a href="#pane_replacement">Pane
            Replacement</a> above), it will only show if
            showEmptyPanes is in force.</li>

            <li>If the empty pane is a custom pane (as defined in
            item A of <a href="#pane_replacement">Pane
            Replacement</a> above), it will always show,
            irrespective of whether showEmptyPanes is in
            force.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><a name="pane_best_practice" id=
      "pane_best_practice"></a>

      <h4>Best Pactice</h4>Advanced users may choose to hide empty
      panes, but Show Empty Tabs is enabled by default so beginner
      users need to see why panes are empty or where to find items
      not on the expected panes.

      <p>The recommended best practice is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Where possible, items should use the existing standard
        panes.</li>

        <li>Where a particular existing standard pane does not suit
        in terms of number of items or layout:

          <ul>
            <li>Create a <a href="#pane_replacement">replacement
            pane</a> with the same name as the existing standard
            pane.</li>

            <li>For examples, see the Advanced and Sound panes of
            the <a href=
            "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/xml/decoders/ESU_LokSoundV4_0.xml"
            target="_blank">ESU_LokSoundV4_0</a> decoder
            definition.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Where an existing standard pane does not suit in terms
        of concept:

          <ul>
            <li>Create one or more new <a href=
            "#pane_replacement">custom panes</a> with unique
            descriptive names.</li>

            <li>Create information-only (no variable display
            elements, just text) <a href=
            "#pane_replacement">replacement panes</a> with the same
            names as any existing unused standard panes. Use these
            panes to explain why each pane is unused and/or where
            to find the information a user may reasonably expect to
            find on this pane. Use <a href="#html_formatting">HTML
            formatting</a> to enhance the display of these
            explanatory panes.</li>

            <li>For examples, see the Lights and Sound Levels panes
            of the <a href=
            "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/xml/decoders/ESU_LokSoundV4_0.xml"
            target="_blank">ESU_LokSoundV4_0</a> decoder
            definition.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Information-only <a href="#pane_replacement">custom
        panes</a> will <em>always</em> be displayed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In some cases, e.g. a non-locomotive decoder for servos
      where none of the locomotive-decoder panes make sense so the
      decoder definition contains lots of custom panes, it's a
      simplification to put a showEmptyPanes="no" attribute in the
      &lt;decoder-config&gt; element of the definition XML and just
      hide all those empty panes by default. <a name="frag_include"
      id="frag_include"></a></p>

      <h3>Including Fragment Files</h3>Common parts of decoder
      definitions can be placed into "fragment files", which can
      then be included into multiple decoder definition files. This
      makes it easier to maintain and update those common
      definitions, e.g. to translate them into other languages.

      <p>By convention, we these fragment files in
      subdirectories:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>xml/decoders/nmra</dt>

        <dd>The NMRA definitions for CVs, used by many decoder
        types</dd>

        <dt>xml/decoders/(mfg)</dt>

        <dd>Manufacturer-specific variables, for example
        xml/decoders/esu</dd>
      </dl>The format for an include is:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
     &lt;xi:include href="http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/nmra/shortAndLongAddress.xml"/&gt;
</pre>The program searches for those fragment files first in the
preferences directory, then in the program directory. The full path
must be present, e.g. you need an xml directory that contains a
decoders directory in your preferences directory for the fragment
file to be found.

      <p>Use an existing file as an example for the top elements
      &amp; format needed.</p>

    <a name="update" id="update"></a>
      <h3>Updates and Migration</h3>
      Sometimes, we replace a decoder
      definition with a better one. The old one is in use, but we'd
      like to move those users to the new one eventually. There are
      model-level attributes that can be added to the old (not the
      new) definition to facilitate that:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    &lt;model show="no" model="A4X" replacementModel="A4X" replacementFamily="Jan 2012"&gt;
      </pre>
When the user selects "Update Decoder Definitions" from the
Debug menu on PanelPro window or the Action menu in DecoderPro, all
their existing roster entries that use a decoder definition with
replacementModel and/or replacementFamily defined will be updated
to the specified replacement decoder definition instead. This lets
people keep using their old, comfortable decoder definition (the
old file remains in JMRI) until they decide to move forward to a
new one.
<p>Note that an update defined this way is unconditional; if the family and model attributes match
a roster entry, it will be updated to the new family/model.
Automated conditional updates based on versionID or productID are not possible
as these values are <a href="#id">not stored</a> in the roster entry.
An interactive update process is now available in these cases
and uses a special syntax:
<span class="since">Since <a href="/releasenotes/jmri4.9.5.shtml" target="_blank">JMRI 4.9.5</a></span>

      </pre>
<p>A replacement field begining with the string  &quot;query:&quot;,
    optionally (preferably) followed by a vertical bar &quot;&#124;&quot; separated list of possible replacements,
    triggers interactive user dialogs, containing further explanations and guidance for the user.

      <p>The model element "show" attribute helps ensure that new
      users starts with the new definition. Its possible values
      are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"yes" (default) - the traditional behavior, always show
        this model and the family it contains</li>

        <li>"no" - never show this model, even if it matches a
        possible selection. Used for legacy (old) definitions that
        have been replaced with newer ones.</li>

        <li>"maybe" - only show if it matches a (possible)
        automatic identification.</li>
      </ul>To create a completely new definition for an existing
      model:

      <ol>
        <li>Decide where you want the new model defined. It has to
        have either a new model name, a new family name (new file)
        or both.</li>

        <li>Create your definition.</li>

        <li>Add "replacementModel" and "replacementFamily"
        attributes to the old definition.</li>

        <li>Generally, set the "show" attribute in the old
        definition to "no". The only exception to this is when some
        users will want to select the old definition still for a
        new decoder, perhaps because automatic identification can
        tell the uses of the old definition from the new one. (E.g.
        you're splitting the old definition into two parts because
        a new locomotive version exists)</li>
      </ol>

      <a name="capability" id="capability"></a><h3>Programming Capabilities</h3>
      Some decoders can do extra
      programming operations, for example bypassing limitations on
      CV programming in the command station. "Capability" elements
      are used to tell DecoderPro about these.

      <h4>Access to High CV addresses</h4>
      Certain command stations
      can only access up to CV 256 or CV512. Some decoder
      manufacturers have built in mechanisms to bypass this. For
      example, some ESU decoders can use writes to various CVs to
      access high-address CVs. To tell DecoderPro that a decoder
      can do this, use an element like:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    &lt;capability&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;High Access via Double Index&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;parameter name="Max Regular CV address"&gt;256&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;parameter name="High Address CV"&gt;96&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;parameter name="Low Address CV"&gt;97&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;parameter name="Access Register CV"&gt;99&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;parameter name="Modulo"&gt;100&lt;/parameter&gt;
    &lt;/capability&gt;
</pre>

      <p>The parameters must appear in the order shown. They
      mean:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Max Regular CV address" - CV addresses equal or below
        this don't use this mechanism. (The mechanism won't be used
        if the command station can directly read/write the CV being
        requested, but even if it can't, this mechanism won't be
        used below this value)</li>

        <li>"High Address CV" - The high part (see Modulo) of the
        CV address is written here at the start of the
        operation</li>

        <li>"Low Address CV" - The low part (see Modulo) of the CV
        address is written here as the 2nd part of the
        operation.</li>

        <li>"Access Register CV" - after the address values are
        set, this is the CV that's read or written to read or set
        the desired real CV.</li>

        <li>"Modulo" - value used to split the real CV address
        between the high and low address CVs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For example, to write 21 to CV 614 with the values shown,
      DecoderPro will:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Write 6 =(614/100) to CV 96 for the high address
        part</li>

        <li>Write 14 = (614 mod 100) to CV 97 for the low address
        part</li>

        <li>Write 21 to CV 99 to do the actual CV write</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For an example of where to position this capability
      element in the file, etc., see the <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/xml/decoders/ESU_LokSoundV4_0.xml"
      target="_blank">xml/decoders/ESU_LokSoundV4_0.xml</a>
      file.</p>

      <p><a name="zimocapability" id="zimocapability"></a> Another
      approach, used by e.g. Zimo, is to provide a way to page the
      access. For example, to write 21 to CV614 with one of these,
      you need to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Write 60 =(614/100)*10 to CV 7 for the high address
        part</li>

        <li>Write 21 to CV 14 (614 mod 100) to do the actual CV
        write</li>
      </ul>This capability element will do that:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &lt;capability&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;High Access via Partial Index&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Max Regular CV address"&gt;100&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="High Address CV"&gt;7&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="High Address Multiplier"&gt;10&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Modulo"&gt;100&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;/capability&gt;
</pre>Note that it has a different "name" value. That's what
selects the different algorithm needed here.

      <p>The parameters must appear in the order shown. They
      mean:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Max Regular CV address" - CV addresses equal or below
        this don't use this mechanism. (The mechanism won't be used
        if the command station can directly read/write the CV being
        requested, but even if it can't, this mechanism won't be
        used below this value)</li>

        <li>"High Address CV" - The high part (see Modulo) of the
        CV address is written here at the start of the
        operation</li>

        <li>"High Address Multiplier" - This multiplies the high
        part of the CV address before it's stored to the High
        Address CV. For example, putting a 10 here will store the
        high address part in the "10's digit" of the High Address
        CV.</li>

        <li>"Modulo" - value used to split the real CV address
        between the high and low address CVs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><a id="zimobis" name="zimobis"></a> Another approach used
      by e.g. Zimo uses a page register that has to be reset
      afterwards. For example, to write 21 to CV614 with one of
      these, you need to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Write 260 =(614/100)*10+200 to CV 7 for the high
        address part. The "200" is an indicator to use this
        mode.</li>

        <li>Write 21 to CV 14 (614 mod 100) to do the actual CV
        write</li>

        <li>Write 0 back to CV7 to reset the indexing.</li>
      </ul>This capability element will do that:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &lt;capability&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;High Access via Partial Index with Reset&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Max Regular CV address"&gt;100&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="High Address CV"&gt;7&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="High Address Multiplier"&gt;10&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Modulo"&gt;100&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Indicator"&gt;200&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;/capability&gt;
</pre>

      <p>The parameters must appear in the order shown. They
      mean:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Max Regular CV address" - CV addresses equal or below
        this don't use this mechanism. (The mechanism won't be used
        if the command station can directly read/write the CV being
        requested, but even if it can't, this mechanism won't be
        used below this value)</li>

        <li>"High Address CV" - The high part (see Modulo) of the
        CV address is written here at the start of the
        operation</li>

        <li>"High Address Multiplier" - This multiplies the high
        part of the CV address before it's stored to the High
        Address CV. For example, putting a 10 here will store the
        high address part in the "10's digit" of the High Address
        CV.</li>

        <li>"Modulo" - value used to split the real CV address
        between the high and low address CVs.</li>

        <li>"Indicator" - value added to the value being stored to
        High Address CV to tell the decoder to use this mode.</li>
      </ul>

      <a id="accessoryops" name="accessoryops"></a>
      <h4>Accessory Decoder Ops Mode</h4>
      Certain accessory decoders require special
      programming packets to configure their CVs from the DCC track signal.
      The capability to do that is written:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &lt;capability&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;Ops Mode Accessory Programming&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Address Type"&gt;decoder&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Delay"&gt;200&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;/capability&gt;
</pre>The "Address Type" parameter is optional:
      <ul>
          <li>If it is "decoder" or omitted, the current address is interpreted as a 9-bit accessory decoder address.</li>
          <li>If it is "accessory" or "output", the current address is interpreted as an 11-bit accessory output address.</li>
          <li>If it is "signal", the current address is interpreted as an 11-bit signal decoder address.</li>
          <li>
              If it is "altsignal", the current address is interpreted as an 11-bit signal decoder address,
              using an alternative interpretation of
              <a href="https://www.nmra.org/sites/default/files/s-9.2.1_2012_07.pdf"
                target="_blank">NMRA standard 9.2.1</a>).
           </li>
          <li>
              If it is "legacy", the current address is interpreted as a 9-bit address (as for "decoder")
              but a "legacy" programming packet (as per Appendix A of
              <a href="https://www.nmra.org/sites/default/files/s-9.2.1_2012_07.pdf"
                target="_blank">NMRA standard 9.2.1</a>)
           is sent.
          </li>
      </ul>
      The "Delay" parameter is optional and specifies a minimum delay (in milliseconds)
      between successive writes. Some decoders will miss commands if the delay is too short.
      If this is parameter is omitted, the default delay is 500 milliseconds.
       <p>
        Note that this only works for
        ops-mode writes; these particular NMRA DCC packets do not perform
        read operations, nor do they work in the service mode (programming
        track).
      </p>

      Note an element:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &lt;variable &#8230; item="Short Address" &#8230;&gt;
            &#8230;
        &lt;/variable&gt;</pre>
      or:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &lt;variable &#8230; item="Long Address" &#8230;&gt;
            &#8230;
        &lt;/variable&gt;</pre>
      is required so the Ops Mode programmer has an address to use.
      Either form functions identically.
      The "Address Type" parameter is the only way to specify whether the address is 9-bit or 11-bit.
      <p>For a working example, see the
      <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/xml/decoders/ESU_SwitchPilot.xml"
      target="_blank">xml/decoders/ESU_SwitchPilot.xml</a> file.
      In the case of this example decoder, the address is stored in CVs 1 and 9 as per
      <a href=
      "http://www.nmra.org/sites/default/files/standards/sandrp/pdf/s-9.2.2_decoder_cvs_2012.07.pdf"
            target="_blank">
      NMRA standard 9.2.2</a>.
      </p>

      <a id="opsdelayed" name="opsdelayed"></a>
      <h4>Ops Mode Delayed Programming</h4>
       <p>
      Most locomotive decoders accept special programming packets
      to configure their CVs from the DCC track signal (Programming on Main).
      </p>
      However these packets take time to process and if subsequent packets are sent
      too soon they can be missed.
      The capability to do add a delay after programming each CV is written:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &lt;capability&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;Ops Mode Delayed Programming&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Delay"&gt;500&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;/capability&gt;
</pre>The "Delay" parameter specifies
      a minimum delay (in milliseconds) between successive writes.
      Some decoders miss commands if the delay is too short.
      If this is parameter is omitted, the default delay is 500 milliseconds.
       <p>
        Note that this only works for
        ops-mode writes; these particular NMRA DCC packets do not perform
        read operations, nor do they work in the service mode (programming track).
      </p>
       <p>
        Note also that this particular capability only works for multi-function
        decoders. Accessory decoders need to use the
        <a href="#accessoryops">Accessory Decoder Ops Mode</a>
        capability, which has its own "Delay" parameter.
      </p>

      <a name="indexedcap" id="indexedcap"></a>
      <h4>Indexed CV Access</h4>
      To access indexed CVs, include this
      capability element:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &lt;capability&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;Indexed CV access&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="PI"&gt;31&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="SI"&gt;32&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="cvFirst"&gt;false&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="skipDupIndexWrite"&gt;true&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;/capability&gt;
</pre>
      <p>If cvFirst is true, the format is CV.PI or CV.PI.SI as used
        by QSI. If it's false, the format is PI.CV or PI.SI.CV as used by
        ESU.
        
      <p>Alternately the PI and/or SI CV numbers can be set by using a "nn=nn" syntax when specifying
        PI and/or SI.  For example, using a cvFirst false syntax, "101=12.80" sets CV101 to 12 before
        accessing CV 80, regardless of the PI value configured into the capability.

      <p>If skipDupIndexWrite is true, certain writes to the PI and SI
        CVs can be skipped if the user selects skipping them. This speeds up access.
        Some decoders  require that the CVs be written for each operation, 
        in which case this should be set to false.  The default is true.
      
      <p>If both this and the "access to high CV" capabilities are
      present, this one should be listed second.</p>

      <p>For an example of where to position it etc., see the

      <h4>TCS WOW decoder access</h4>The TCS WOW decoders use
      several unique (to say the least) CV access methods. JMRI
      accommodates them via a special capability element:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &lt;capability&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;TCS 4 CV access&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;/capability&gt;
</pre>This provides two custom CV formats:

      <ul>
        <li>T2CV.11.12 Writes 11 to the first index CV (201), 12 to
        the 2nd index CV (202), then does write/read/confirm
        operations on CV 203 and 204</li>

        <li>T3CV.11.12.13 Writes 11 to the first index CV (201),
        the data to the 2nd index CV (202), then writes 12 to CV203
        and 13 to CV204.</li>
      </ul>For examples of how to use these, see the TCS WOW
      decoder definition.

      <span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.15.5.shtml">JMRI 4.15.5</a></span>

      The original technique of specifying a "CV" and a "highCV" is not appropriate
      in cases where many more CVs are needed. Alternative more concise methods of specifying

      <ul>
          <li>

      <h4>splitVal example - "long" addresses over 2 CVs</h4>

      <p>Some decoders, mostly accessory decoders, are using "long"
      addresses that are split over 2 CVs, contiguous or not.</p>

      <p>CV1 and CV9 are standardized by NMRA for accessory
      decoders primary address, see <a href=
      "http://www.nmra.org/sites/default/files/standards/sandrp/pdf/s-9.2.2_decoder_cvs_2012.07.pdf">
      NMRA standard 9.2.2</a>.</p>

      <p>Long addresses can be accessed via "splitVal" type, as in
      the following example:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    &lt;variable CV="1" item="Short Address" default="1" minOut="1"&gt;
        &lt;splitVal highCV="9" upperMask="XXXXXVVV"/&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;Accessory Address&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/variable&gt;
</pre>

      <p>The declared "CV" is the LSB (Least Significant Byte)
      whereas the "highCV" is the MSB (Most Significant Byte).</p>

      <p>splitVal actually has two parameters, a "Factor" and an
      "Offset":</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Value to put in CVs = ((value in text field) -
        Offset)/Factor</li>

        <li>Value to put in text field = ((value in CVs) * Factor)
        + Offset</li>
      </ul>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    &lt;splitVal highCV="9" factor="4" offset="-3"/&gt;
</pre>

      <p>For an example, see the <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/xml/decoders/SPROG_DCC_Servo6.xml"

      file.</p>

      
      <a name="conditional" id="conditional"></a>
      <h3>Conditional Decoder Definitions</h3>To reduce the number
      of decoder definition files needed, each file can contain
      definitions for multiple decoder models. JMRI provides ways
      of adapting the definition to specific models both when the
      file is being initially expanded for use, and later while the
      program is working on the definition. These are particularly
      useful when using a common fragment file that might be
      included by multiple decoder definition files (defining
      different-but-similar families) <a name="var_include" id=
      "var_include"></a>

      <h4>Include/Exclude During Variable Expansion</h4>Whether a
      variable element is expanded and used can be made conditional
      on the decoder type using "include" and "exclude" attributes
      on &lt;variables&gt;, &lt;variable&gt;,
      &lt;enumChoice&gt; and &lt;enumChoiceGroup&gt; elements.

      <p>A variable definition will not be expanded and used:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If an exclude attribute is present, neither the
        decoders product ID, model name, nor family name is found
        in the exclude list.</li>

        <li>If an include attribute is present, at least one of the
        decoders product ID, model name, or family name is found
        in the include list.</li>
      </ul>Both of these conditions must be true, and it's possible
      to use both include and exclude on the same element, but it's
      more usual to just use one.

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
      &lt;variable label="My Variable" CV="72" include="ModelA,400"&gt;
        &lt;decVal/&gt;
      &lt;/variable&gt;
</pre>

      <p>The variable above will only appear when expanding the
      decoder definition for ModelA or product ID 400.</p>

      <p>You can also put include and exclude attributes on
      individual choices in an enumeration-type variable. This can
      be used to e.g. only include specific lighting options in
      certain decoder families.</p>

      <p>Attributes on a &lt;variables&gt; element act on all the
      &lt;variable&gt; elements within it, along with any include
      or exclude attributes on those individual
      variables.</p>
      
      <p>You can also use the include mechanism
      to specify the default value of a variable.
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
      &lt;variable label="My Variable" CV="72" default="3"&gt;
        &lt;defaultItem default="12" include="815"/&gt;  
        &lt;decVal/&gt;
      &lt;/variable&gt;
</pre>
      <p>This will set the default (initial) value
      of the CV to 12 if the "815" matches, 
      and otherwise use the default-default of 3.
      You can have as many defaultItem elements
      as needed; the first one that matches is used.</p>
      
      <a name="pane_include" id="pane_include"></a>

      <h4>Include/Exclude During Pane Creation</h4>Whether a pane
      (or part of a pane) is created can be made conditional on the
      decoder type using "include" and "exclude" attributes on
      &lt;pane&gt; and &lt;group&gt; elements.

      <p>A pane will not be created:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If an exclude attribute is present, neither the
        decoders product ID, model name, nor family name is found
        in the exclude list.</li>

        <li>If an include attribute is present, at least one of the
        decoders product ID, model name, nor family name is found
        in the include list.</li>
      </ul>Both of these conditions must be true, and it's possible
      to use both include and exclude on the same element, but it's
      more usual to just use one.

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
      &lt;pane label="My Pane" include="ModelA,400"&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/pane&gt;
</pre>

      <p>"My Pane" will be created only when expanding the decoder
      definition for ModelA or product ID 400.</p>

      <p>You can also create a &lt;group&gt; element with include
      and exclude attributes. Elements within the &lt;group&gt;
      will be created only if the &lt;group&gt; conditions are met.
      This can be used to e.g. display specific text labels only
      for certain decoder models.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
      &lt;group include="ModelA,400"&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
          &lt;text&gt;These decoders are very old.&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
          &lt;text&gt;Some features are unavailable.&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;/group&gt;
</pre>

      <p>The text will be created only when expanding the decoder
      definition for ModelA or product ID 400.</p>

      <a name="prodidwarn" id="prodidwarn"></a>
      <h4>Warning Regarding Use of Product ID in Include/Exclude</h4>
      Care must be exercised when attempting to match against product ID in include or
      exclude attributes. The product ID is not matched against any value read from the
      decoder during
      <a href="#id">identification</a>
      but against the productID attribute specified in the decoder definition.
      This can particularly be a problem if the productID attribute has multiple values.
        For example:
        <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  &lt;decoder&gt;
    &lt;family name="My Big Family" mfg="NMRA"&gt;
      &lt;model model="My Model" productID="400,401" /&gt;
      &lt;/model&gt;
    &lt;/family&gt;
    &#8230;
  &lt;/decoder&gt;
  &lt;pane label="My 400 Pane" include="400"&gt;
    &#8230;
  &lt;/pane&gt;
  &lt;pane label="My 401 Pane" include="401"&gt;
    &#8230;
  &lt;/pane&gt;</pre>

      Both panes will always be created.
      If the definitions need to differ between product IDs, you will need to create two
      models, as per
      <a href="#id">the first example under Identification</a>.

      <a name="qualify" id="qualify"></a>
      <h4>Run-time Qualification of Variables</h4>

      <h5>Qualifying Variables</h5>A "qualifier" element on a
      variable element allows you to enable or disable the variable
      depending on the current value of another variable. This can
      be useful if, for example, the decoder has a "mode" CV that
      determines the meaning of other CVs.

      <p>If a variable is qualified as inactive, it doesn't appear
      in any panes and is neither read nor written to the decoder
      when you do "All" or "Changes only" read or write operations.
      The value is saved to the roster and will be reloaded when
      the roster entry is reopened later.</p>

      <p>In the following example, a CV is interpreted as two
      different variables depending on whether the decoder is set
      for short or long addressing.</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  &lt;variable label="Variable for Short Address" CV="11"&gt;
    &lt;qualifier&gt;
      &lt;variableref&gt;Address Format&lt;/variableref&gt;
      &lt;relation&gt;eq&lt;/relation&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;0&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/qualifier&gt;
    &lt;decVal/&gt;
  &lt;/variable&gt;
  &lt;variable label="Variable for Long Address" CV="11"&gt;
    &lt;qualifier&gt;
      &lt;variableref&gt;Address Format&lt;/variableref&gt;
      &lt;relation&gt;eq&lt;/relation&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;1&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/qualifier&gt;
    &lt;decVal/&gt;
  &lt;/variable&gt;
</pre>Other available operators include "gt", "ge", "ne", "lt",
"le" and "exists". The "exists" operator checks for whether a
variable is defined or not; a "1" value means that it is, and a "0"
means that it doesn't.

      <p>If multiple qualifier elements are present, all must be
      true for the variable to be active and displayed.</p><a name=
      "panes" id="panes"></a>

      <h5>Qualifying Panes</h5>A "qualifier" element on a pane
      element allows you to enable or disable the pane depending on
      the current value of a variable.

      <p>If a pane is qualified as inactive, its contents are no
      longer shown. This includes any labels or other decorations
      on the pane, in addition to the variables it contains.
      Depending on other options, the pane may either show as
      empty, or not show at all. The variables within it are still
      active, though, and a "Read all sheets" or "Write all sheets"
      will still write them. If you have overlapping variable
      definitions, consider carefully whether this is what you
      want. You might need to qualify the individual overlapping
      variables.</p>

      <p>The following example enables one of two panes depending
      on whether the decoder is currently set for short or long
      addressing.</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  &lt;pane name="Short Only"&gt;
    &lt;qualifier&gt;
      &lt;variableref&gt;Address Format&lt;/variableref&gt;
      &lt;relation&gt;eq&lt;/relation&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;0&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/qualifier&gt;
    &lt;column&gt;&lt;row&gt;
      &lt;label label="Short Only Pane"/&gt;
    &lt;/row&gt;&lt;/column&gt;
  &lt;/pane&gt;
  &lt;pane name="Long Only"&gt;
    &lt;qualifier&gt;
      &lt;variableref&gt;Address Format&lt;/variableref&gt;
      &lt;relation&gt;eq&lt;/relation&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;1&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/qualifier&gt;
    &lt;column&gt;&lt;row&gt;
      &lt;label label="Long Only Pane"/&gt;
    &lt;/row&gt;&lt;/column&gt;
  &lt;/pane&gt;
</pre>Other available operators include "gt", "ge", "ne", "lt" and
"le".

      <p>If multiple qualifier elements are present, all must be
      true for the pane to be active and displayed. <a name=
      "labels" id="labels"></a></p>

      <h5>Qualifying Elements on Panes</h5>A "qualifier" element on
      a "label", "soundlabel", "row", "column", "grid" or
      "griditem" element allows you to enable or disable the
      display of that element on a specific pane.

      <p>The following example displays a warning label if a
      version-number variable has a too-low value:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    &lt;label label="Version number too low!"&gt;
      &lt;qualifier&gt;
        &lt;variableref&gt;Version Number&lt;/variableref&gt;
        &lt;relation&gt;lt&lt;/relation&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;3&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/qualifier&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
</pre>

      <p>You can use the same qualifier for multiple elements by
      enclosing the elements in a "group" element and adding the
      qualifier to the "group" element:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    &lt;group&gt;
      &lt;qualifier&gt;
        &lt;variableref&gt;Version Number&lt;/variableref&gt;
        &lt;relation&gt;lt&lt;/relation&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;3&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/qualifier&gt;
      &lt;label label="Version number too low!"/&gt;
      &lt;label label=" "/&gt;
      &lt;label label="Please update."/&gt;
    &lt;/group&gt;
</pre>

      <p>Once you've read the Version Number (variable or CV) from
      the decoder, the label(s) will display iff that version
      number is too low. Note that initially, before the values are
      read from the decoder, this display will depend on the
      default value from the file, which might be misleading to the
      user.</p><!--#include virtual="/Footer" -->
