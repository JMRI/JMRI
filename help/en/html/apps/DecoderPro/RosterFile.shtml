      <h2>Roster File Details</h2>

      <p>The Roster information presented in the selection box, and used for automatic selection of
      a Locomotive, is stored in a number of individual files. You can find their location by
      choosing "Locations" from the main JMRI Help menu. Click the "Open Roster Location" button to
      open the directory in Finder/Explorer. More information is available on the <a href=
      "Files.shtml#location">"Configuration Files" Help page</a>. You should only use the Roster
      menu to manipulate the Roster file, to ensure that it stays self-consistent.</p>

      <p>To move the entire Roster to another computer, choose "Export Complete Roster" from the
      File menu, select a location to save the file, move that file to the other computer, then
      choose "Import Complete Roster" from the menu to import it there.</p>

      <p>To do this manually at the file level, there will be a file called "roster.xml", and a
      directory called "roster". You need to move the "roster.xml" file, the "roster" directory,
      and all it's contents. Read more about the <a href="../../setup/Files.shtml">JMRI
      Configuration Files</a>.</p>
