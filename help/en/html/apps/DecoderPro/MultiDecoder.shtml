      <h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>

      <h2>Multi-Decoder Tool</h2>Digitrax invented a <a href=
      "#digitraxproposal">mechanism</a> for having more than one
      decoder in locomotive, and still be able to read and write
      them separately. It uses CV15 and CV16 in a particular way to
      do this.

      <p>CV16 is the ID of a particular decoder; if you have more
      than one decoder in a locomotive, they should have different
      values in CV16.</p>

      <p>CV15 is used to unlock one decoder (and lock the others),
      so it can be written.</p>

      <p>Only decoders that have the value in CV15 equal to the
      value in CV16 will respond to reads and writes. Since you're
      supposed to originally set up the two decoders with different
      CV16 values, this means you can use CV15 to select which
      decoder you want to talk to.</p>

      <h2>DecoderPro's Handling of CV15 and CV16</h2>Really, the
      DecoderPro "paned programmer" shouldn't handle CV15 and CV16
      at all. They're not really "configuration data", in the sense
      that you can freely adjust them and see what they do. Rather,
      CV16 is a "set once before assembling the locomotive", and
      CV15 is an operational command "which decoder can talk now".

      <p>If a DecoderPro user did a write-all-sheets and changed
      either of those, future programming operations would be
      problematic.</p>

      <p>Hence, people writing decoder definitions are strongly
      encouraged not to include CV15 and CV16 (when they are used
      for decoder lock) in their definitions, or to include them
      only as "constant" CVs so the program will not write them.
      The user can then program those CVs using the "Single CV
      Programmer".</p>

      <h2>The Multi-Decoder Tool</h2><a href=
      "images/MultiControl.gif"><img src="images/MultiControl.gif"
      width="121" height="283" align="right"></a> When this feature
      was first coming into use, a "Multi-Decoder Tool" was written
      for JMRI (see image to right).

      <p>It has several parts.</p>

      <p>At the top are 8 buttons that you can click to unlock a
      particular decoder in the locomotive. E.g. if you click "3",
      the decoder configured with "3" in CV16 will be unlocked. If
      possible, the program tries to verify that the decoder is
      present and communicating; the status is shown in the middle
      of the window ("OK" in the illustration).</p>

      <p>If you click the "legacy" button, all decoders with the
      lock feature will be locked out. This is so you can write to
      an additional decoder without the lock feature. E.g. if you
      have one decoder with (say "2"), and one without the lock
      feature, you can still configure them by:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Click "2" - both decoders are now active.</li>

        <li>Write the information for "2", which will go to
        both.</li>

        <li>Click "Legacy", locking out "2".</li>

        <li>Write the information for the non-locking decoder,
        overwriting what you put in it above</li>
      </ol>Yes, that's ugly, but it can be made to work.

      <p>In the center are some buttons for automated operations
      you might find useful:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Search" - walks through a <u>long</u> series of writes
        and reads to determine which decoders are present. Buttons
        for decoders that aren't present will be disabled (grayed
        out).</li>

        <li>"Reset" - sometimes a decoder, even if installed by
        itself in the locomotive, can get accidentally locked when
        CV15 and/or CV16 is set to some spurious value. This button
        does a bunch of reads and writes to figure out what's
        happened and unlock the decoder.</li>

        <li>"Init DH163 + SoundTraxx" - If you have a DH163 or
        similar decoder with the lock feature, plus another decoder
        without the feature, this button works through a series of
        operations to configure the Digitrax lock feature so you
        can use it. (Normally you'd take the locomotive apart so as
        to be able to load the Digitrax CV16 value).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, the bottom part of the page allows you to
      control the programming mode in use.</p>

      <p>Although it's possible to use this tool in "Ops mode"
      (programming on the main), in that case it's not able to
      confirm operations, so one can't be 100% sure that the right
      decoder is selected.</p>

      <a name="digitraxproposal" id="digitraxproposal"></a>
      <h2>Digitrax's Original Proposal</h2>
      <p>DCC users sometimes want
      to install more than one decoder in a single locomotive. One
      common case is using separate decoders for motor control and
      sound. Because these decoders often need to have their CVs
      configured separately, a mechanism is needed to communicate
      with only one at a time.</p>

      <p>This mechanism must be able to:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Do service-mode read and write from a specific decoder,
        with no need to disconnect other decoders
        electrically.</li>

        <li>Discover the type of decoder(s) present inside a
        locomotive, without disassembly, and despite multiple
        decoders being present.</li>

        <li>Work with existing DCC systems without
        modification</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Proposal:</h3>CV16 will carry a number from 0 to 7
      inclusive. This is called the "ID number". This number
      identifies a single decoder, so a unique value must be
      assigned to each decoder in a particular locomotive. Because
      most users will use this mechanism with decoders that provide
      different functions, the recommended coding is:
      <pre>
  0: Reset value, as shipped
  
  1: Motor decoder
  
  2: Sound decoder
  
  3: Function-only decoder (e.g. for additional lights)
</pre>CV15 is used to select the decoder that will respond. When
the values in CV15 and CV16 are equal, all CVs in the decoder can
be read or written. When the values in CV15 and CV16 are not equal,
only CV15 can be written.

      <p>Some manufacturers may want to provide a bit in a CV to
      enable/disable this feature. If so, that should be in a CV
      reserved for the manufacturers use, as no NMRA CV has been
      reserved for this purpose.</p>

      <p>Note that a command to reset the decoder to default CV
      values must not be acted upon unless the CV15 and CV16 values
      are equal. This prevents the user from accidentally resetting
      multiple decoders at the same time, and losing the ability to
      separately address them.</p>

      <p>To configure decoders at installation:</p>

      <p>Before installing each decoder in the locomotive:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Connect it to the programming track all by itself</li>

        <li>Write 8 to CV8 to ensure CV15 and CV16 are both
        zero</li>

        <li>If desired, read CV15 to confirm that the decoder can
        be addressed (This is a read of 0, hence fast)</li>

        <li>Write CV16 to the desired ID number, e.g. 2</li>

        <li>Write CV15 to the ID number</li>

        <li>Configure the rest of the decoder</li>

        <li>Disconnect it and install it in the locomotive</li>
      </ol>Repeat in turn for each decoder to be installed

      <p>Note that if the user is installing only one decoder,
      there is no need to modify the default values of zero in CV15
      and CV16.</p>

      <p>To access a decoder after installation:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Write the ID of the desired decoder into CV15</li>

        <li>Read or write other CVs as needed</li>
      </ol>To identify the decoder(s) present in a locomotive:

      <ol>
        <li>Write a 0 to CV15</li>

        <li>Attempt to read a 0 from CV16.</li>

        <li>If no acknowledge is received, there is no decoder with
        ID 0. If an acknowledge is received, a decoder with ID 0
        exists.</li>
      </ol>Repeat this process for ID 1 through 7 to check for
      those.

      <p>Because the ID values are low, a successful read is quite
      fast. An unsuccessful read, i.e. when the decoder is not
      present, will take some time on many existing command
      stations, but eventually give an answer. This can be made
      faster in the future by having command stations attempt to
      read just the expected value, instead of 0 to 255, in the
      absense of an acknowledge.</p>
