      <h2>How DecoderPro Identifies Decoders</h2>

      <p>To properly program a decoder, DecoderPro needs to be able
      to find a "definition" for the decoder. That definition
      specifies which CVs are understood by the decoder, what they
      mean, what values are valid, etc.</p>

      <p>DecoderPro allows a user to pick which decoder model they
      have installed, in which case it can automatically find the
      right definition. But it also provide an "Ident" function
      which attempts to locate the right definition based on
      information it reads from the decoder.</p>

      <p>Ident starts by reading the manufacturer code from CV8.
      The NMRA has defined a set of unique values for this CV.
      Since (almost) all decoders properly provide this
      information, DecoderPro can use it to narrow-down the list of
      possible definitions to just those from a particular
      manufacter.</p>

      <p>Next, DecoderPro reads the value from CV7. The NMRA has
      defined this as the "version" number. Unfortunately, not all
      manufacturers use this number in a way that provides
      necessary information. There are two ways that this can go
      wrong:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Too many decoders with the same version number:

          <p>If many different types of decoders have the same
          version number, and if those versions differ enough, then
          the version number doesn't provide enough information to
          pick a specific definition.</p>

          <p>For example, if version number 3 can be found in both
          a low-cost decoder with few CVs, and in a high-function
          decoder with lots of CVs, finding a 3 in CV7 doesn't
          provide enough information.</p>

          <p>This problem happens most often when a particular
          model can have a range of version numbers in CV7, and
          those ranges overlap from one model to another.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Not enough information available about what a version
        number means:

          <p>This is particularly a problem when the version number
          changes because new features have been added, but the
          model number of the decoder stays the same. For example,
          consider the confusion that's caused when a manufacturer
          adds BEMF to their XYZ123 without calling it a new model.
          Now we find that some XYZ123 decoders have BEMF, and some
          don't. Further, we find that there are two version
          numbers: 23 and 51, and have no official information on
          what the differences are. It's very hard to sort that
          out, and customers get very frustrated.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>In addition to using the version number in CV7, DecoderPro
      can look at values in other, manufacturer-specific CVs to
      identify the decoder. This can be very powerful, as
      manufacturers can use their own CVs to make as much
      information available as desired.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, even those manufacturers who use additional
      CVs for identification information rarely make the meaning of
      values in those CVs publicly available. We then have to
      deduce what a 103 in a particular CV means, and we often get
      it wrong.</p>

      <p>It's important to note that there are good business
      reasons for some of the things that manufacturers have done
      with identification information so far. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Manufacturers often use the same processor chip and
        software in multiple decoder models; it would be
        cost-prohibitive to change the chip to have a unique
        identification code for each specific model.

          <p>But we don't need a unique tag for each model. We only
          need to identify what CVs are present and what they mean;
          two decoders that are running the same software will have
          the same CVs present. (We handle as a special case the
          number of outputs that are physically available, etc)</p>
        </li>

        <li>Manufacturers are concerned that users and dealers will
        use the version identification information to identify
        "stale stock", and insist on free updates to the most
        recent version. This would be a huge economic burden to the
        manufacturer, particularly given that most requests might
        be motivated by a desire to for a "latest and greatest"
        rather than the need for specific bug to be fixed.

          <p>It's important to note, however, that we don't need to
          be able to identify the specific version of firmware per
          se; we only want to identify the CV programming needed.
          Internal changes need not effect the identification
          information.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>What should a responsible
      manufacturer do?

      <p>Generally:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Have a plan for how to identify the feature set and CVs
        of a decoder, and disclose that plan to users. It might be
        something like "you can look in CV7 and CV150 to identify
        the features of a decoder". To deal with the history of
        past decoders, etc, it might have to be more complicated:
        "Match the values in CV7, CV150 and CV 188 to the possible
        values on this web page". We'll find a way to deal with
        anything that can be described in terms of CV values.</li>

        <li>As new types of decoders are produced, make sure to
        publish the specific information needed to identify the
        decoder. This might be as simple as putting the
        identification values on a web page for the decoder. (Since
        the values might change, putting them in an manual is of
        limited use)</li>
      </ul>Beyond that:

      <ul>
        <li>The most value for the customer would come if a
        <em>specific</em> model can be identified. An additional CV
        for this would be ideal, but any method of narrowing down
        to a model 2XYZ123AB decoder would be ideal.</li>

        <li>If concerned about separating "firmware update version"
        from "feature set", consider using separate CVs for that,
        and perhaps not even making the "firmware update"
        information available to users.</li>

        <li>An easy way to handle older decoders when moving to a
        new method is to identify a specific CV7 value that hasn't
        been used, and define that as a flag that other CVs should
        be consulted for more information.</li>

        <li>When new features are added to a decoder, consider
        calling it a new model. Having many different versions of
        the XYZ123 decoder, some with BEMF, some without, some with
        special lighting options, some without, etc, confuses both
        the customer and the people trying to support customers
        with software like DecoderPro. And why not get credit for
        the new features from people who'll ask for the new
        model?</li>
