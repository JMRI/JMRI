      <h2>The Details</h2>

      <p>This page provides information on how DecoderPro (Symbolic
      Programmer) works.<br>
      For details on the JMRI internals, please see the <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/IntroStructure.shtml">Technical Doc
      pages</a>.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt class="left">Configuration Files</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          <p>There are three types of <a href=
          "Files.shtml">Configuration Files</a>:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Decoder configuration files - These carry the
            description of a specific type of decoder, and control
            how the programmer displays the variable
            information.</li>

            <li>Locomotive configuration files - These carry the
            specific information on a single locomotive.</li>

            <li>Programmer definitions - These define the formats
            for the various programming sheets.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The programmer can read either type of file. If you
          select a decoder file after clicking Read File, the
          programmer will be set up with the variables, options,
          etc for that type. The values will be blank, as the
          programmer doesn't know anything about what's been
          programmed into a specific decoder unit.</p>

          <p>If you select a locomotive file after clicking Read
          File, information on both the decoder configuration and
          the specific settings in this locomotive will be
          displayed. This shows you how the locomotive is already
          configured, allowing you to make small changes with less
          chance of confusion.</p>

          <p>You can also write locomotive files with the Write
          File button. This will store the known contents of the
          decoder, allowing you to come back to it later.</p>

          <p>The configuration files are stored in XML format. This
          is a standard form for structured data. XML is being
          widely used to standardize the exchange of data between
          different manufacturers in many fields; perhaps someday
          DCC decoder manufacturers will provide an XML description
          of each decoder they make. In the meantime, the
          configuration files are being created by volunteers. If
          one doesn't exist for a specific decoder you've got, you
          can <a href="CreateDecoder.shtml">create your own</a>.
          You can also modify a file if you'd prefer different
          names, a different grouping of options, or you just never
          want to see that certain options that you don't use. A
          simple text editor can create these files easily, as the
          format doesn't have fixed length fields, special
          characters, etc. There are also powerful public-domain
          XML tools that make it really easy to manage a large
          number of decoder files.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Variables</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A "variable" defines the value that will be loaded
          into all or part of a CV. For example, a variable can be
          defined that sets the value of the three most-significant
          bits of CV 47. If there are several options configured in
          a single CV, these would normally be handled by separate
          variables. Currently, there are several types of
          variables:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Decimal - numbers entered in the usual decimal
            notation. These are useful for short address, starting
            voltages, etc.</li>

            <li>Enum (enumerated) - choose from a set of options.
            These can be used for simple on/off, yes/no choices, or
            more complicated sets like the FX lighting example
            above. The configuration contains a name for each
            possibility.</li>

            <li>Long address - like a decimal value, except the
            constraints on a valid long address are taken into
            account.</li>

            <li>Hex - This is not so much needed, since the
            multiple options in a single CV can be handled by
            multiple variables. But if its needed for some reason,
            the capability is present.</li>

            <li>Speed table - not yet really working well, this
            type of variable is intended to provide a graphic speed
            table chart that you can drag around to configure as
            you wish.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Programmer communication: States</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Communication with the Command Station/programmer,
          hence reading and writing of the decoder, are only done
          when the "Read" or "Write" buttons are pressed.
          DecoderPro keeps track of whether a value has been sent
          to the decoder using four States for variables or
          CVs:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Read - The value shown was read from the
            decoder.</li>

            <li>Stored - The value shown has been written to the
            decoder.</li>

            <li>Edited - The value shown has been changed in the
            computer, but not yet written to the decoder. Push the
            Write button when you're happy with the value.</li>

            <li>Unknown - A default value, or a read has failed, or
            for some other reason the program has no confidence
            that the value is what you really want. Edit the value
            or press the Write button.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Printing</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>You can print the current locomotive's information
          from the programmer windows. From the "File..." menu,
          select "Print...", and fill out the dialog box that's
          presented.</p>

          <p>The printout is formatted by the currently-selected
          programmer format, so the information on all of the tabs
          is printed. You get a shorter printout of just the most
          important values when you print from the "Basic" format,
          and a listing of everything when you use
          "Comprehensive".</p>
