      <h2>Create a Custom Programmer</h2>

      <p>How do I create my own custom programmer?</p>

      <p>The answer starts with the creation of an xml file in the
      "programmers" subdirectory of the JMRI distribution. The
      contents of the file are described here.</p>

      <p>After some initial parts (which you can just copy from an
      existing file), the rest of the file is a series of "pane"
      definition elements. Each one become a pane in the DecoderPro
      window.</p>

      <p>The panes in the programmer file appear when you select
      that programmer in DecoderPro. Note that panes can also be
      defined in the decoder definition, in which case those panes
      appear after the ones in the programmer definitions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>There is an option to present/hide panes from the
        decoder file. If you're writing a very basic programmer,
        you might want to hide them to keep the interface
        simple.</li>

        <li>If a pane is defined in the decoder file and programmer
        file with the same name, the one from the decoder file (the
        more specific one) appears.</li>
      </ul>

      <dl>
        <dt class="left">Specifying items to display</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          <p>The basic element of a programmer pane is a "display".
          This tells the programmer to present a single variable.
          The attributes are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><dfn>name</dfn> - (Required) This is the "standard
            name" of the variable to be presented.</li>

            <li><dfn>label</dfn> - If present, this will be used to
            label the variable on the pane instead of the name or
            standard name of the variable.</li>

            <li><dfn>layout</dfn> - Where to locate the label with
            respect to the editable field, e.g. the text box.
            Possible values are "left", "above", "below", "right"
            with a default of "right".</li>

            <li>
              <dfn>format</dfn> -

              <p>How the variable should be presented. Numeric
              variables can be presented as</p>

              <ul>
                <li>an editable text field, which is the default if
                nothing is specified</li>

                <li><dfn>hslider</dfn> - a horizontal slider</li>

                <li><dfn>vslider</dfn> - a vertical slider</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Enum variables can be presented as</p>

              <ul>
                <li>a selection box, which is the default if
                nothing is specified</li>

                <li><dfn>radiobuttons</dfn> - Each possible value
                is presented as an individual button</li>

                <li><dfn>checkbox</dfn> - An enum with only two
                states can also be presented as a checkbox</li>

                <li><dfn>offradiobutton</dfn> - A single button
                that sets the 0 choice for the variable when
                selected</li>

                <li><dfn>onradiobutton</dfn> - A single button that
                sets the 1 choice for the variable when
                selected</li>
              </ul>

              <p>These last two can be useful for indicating which
              parts of a configuration are active; see the "Speed
              Table" pane of Comprehensive.xml for an example.</p>
            </li>

            <li><dfn>tooltip</dfn> - Allows you to specify a default
            tooltip to be presented when the cursor is left over
            the variable. This tooltip will be overridden by any
             tooltip defined in the decoder file.
             (Note: This behaviour differs from
             <a href="#display">the behaviour of the label attribute</a>.)</li>
          </ul><a name="display" id="display"></a>

          <p>Which name to display is controlled by the pane's
          'nameFmt' attribute, and the 'label' attribute on each
          display element (variable).</p>

          <p>The choices are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If a label is specified, it will be used. Use a
            label if you want absolute control over what a variable
            should be called, regardless of what the decoder file
            calls it, and you don't like the standard name.</li>

            <li>The pane's nameFmt attribute is "item", in which
            case the item name will be used regardless of what the
            decoder file calls the variable. Use this is you want a
            uniform appearance for the pane for all decoders. But
            be aware that some standard names are really so generic
            as to be useless.</li>

            <li>If the pane's nameFmt attribute is allowed to
            default, or contains "mfg", the decoder definition
            file's name will be used. This is the normal form, as
            it allows a manufacturer to specify in some detail what
            a variable defines.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Formatting</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Each pane of the programmer consists of (nested) rows
          and/or columns. Columns lay out variables from top to
          bottom. Rows lay out variables from left to right. You
          can nest these to achieve various effects; for an example
          of this, see the "Speed Table" pane of the
          Comprehensive.xml file. It has two columns, the left of
          each uses a row to put some sliders from left to
          right.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Special Elements</dt>

        <dd>
          There are a number of elements you can use to get the
          programmer formatted exactly the way you want:

          <ul>
            <li><dfn>grid</dfn> - Create a grid for laying out
            elements in aligned rows and columns. See the <a href=
            "#grid">Grid Layout</a> section below.</li>

            <li><dfn>label</dfn> - Add text to a pane.</li>

            <li><dfn>soundlabel</dfn> - Add a soundlabel (from the
            decoder definition file) to a pane. It has a one
            attribute:</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <ul>
                <li><dfn>num</dfn> - (Required) This is the number
                of the sound label to be presented.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><dfn>separator</dfn> - Add a separator line to a
            pane. If included in a column, this will be a
            horizontal separator line. If included in a row, it
            will be a vertical line.</li>

            <li><dfn>cvtable</dfn> - Insert a table of CV values
            onto the pane. To get the spacing right you should
            probably not combine this with other variables on the
            same pane.</li>

            <li><dfn>fnmapping</dfn> - Show a function mapping
            grid. This requires variables with specific names,
            which are described on a <a href=
            "FnMapping.shtml">separate page</a>.</li>

            <li><dfn>dccaddress</dfn> - Show a combined variable
            for the DCC address. This consists of a checkbox that
            selects use of short vs long address, and a single text
            field for entering the address. Depending on how the
            checkbox is set, the text field will configure the CV1
            short address or the CV17/18 long address.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dd><a id="grid" name="grid"></a></dd>

        <dt class="left"><a id="grid" name="grid">Formatting with
        the Grid Layout</a></dt>

        <dd>
          <a id="grid" name="grid"></a>

          <p>The "row" and "column" elements allow you to align
          elements in rows or columns, but if you have multiple
          columns within a row element (or vice versa) it is not
          possible to ensure that rows in adjacent columns (or vice
          versa) stay aligned.</p>

          <p>The Grid Layout allows you to align elements in rows
          and columns, maintaining alignment even if a particular
          element is absent. There are two elements:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><dfn>grid</dfn> - Create a grid layout (within a
            "row" or "column" element):</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <ul>
                <li>It may have one or more optional
                attributes.</li>

                <li>The only allowed sub-element is "griditem" and
                there must be at least one of these.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><dfn>griditem</dfn> - Create a grid item (within a
            "grid" element):</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <ul>
                <li>It should have "gridx" and "gridy"
                attributes.</li>

                <li>It may also have one or more optional
                attributes.</li>

                <li>It must contain one or more elements, which can
                be any combination of any of the other elements
                listed above, including "row", "column", or even
                another "grid".</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The "gridx" and "gridy" attributes of a grid item
          specify the location of that item within the grid. A
          value of gridx="0" puts the item in the lefmost column. A
          value of gridy="0" puts the item in the topmost row.
          Other attributes to control the format of the grid items
          are available and are documented in the <a href=
          "http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html"
          target="_blank">Java&reg; GridBagLayout Tutorial</a>.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Attributes of "grid" apply to all items in the
            table.</li>

            <li>Attributes of "griditem" apply to only that item
            and override any equivalent attribute of "grid".</li>

            <li>Both numeric and named constant values (as
            specified by the <a href=
            "http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html"
            target="_blank">documentation</a>) can be used.</li>

            <li>Two extra named constant values are available for
            "gridx" and "gridy":</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <ul>
                <li>"CURRENT" is the value from the last added
                "griditem" (i.e. the same row or column).</li>

                <li>"NEXT" is one more than the value from the last
                added "griditem" (i.e. the next row or column).<br>
                  ("NEXT" is actually a synonym for
                "RELATIVE".)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>The "insets" attribute is specified as
            insets="top,left,bottom,right" where "top" etc. are
            integers.</li>

            <li>A "griditem" can span more than one grid cell.
            Attributes "gridwidth" and "gridheight" control
            this.</li>

            <li>By default grid items clump together in the centre
            of a container. Attribute "weightx" can override this
            and left/right justify.</li>

            <li>It is possible in some circumstances to omit either
            or both of "gridx" and "gridy" from a "griditem" and
            specify a default value in "grid". See <a href=
            "http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/jmri/xml/decoders/esu/v4fnOutPane.xml"
            target="_blank">xml/decoders/esu/v4fnOutPane.xml</a>
            for an example of this usage to generate a simple
            single-column right-aligned grid. (However if you are
            not careful with use of this technique and/or the
            "RELATIVE" constant, results can be bizarre.)</li>

            <li>Unfortunately "ipadx", "ipady" and "insets"
            allocate space even if the enclosed display variable(s)
            fail qualification. A workaround is to qualify the
            whole "griditem" enclosing the variable (if that is
            appropriate to the situation).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For an example of Grid Layout use (with some
          explanations of attributes used), see <a href=
          "http://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/jmri/xml/decoders/esu/v4soundPane.xml"
          target="_blank">xml/decoders/esu/v4soundPane.xml</a>. The
          LokSound Select (and V4) definitions use this file.</p>

          <p>All of the .xml files in the "programmers"
          subdirectory will appear in the selection box when you
          create a new programmer in Decoder Pro. To use your new
          file, just put it in the "programmers" subdirectory of
          the "prefs" directory and select it. You don't have to
          restart the program, as the list is remade each time you
          open a new programmer window.</p>

      </dl><a name="id" id="id"></a>

      <h3>How variables in a decoder file match up with the
      programmer file</h3>Each decoder file defines <a href=
      "CreateDecoder.shtml#variable">variables</a> that describe
      specific controls within the decoder. The programmer file
      then describes how to place those on panes so that the user
      can find and manipulate them.

      <p>Each "display" element in the programmer file defines one
      thing to show. But which one? That's controlled by the "name"
      attribute of the "display" element. DecoderPro takes that
      "name" and looks through the decoder definition for a
      "variable" element that has either the same "item" or "label"
      attribute.</p>

      <p>This has some nice effects:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The "name" in the "display" element is effectively a
        "standard name", that can be used in decoder definition
        files from many different manufacturers. Since this is
        separate from the "label" on the decoder variable, it's
        possible to have a generic programmer file that works for
        many types of different decoders, while still displaying
        specific variable names. For more on this, please <a href=
        "#display">see above</a>.</li>

        <li>It lets you use very generic names to control where
        somewhat different things go. For example, different sound
        decoders provide different controls. One might have
        "Airpump", while another doesn't have that at all, and
        instead has "Brake Squeal". We don't want to have the
        programmer files contain zillions of "display" elements to
        handle every possible option. Instead, we use elements with
        more generic names, like "Sound Option 1", for the display
        name.

          <p>The decoder definition then has a "label" of "Airpump"
          or whatever, and an "item" of "Sound Option 1".
          Everything matches up properly, and "Airpump" appears on
          the computer's screen.</p>
        </li>
