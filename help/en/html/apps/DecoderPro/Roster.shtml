      <h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>

      <h2>Rosters</h2><a href="images/DP4StartScreen.png"><img src=
      "images/DP4StartScreen.png" width="376" height="278" align=
      "right"></a>

      <p>Reading the contents of a decoder generally takes a long
      time, and with some command stations it's not even possible.
      The JMRI Roster stores the known values of decoder
      configuration values to make it unnecessary to read them from
      the decoder. It can contain "Roster entries" for an unlimited
      number of individual locomotives.</p>

      <p>Each Roster entry has an "identifier" (Roster ID) by which
      it's known. This is your name it.
      When the program wants you to select a Roster
      entry, it will ask you to pick from a selection box or menu containing 
      Roster entry IDs. You can use anything you want for this:
      Road number, type, even "That crummy old model I need to
      repaint" or "My beautiful Shay".</p>

      <p>You can edit the contents of a Roster entry with the
      programmer panes.</p>

      <h3>Roster Entry</h3>

      <p>When you first open a JMRI programmer, you'll see a
      "Create New Loco" pane (pictured to the right).<br>
      On it is displayed:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Roster ID</dt>

        <dd>Your name for the new locomotive, see above.
        You can change an entry's ID later,
        in which case it will appear in new selection boxes, etc, with
        the new ID name.</dd>

        <dt>DCC Address</dt>

        <dd>This is either a Short or Long Address, based on how
        the decoder is configured.</dd>

        <dt>Buttons</dt>

        <dd>To <strong>Read</strong> the information from a decoder
        with this address, <strong>Write</strong> changes to that
        decoder or only <strong>Save</strong> this entry to
        disk.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Click the "Open Comprehensive Programmer" button at lower
      right to display a row of tabbed panes with additional
      properties:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Roster Entry</dt>

        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>Road Name</li>

            <li>Road Number</li>

            <li>Manufacturer</li>

            <li>Model</li>

            <li>Owner</li>

            <li>Comment<br>
            Use these fields for whatever you want.</li>

            <li>Decoder Family</li>

            <li>Decoder Model<br>
            These two fields are filled in based on the decoder
            that was selected when the entry was created. They
            can't be edited after that.</li>

            <li>Decoder Comment<br>
            You can put anything you want here. Some people have
            used it to record whether an NMRA plug was used,
            whether the decoder was soldered in, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Basic</dt>

        <dd>With additional information about your Locomotive
        etc.</dd>

        <dt>Motor, Basic Speed Control, and many other tabs:</dt>

        <dd><a href="images/DP4ComprehensiveTabs.png"><img src=
        "images/DP4ComprehensiveTabs.png" alt="DP pane tabs" width=

      <h3>The Roster Menu</h3><img src="images/DPRosterMenu.png"
      width="207" height="313" align="right"> The JMRI application
      main windows and the DecoderPro windows have a "Roster" menu
      available. That menu allows you to manage the entries in your
      Roster with commands:

      <dl>
        <dd><a id="create" name="create"></a></dd>

        <dt>Create Entry ...</dt>

        <dd>"Create" is used to create a new Roster entry, even if
        you don't currently have a connection to a layout. When you
        select this, you're given a window in which to select a
        decoder type. Pick the right decoder type, the format you
        want, and click "Open". You'll see a DecoderPro-style
        window for changing the contents of the new entry. Don't
        forget to click "Save" when you're done! <a id="edit" name=
        "edit"></a></dd>

        <dt>Edit Entry ...</dt>

        <dd>"Edit" is used to update the contents of a Roster
        entry, even when you don't have a layout connection
        (normally, if you do have a layout connection, you'll use
        the DecoderPro programming functions). When you select
        this, you'll get a window in which to select an existing
        Roster entry, a format, and an "Open" button. Once you
        click "Open", you'll get a DecoderPro-style window for
        viewing and changing the contents of the entry. Don't
        forget to click "Save" when you're done! <a id="copy" name=
        "copy"></a></dd>

        <dt>Copy Entry ...</dt>

        <dd>"Copy" is used to create another Roster entry that's
        identical to the original except for it's ID. If you have a
        standard setup you'd like to use for new locomotives, you
        can create a Roster entry with all the right values filled
        in, and then copy it every time you want to program a new
        locomotive. <a id="export" name="export"></a></dd>

        <dt>Export Entry ...</dt>

        <dd>
          Although it is possible to find the XML files defining
          Roster entries in the preferences directory, it's better
          not to mess with them directly. The "Export" command will
          create a new file representing a Roster entry, including
          all of the comments, CV values, etc. You can then take
          that to another copy of DecoderPro and import it into
          that Roster. Export does not change your current Roster
          in any way, it just makes a copy for you of a specific
          entry.

          <p>When you select "Export ...", you be asked to select
          the Roster entry you want to export, then you'll be
          prompted to select a new filename. You can call it
          anything you want, but it's best to put a ".xml"
          extension on the name. <a id="import" name=
          "import"></a></p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Import Entry ...</dt>

        <dd>
          The combination of "Export" then "Import" allows you to
          bring a locomotives Roster entry when you move to another
          layout, with it's own DecoderPro installation.

          <p>When you select "Import ...", you'll be asked to
          locate an XML file to import. It should have been created
          by an "Export" command. You'll also be asked for the ID
          of the new Roster entry to be created. This can be the
          same as it was before it was exported, or you can give it
          a new ID.</p><a id="delete" name="delete"></a>
        </dd>

        <dt>Delete Entry ...</dt>

        <dd>This completely removes a Roster entry. You're asked if
        you're sure and a backup is made, in case of mistakes.
        <a id="summary" name="summary"></a></dd>

        <dt>Print Summary ...</dt>

        <dd>
          This prints a summary of the entire Roster, listing the
          primary information for each entry.

          <p>For a more detailed listing of a specific decoder, see
          the "File" menu on the programmer screens. <a id=
          "previewsummary" name="previewsummary"></a></p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Print Preview Summary ...</dt>

        <dd>This shows the contents of the printed summary on your
        screen, so you can preview it before printing.</dd>
