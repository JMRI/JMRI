<h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>
<h2>Rosters</h2>

<a href="images/DP4StartScreen.png"><img src="images/DP4StartScreen.png" width="376" height="278" align="right"></a>
<p>Reading the contents of a decoder generally takes a long time, and with
some command stations it's not even possible. The JMRI Roster
stores the known values of decoder configuration values to make it
unnecessary to read them from the decoder.  It can contain "Roster entries"
for an unlimited number of individual locomotives.</p>

<p>
Each Roster entry has an "identifier" (Roster ID) by which it's known.
When the program wants you to select a Roster entry, it will show
a selection box or menu containing all of the Roster entry IDs.
You can use anything you want for this:  Road number, type, even
"That crummy old model I need to repaint" or "My beautiful Shay".</p>

<p>
You can edit the contents of a Roster entry with the programmer panes.</p>

<h3>Roster Entry</h3>

<p>When you first open a JMRI programmer, you'll see a "Create New Loco" pane (pictured to the right).<br>
On it is displayed:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Roster ID</dt>
	<dd>
	The ID for this entry.  You can change it if you want, in
	which case it will appear in selection boxes, etc, with the
	new ID name.</dd>
	<dt>DCC Address</dt>
	<dd>This is either a Short or Long Address, based on how the decoder is configured.</dd>
	<dt>Buttons</dt>
	<dd>To <strong>Read</strong> the information from a decoder with this address, <strong>Write</strong> changes to that decoder or only <strong>Save</strong> this entry to disk.</dd>
</dl>	

<p>Click the "Open Comprehensive Programmer" button at lower right to display a row of tabbed panes with additional properties:</p>
<dl>	
	<dt>Roster Entry</dt>
		<ul>
		<li>Road Name
		<li>Road Number
		<li>Manufacturer
		<li>Model
		<li>Owner
	  <li>Comment<br>
	  Use these fields for whatever you want.</li>
		<li>Decoder Family
		<li>Decoder Model<br>
		These two fields are filled in based on the decoder that was selected when
	  the entry was created. They can't be edited after that.</li>
		<li>Decoder Comment<br>
		You can put anything you want here.  Some people have
	  used it to record whether an NMRA plug was used, whether the
	  decoder was soldered in, etc.</li>
	  </ul>
	</dt>
	<dt>Basic<br>
	additional information about your Locomotive etc.</dt>
	<dt>Motor, Basic Speed Control, and many other tabs:<br>

<h3>The Roster Menu</h3>

<img src="images/DPRosterMenu.png" width="207" height="313" align="right">
The JMRI application main windows and the DecoderPro windows
have a "Roster" menu available.  That menu allows you to
manage the entries in your Roster with commands:

<dl>
	
	<a id="create">
	<dt>Create Entry ...
	<dd>
	"Create" is used to create a new Roster entry, even if you
	don't currently have a connection to a layout. 
	When you select this, you're given a window in which to select
	a decoder type. Pick the right decoder type, the format you want,
	and click "Open". You'll see a DecoderPro-style window for changing the contents
	of the new entry.
	Don't forget to click "Save" when you're done!
	
	<a id="edit">
	<dt>Edit Entry ...
	<dd>
	"Edit" is used to update the contents of a Roster entry, even when you
	don't have a layout connection (normally, if you do have a layout connection,
	you'll use the DecoderPro programming functions).  When you select this,
	you'll get a window in which to select an existing Roster entry, a 
	format, and an "Open" button. Once you click "Open", you'll get a 
	DecoderPro-style window for viewing and changing the contents of the entry.
	Don't forget to click "Save" when you're done!
	
	<a id="copy">
	<dt>Copy Entry ...
	<dd>
	"Copy" is used to create another Roster entry that's identical
	to the original except for it's ID.  If you have a standard setup
	you'd like to use for new locomotives, you can create a Roster entry
	with all the right values filled in, and then copy it every time you
	want to program a new locomotive.
	
	<a id="export">
	<dt>Export Entry ...
	<dd>
	Although it is possible to find the XML files defining Roster entries
	in the preferences directory, it's better not to mess with them directly.
	The "Export" command will create a new file representing a Roster entry,
	including all of the comments, CV values, etc.  You can then take that
	to another copy of DecoderPro and import it into that Roster.
	Export does not change your current Roster in any way, it
	just makes a copy for you of a specific entry.
	
	<p>
	When you select "Export ...", you be asked to select the
	Roster entry you want to export, then you'll be prompted to select
	a new filename.  You can call it anything you want, but
	it's best to put a ".xml" extension on the name.
	
	<a id="import">
	<dt>Import Entry ...
	<dd>
	The combination of "Export" then "Import" allows you to bring a locomotives
	Roster entry when you move to another layout, with it's own DecoderPro installation.
	
	<p>When you select "Import ...", you'll be asked to locate an XML file
	to import. It should have been created by an "Export" command.  You'll
	also be asked for the ID of the new Roster entry to be created.
	This can be the same as it was before it was exported, or you can
	give it a new ID.</p>
	
	<a id="delete">
	<dt>Delete Entry ...
	<dd>
	This completely removes a Roster entry.  You're asked if you're sure
	and a backup is made, in case of mistakes.
	
	<a id="summary">
	<dt>Print Summary ...
	<dd>
	This prints a summary of the entire Roster, listing the primary 
	information for each entry.
	<p>
	For a more detailed listing of a specific decoder, see the 
	"File" menu on the programmer screens.
	
	<a id="previewsummary">
	<dt>Print Preview Summary ...
	<dd>
	This shows the contents of the printed summary on your screen,
	so you can preview it before printing.
