      <h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>

      <p>The JMRI libraries contain the DecoderPro application for programming DCC decoders. This page
      introduces the current application and how you may use it.<br>
      It assumes you have <a href="Install.shtml">installed JMRI</a> and
      <a href="../../hardware/index.shtml">connected</a> your computer to your layout.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Modern DCC decoders are complicated beasts to program. The simple idea of "put the address
      in CV01" doesn't cope well when you program complicated functions using combinations of bit
      patterns. A friendlier interface is needed. There are programs that provide better ways of
      programming specific decoders. Unfortunately, they are limited to specific types of
      computers, and only their authors can customize them for new types of decoders.</p>

      <p>The DecoderPro symbolic programmer was developed to solve this. It supports a wide range of decoders and
      manufacturers via a consistent set of screens. As decoders became more advanced, DecoderPro had to give you
      acces to all those settings, but by clearly labelling them and grouping them into sets, and adding
      interactive tooltips the developers support you a long way. Behind the scenes, DecoderPro is
      configured using text files, so that it can be adapted to additional decoder types easily.<br>
      It talks to the decoders using the JMRI programming interface, so that it can run on any computer and layout hardware
      that JMRI has been ported to. It's freely available for download. And since the code is
      available via open source on <a href="../../doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">GitHub</a>, if
      you want to improve on it, you can.</p>

      <h2 id="decoderlisting">Decoder Information</h2>

      <p>The JMRI project has compiled a lot of information about decoders from many manufacturers,
      which we make freely available in several forms. To learn more, see the <a href=
