      <h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>

      <p>Current as for JMRI version 4.2</p>

      <h2>Introduction to the JMRI Symbolic Programmer</h2>

      <p>Modern DCC decoders are complicated beasts to program. The
      simple idea of "put the address in CV01" doesn't cope well
      when you program complicated functions using combinations of
      bit patterns. A friendlier interface is needed. There are
      programs that provide better ways of programming specific
      decoders. Unfortunately, they are limited to specific types
      of computers, and only their authors can customize them for
      new types of decoders.</p>

      <p>The DecoderPro symbolic programmer is meant to improve
      this. It is configured using text files, so that it can be
      adapted to additional decoder types easily. It talks to the
      decoders using the JMRI programming interface, so that it can
      run on any computer and layout hardware that JMRI has been
      ported to. It's freely available for download. And since the
      code is available via open source on <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">GitHub</a>, if you
      want to improve on it you can.</p>

      <p>The <a href="./Tour.shtml">Quick Tour</a> introduces how
      DecoderPro looks and how you may use it.</p>

      <p>DecoderPro is also covered in Joe Fugate's <a href=
      "https://trainmasters.tv/videos/2016-11-4">
      TrainMasters.TV video library, episode 2016-11.4</a>, as
      he shows how he used DP on his Siskiyou Line layout.</p>

      <h2>What you need to use DecoderPro</h2>

      <p>DecoderPro will work on Windows, Linux, Macintosh (MacOS
      8.6 through 9.2 and OS X). It will probably also work on most
      other modern operating systems that have Java available;
      contact us for help if you'd like to try it on some other
      system. You need to have a serial port or USB port available,
      either on the computer itself, or via a <a href=
      "../../hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB adapter</a>. For more
      information, please see the <a href=
      "../../setup/index.shtml">Setup pages</a>.</p>

      <p>You also need to have a connection to your DCC system. For
      more information, please see the <a href=
      "../../hardware/index.shtml">DCC hardware
      pages</a>.</p>

      <h2>Decoder Information</h2>

      <p>The JMRI project has compiled a lot of information about
      decoders from many manufacturers, which we make freely
      available in several forms. To learn more, see the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/xml/XSLT/">Decoder Information page</a>.</p>
