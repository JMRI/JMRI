<h1>DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer</h1>

<p>Modern DCC decoders are complicated beasts to program.  The simple idea
of "put the address in CV01" doesn't cope well when you program complicated
functions using combinations of bit patterns.  A friendlier interface is
needed.  There are programs that provide better ways of programming
specific decoders.  Unfortunately, they are limited to specific types of
computers, and only their authors can customize them for new types of
decoders.</p>

<p> The DecoderPro symbolic programmer is meant to improve this. It is
configured using text files, so that it can be adapted to additional
decoder types easily.  It talks to the decoders using the JMRI programming
interface, so that it can run on any computer and layout hardware that JMRI
has been ported to.  It's freely available for download.  And since the
code is available via open source, if you want to improve on it you
can.</p>

<h2>Quick Introduction to Using DecoderPro</h2>

The 
<a href="./Tour.shtml">Quick Tour</a>
page will given you more information on how DecoderPro looks
and the basics of how to use it. 
From there, you can go to the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/index.shtml">full DecoderPro manual</a>
for more information on how to use it, or look at the 
<a href="#guide">User Guide</a> for more
information on how it works.
<p>
DecoderPro is also covered in 
<a HREF="http://mymemoirs.net/model-trains-set1-vol3b.php">Volume 3</a> 
of Joe Fugate's
<a HREF="http://mymemoirs.net/model-trains.php">series of videos<a/>
on DCC topics.</a>

<h2>What You Need to Use DecoderPro</h2>

<p>The DecoderPro software will work on Windows, Linux, Macintosh (OS 8.6
through 9.2 and MacOS X), and OS/2. It will probably also work on most
other modern operating systems that have Java available; contact us for
help if you'd like to try it on some other system. You need to have a
serial port available, either on the computer itself, or via a 
<a HREF="../../hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB adapter</a>. 
For more information, please see the
<a HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/download/index.shtml">download pages</a>.</p>

<p>You also need to have a serial connection to your DCC system.
For more information, please see the
<a HREF="../../hardware/index.shtml">DCC hardware pages</a>.</p>

<h2>What you can do to help</h2>

DecoderPro is the creation of a large number of
<a HREF="../../../Acknowledgements.shtml">volunteers</a>, model railroaders like yourself
who've each contributed to making DecoderPro a great resource
for all of us.  You can help too, even if you're not a 
computer programmer;

<h2>Decoder information</h2>

The JMRI project has compiled a lot of information about decoders from
many manufacturers, which we make freely available in several forms.
