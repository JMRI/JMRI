<h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction to the JMRI Symbolic Programmer</h2>

<p>Current version: 4.2</p>

<p>Modern DCC decoders are complicated beasts to program.  The simple idea
of "put the address in CV01" doesn't cope well when you program complicated
functions using combinations of bit patterns. A friendlier interface is
needed.  There are programs that provide better ways of programming
specific decoders. Unfortunately, they are limited to specific types of
computers, and only their authors can customize them for new types of
decoders.</p>

<p> The DecoderPro symbolic programmer is meant to improve this. It is
configured using text files, so that it can be adapted to additional
decoder types easily. It talks to the decoders using the JMRI programming
interface, so that it can run on any computer and layout hardware that JMRI
has been ported to.  It's freely available for download.  And since the
code is available via open source on <a href="../../doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">GitHub</a>, if you want to improve on it you
can.</p>

<p>The 
<a href="./Tour.shtml">Quick Tour</a> introduces how DecoderPro looks
and how you may use it. 
<p>
DecoderPro is also covered in Joe Fugate's 
<a href="http://trainmasters.tv/videos/3-4-siskiyou-line-dcc-programming-decoderpro" target="_new">TrainMasters.TV video library, part 3.4<a/>, as he shows how he used DP on his Siskiyou Line layout.</a>

<h2>What you need to use DecoderPro</h2>

<p>DecoderPro will work on Windows, Linux, Macintosh (MacOS 8.6
through 9.2 and OS X). It will probably also work on most
other modern operating systems that have Java available; contact us for
help if you'd like to try it on some other system. You need to have a
serial port or USB port available, either on the computer itself, or via a 
<a href="../../hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB adapter</a>. 
For more information, please see the
<a href="../../setup/index.shtml">Setup pages</a>.</p>

<p>You also need to have a connection to your DCC system.
For more information, please see the
<a href="../../hardware/index.shtml">DCC hardware pages</a>.</p>

<h2>Decoder information</h2>
<p>
The JMRI project has compiled a lot of information about decoders from
many manufacturers, which we make freely available in several forms.
