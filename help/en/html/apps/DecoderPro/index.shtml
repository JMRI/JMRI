      <h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>

      <p>Current as for JMRI version 4.2</p>

      <h2>Introduction to the JMRI Symbolic Programmer</h2>

      <p>Modern DCC decoders are complicated beasts to program. The simple idea of "put the address
      in CV01" doesn't cope well when you program complicated functions using combinations of bit
      patterns. A friendlier interface is needed. There are programs that provide better ways of
      programming specific decoders. Unfortunately, they are limited to specific types of
      computers, and only their authors can customize them for new types of decoders.</p>

      <p>The DecoderPro symbolic programmer is meant to improve this. It is configured using text
      files, so that it can be adapted to additional decoder types easily. It talks to the decoders
      using the JMRI programming interface, so that it can run on any computer and layout hardware
      that JMRI has been ported to. It's freely available for download. And since the code is
      available via open source on <a href="../../doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">GitHub</a>, if
      you want to improve on it you can.</p>

      <p>The <a href="./Tour.shtml">Quick Tour</a> introduces how DecoderPro looks and how you may
      use it.</p>

      <p>DecoderPro is also covered in Joe Fugate's <a href=
      "https://trainmasters.tv/videos/2016-11-4">TrainMasters.TV video library, episode
      2016-11.4</a>, as he shows how he used DP on his Siskiyou Line layout.</p>

      <h2>What you need to use DecoderPro</h2>

      <p>DecoderPro will work on Windows, Linux, Macintosh (MacOS 8.6 through 9.2 and OS X). It
      will probably also work on most other modern operating systems that have Java available;
      contact us for help if you'd like to try it on some other system. You need to have a serial
      port or USB port available, either on the computer itself, or via a <a href=
      "../../hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB adapter</a>. For more information, please see the
      <a href="../../setup/index.shtml">Setup pages</a>.</p>

      <p>You also need to have a connection to your DCC system. For more information, please see
      the <a href="../../hardware/index.shtml">DCC hardware pages</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="decoderlisting">Decoder Information</h2>

      <p>The JMRI project has compiled a lot of information about decoders from many manufacturers,
      which we make freely available in several forms. To learn more, see the <a href=
