      <h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>

      <h2>A Short Tour</h2>

      <p class="important">This tour demonstrates DecoderPro
      version 3.x. As of version 4 it was replaced by a new
      interface, before known as <a href=
      "index.shtml">DecoderPro3</a>.</p>

      <div class="image100w">
        <table border="0">
          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align:top;"><a href=
            "./images/DPStart.gif"><img src="./images/DPStart.gif"
            width="100" height="50" alt=
            "DecoderPro welcome screen"></a></td>

            <td style="vertical-align:top;">
              <h3>Startup</h3>When you first open the programmer,
              you see this window. Click the "Program locomotive"
              button to start. (This assumes you have already
              <a href="../../hardware/index.shtml">connected</a>
              your computer to your layout and have a locomotive on
              your programming track)
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align:top;"><a href=
            "./images/SelDecoder.gif"><img src=
            "./images/SelDecoder.gif" width="100" height="100" alt=
            "Decoder Identification"></a></td>

            <td style="vertical-align:top;">
              <h3>Decoder and Programmer selection</h3>

              <p>You'll get a new window to configure the
              programmer with information about a specific type of
              decoder, or an existing locomotive. This will become
              your locomotive roster as you program your
              decoders</p>

              <p>To start working with a newly-installed decoder,
              click the adjacent "Ident" button to have the
              programmer read the decoder and attempt to identify
              it. (You could also explicitly tell the programmer
              the decoder type)</p>

              <p>While the programmer is talking to the decoder,
              status will be displayed in the bottom of the window;
              "Idle" or "OK" means that things are working. If it
              succeeds, it will select the decoder model in the
              selection box. Usually it will only be able to narrow
              the selection down to a few choices. Check that the
              right model is selected in the "Decoder Installed"
              box; update the selection if desired.</p>

              <p>Some people prefer a very simple programmer, and
              some want to have access to every feature. To handle
              this, DecoderPro provides several different
              programming interfaces:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Basic - A simple one, with just the most
                popular information</li>

                <li>Comprehensive - The most complete display, with
                multiple panes of detailed information.</li>

                <li>Advanced - Adds advanced panes to the
                Comprehensive Programmer.</li>

                <li>Registers - Complete configuration for a
                register-only decoder</li>

                <li>Sample Club - A sample of how a club might
                define their own programmer format that shows just
                their set of required variables</li>

                <li>Tutorial - Not useful for actually programming
                decoders, this contains examples of how various
                special effects can be obtained when you're
                constructing your own programmer.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>You can even define your own programmer if you'd
              prefer to just see the variables you use. For this
              example, we select the "Comprehensive" decoder
              programmer in the lowest selection box, and then
              click "Open Programmer" to start working with the
              decoder.</p>

              <h3>Programmer Details</h3>

              <p class="dl">Each of the tabs selects a screen you
              can use to configure different aspects of the
              decoder. The "Basic" pane handles the address other
              settings you'll usually need.</p>

              <p class="dl">Using the buttons -- On the bottom of
              each screen are buttons that will read values from or
              write values to the decoder. For example, to do a
              basic configuration, enter values in the fields and
              click <tt>Write sheet</tt>. The variable fields are
              color coded to represent their states:</p>

              <dl>
                <dt style="color:orange; background:#DDD;">
                Edited</dt>

                <dd>You've changed this value, or it contains
                default values from the decoder file. This is shown
                as orange, since the value differs from what's in
                the decoder.</dd>

                <dt style="color:yellow; background:#DDD;">From
                File</dt>

                <dd>The field contains values read from a
                locomotive file. This is shown as yellow, since
                we're not certain that the file agrees with the
                decoder contents.</dd>

                <dt style="color:white; background:#DDD;">Read</dt>

                <dd>The value shown has been read from the decoder.
                This is shown as white to indicate that the value
                is trustworthy.</dd>

                <dt style="color:white; background:#DDD;">
                Stored</dt>

                <dd>The value show has been written to the decoder.
                This is also shown as white.</dd>

                <dt style="color:red; background:#DDD;">
                Unknown</dt>

                <dd>If something goes wrong with the read or write
                process, we might have a completely untrustworthy
                result. This results in the variable's state being
                marked as UNKNOWN and shown as red.</dd>
              </dl>

            <td style="vertical-align:top;">
              <h3>Examples</h3>

              <p>For example, after a "Read" the speed table values
              are shown as white in the first image, While in the
              second image it shows that when you modify a value,
              its marked as yellow. Doing a write will set it back
              to white; doing a read will reset the value to the
              value in the decoder, and also reset it to white.</p>

            <td style="vertical-align:top;">
              <h3>Complex interactions - Function Mappings</h3>

              <p>Although having a name for an entire CV is nice,
              where this really helps is with complicated
              bit-mapped options. Digitrax FX lighting options, for
              example, require configuring two sets of bits into
              one CV. Another example is configuring a Soundtraxx
              decoder's mapping between functions and sounds. This
              involves bits and values spread across a dozen
              different CVs, but DecoderPro turns that
              configuration job into simple checking of boxes.</p>

              <p>Each selection box, checkbox or radiobutton is
              mapped to specific bit(s) in the decoder's CVs. The
              programmer handles the reading and writing of the CVs
              when the individual settings are changed. Instead of
              bits, you're working with the name or description
              from the decoder manual.</p>

            <td style="vertical-align:top;">
              <h3>Decoder-specific programmer Panels</h3>

              <p>DecoderPro is meant to be easily configurable to
              add new types of decoders. You can also add
              programmer sheets, change their layout, and even redo
              the entire appearance. To do that, DecoderPro is
              driven by human-readable files in XML format.
              Documentation on the file contents exists, and we're
              working to continuously update it.</p>

              <p>These files make it convenient to update
              DecoderPro to work with a new decoder. For example,
              the unique capabilities of a Digitrax DH142 appear on
              a "Digitrax" sheet.</p>

              <p>Additional decoder-specific variables and sheets
              can be added via configuration files. By choosing an
              industry-standard XML format for decoder information,
              we hope to make it possible to create a complete
              library. Perhaps we can even interest manufacturers
              in documenting their products in this format.</p>

              <p>Its also possible to program the CVs directly
              using the CV Programmer. The "Read" and "Write"
              buttons allow you to work with individual CV
              contents. Changes made here will also update any
              associated values found on other programmer
              screens.</p>

              <h3>Locomotive Rosters</h3>

              <p>DecoderPro maintains a roster of your locomotives.
              You can save the decoder configuration, and then
              later work with the stored CV values instead of
              having to read them from the decoder. This saves the
              time it takes to read a complete decoder, which can
              be quite long. The roster can also store locomotive
              information for you. The "Roster Entry" sheet
              displays this info and allows you to edit it.</p>

              <p>Click "Save" to store the roster information to a
              file on your computer's local disk; you'll be
              reminded to do this if you close the programmer with
              any unstored information.</p>

              <p>The "ID" field at the top is the name you'll later
              use to select this locomotive.</p>

            <td style="vertical-align:top;">
              <h3>Selecting a Roster Entry</h3>

              <p>During DecoderPro startup, you can select a
              specific locomotive to work with by using the "Use
              locomotive settings for ..." pulldown menu.</p>

              <p>The "Ident" button uses the DCC address to select
              a specific locomotive in the roster. When you click
              "Open Programmer" with a specific locomotive
              selected, the programmer opens each sheet with the
              current values already present.</p>

              <p>You can print the current locomotive's information
              from the programmer windows. From the "File..." menu,
              select "Print...", and fill out the dialog box that's
              presented.</p>
