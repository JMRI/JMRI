      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <p>This page is the JMRI Decoder Pro "frequently asked
      questions" list. Items get listed here if they're asked a
      lot, even if they're also available somewhere else.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt class="left"><a name="newdecoder" id="newdecoder">How
        can I get a new decoder type defined?</a></dt>

        <dd class="first">
          <a name="newdecoder" id="newdecoder"></a>

          <p>A completely new decoder needs a new or updated
          configuration file. You can <a href=
          "CreateDecoder.shtml">create your own</a> or ask on the
          <a href=
          "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">JMRI
          users Yahoo group</a> for somebody to create one for
          you.</p>

          <p>In many cases, you can use an existing decoder that's
          "close enough". For example, a decoder from the same
          manufacturer that has a different size or current rating
          might have the same configuration CVs, so it's decoder
          definition would work fine.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left"><a name="newfile" id="newfile">What do I
        do with this new decoder file?</a></dt>

        <dd class="first">
          <p>For DecoderPro to use the definition of a decoder type
          in a new decoder file, the new file has to be included in
          DecoderPro's index of decoder types. To do this:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>In your JMRI install directory, you should find a
            directory named "xml". Under that directory, there
            should be one named "decoders". You should put your new
            file in there.</li>

            <li>Now start up DecoderPro, and open the "Debug" menu.
            Select the "Rebuild Decoder Index" option.</li>

            <li>The computer will run for a minute or two with the
            selection highlighted. As soon as that goes away, the
            new definition should be available to you.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please make sure that the new configuration file has
          been contributed to the project so it will be included in
          future releases, and so you won't have to remake the
          index each time you update.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left"><a name="update" id="update">How can I get
        the latest decoder definitions?</a></dt>

        <dd class="first">
          <p>The easiest way to update really is to download a new
          version of the program. This is unlikely to cause
          problems, and automatically installs the latest versions
          of that have been contributed to DecoderPro.</p>

          <p>Updates occur continuously between versions of the
          program. As files are contributed, we make them available
          on our <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/decoders">collected
          decoder definitions</a> web page. You can download them
          from there, but note that most web browsers will not let
          you directly view them; you really do have to download
          them.</p>

          <p>While people are working on decoder definitions, they
          often put their draft definitions in the <a href=
          "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/files">"Files"
          area of the JMRI users Yahoo group</a> (log in to
          access). You can <a href=
          "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/files/Decoder%20files">
          download them from the Decoder Files folder</a>.<br>
          Note that as an anti-spam measure, you will have to
          <a href=
          "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info?showJoinPopup=true">
          join the group</a> to be able to download the files; that
          will require that you have a (free) Yahoo account.</p>

        <dt class="left"><a name="lb-xp" id="lb-xp">Why does my
        LocoBuffer-II not work in Windows XP?</a></dt>

        <dd class="first">
          <p>With Windows XP, your serial port parameters might not
          be properly set for hardware flow control. To fix this,
          right-click on My Computer and select Properties. Go to
          the Hardware tab and click on Device Manager. Open up the
          section that says Ports (COM &amp; LPT). Right-click on
          the serial port you have the LocoBuffer hooked to and
          select Properties. Go to the Port Settings tab and set
          the options to: <em>19200, 8, None, 1, Hardware</em>.
          Click <em>OK</em>. Close the Properties panel. Restart
          JMRI and verify your connection settings.</p>
