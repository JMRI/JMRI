      <h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>

      <h2>Updating Decoder Definitions</h2>Many people have
      contributed decoder definition files to DecoderPro. Between
      new releases, new files may be created that you might want to
      use. These can usually be found either on <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/">the JMRI web site</a> or in
      the <a href=
      "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/files/">files
      area of the JMRI users Yahoo group</a> (log in to access).

      <p>To use these xml files you need to download and install
      them.</p>

      <p>The installation process was simplified in JMRI 2.3.6,
      where "Import Decoder File" and "Import Decoder URL" menu
      items were added to the Debug menu (in PanelPro or "legacy"
      DecoderPro) and to the File menu (in DecoderPro "Roster
      view").</p>

      <h2><a name="after236" id="after236">JMRI v 2.3.6 and
      later</a></h2><a name="after236" id="after236">This section
      describes adding a new decoder definition when you are using
      JMRI version 2.3.6 or later.</a>

      <h3><a name="after236" id="after236">Loading a definition
      from the web</a></h3><a name="after236" id="after236">If you
      have a URL for a decoder definition, perhaps copied from a
      web page or email, and your computer has an active Internet
      connection, you can directly install the definition.</a>

      <ul>
        <li>Copy the URL address from your mail etc.</li>

        <li>Select the "Import Decoder URL" item from the "Debug"
        menu (in PanelPro or "legacy" DecoderPro) or from the File
        menu (in DecoderPro "Roster view").</li>

        <li>You'll be prompted for the URL. Enter it, or paste it
        in and click OK.</li>
      </ul>Unless there are errors, the file will be copied onto
      your local computer and installed in your JMRI Preferences
      directory.<br>

      Configuration Files</a>

      <h3>Loading a definition from a file</h3>If you have local
      file containing a decoder definition, perhaps downloaded from
      a web page or received via email, you can install that
      definition in JMRI.

      <ul>
        <li>Select the "Import Decoder File" item from the "Debug"
        menu (in PanelPro or "legacy" DecoderPro) or from the File
        menu (in DecoderPro "Roster view").</li>

        <li>You'll be shown a file selection dialog.</li>

        <li>If the file doesn't have a ".xml" extension, you may
        have to select the "show all files" filter at the bottom of
        the dialog.</li>

        <li>Navigate to your file, and click OK.</li>
      </ul>Unless there are errors, the file will be copied into
      your JMRI Preferences directory and installed.

      <h3>How This Works</h3>Both of these tools take the decoder
      definition information from the source you indicate and copy
      it to your local JMRI Preferences directory so that it will
      be available from now on. For this to work, you can't already
      have a decoder definition file there by the same name. If
      such a file does exist, the program will indicate an error
      and not replace the file.

      <p>The definition is stored in your Preferences directory,
      instead of the JMRI distribution directory, so that
      installing a new version of JMRI doesn't delete it. Note,
      however, that if a newer version of JMRI comes along with a
      copy of this decoder definition installed, the program will
      give priority to the specific version that you imported. JMRI
      thinks you knew what you were doing when you specifically
      imported that specific version. If you'd prefer to use the
      one in the new JMRI version, you should delete yours from
      your Preferences directory and select "Rebuild Decoder Index"
      in the debug menu.</p>

      <h2><a name="before236" id="before236">JMRI v 2.3.5 and
      earlier</a></h2><a name="before236" id="before236">This
      section describes adding a new decoder definition when you
      are using JMRI version 2.3.5 or before.</a>

      <h3><a name="before236" id="before236">On Windows
      Systems</a></h3>

      <ul>
        <li><a name="before236" id="before236">In Windows Explorer,
        go to the location where the decoder.xml file is located
        and right click on the file.<br>
        (Don't double click or you will open the file rather than
        saving it.)</a></li>

        <li>Choose the menu selection "Save as..." or "Save target
        as...". After you choose this menu item a window will pop
        up and ask you for a location that you want to save the
        file.

          <p>You can either type in a directory name or click the
          browse button. To save a step I suggest that you choose
          "Browse..." and then select the "Program
          files\JMRI\xml\decoders\" directory.</p>

          <p>If you save the file to any other directory, or to the
          desktop, you will have to copy the file over to the
          correct directory using the copy and paste in Windows
          Explorer. It's easier to just save it in the correct
          directory in the first place.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Once the file is in the decoders directory you need to
        open DecoderPro and choose the <strong>Debug</strong> menu
        item. It's one of the menu items on the main menu on the
        opening screen.</li>

        <li>From the drop down Debug menu, choose the item that
        says "Rebuild decoder index". After you have rebuilt the
        decoder index the new decoder should show up in the drop
        down list of the Programmer.

          <p>The key to make this work is that the downloaded .xml
          file needs to be in the JMRI/xml/decoders directory,
          otherwise DecoderPro doesn't know that it is there, and
          won't see it when you rebuild the decoder index.<br>
          Note that a new JMRI install may overwrite your
          customized decoder definition.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>On Mac OS X Systems</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a new folder inside your JMRI Preferences folder
        /Users/me/Library/JMRI/ and name it "decoders"</li>

        <li>Copy or drag the new decoder.xml file into this new
        "decoders" folder.</li>

        <li>From the drop down Debug menu, choose the item that
        says "Rebuild decoder index". After you have rebuilt the
        decoder index, the new decoder should show up in the drop
        down list of the Programmer.</li>
