<h1>DecoderPro User Guide - Updating Decoder Definitions</h1>

Many people have contributed decoder definition
files to DecoderPro.  Between new releases, new files may 
be created that you might want to use.  These can usually be
found either on
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/xml/decoders/">the JMRI web site</a>
or in the 
<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/files/">files area of the jmriusers Yahoo group</a> (log in to access).
<p>
To use these xml files you need to download and install them.

<p>
The installation process was simplified in JMRI 2.3.6, where 
"Import Decoder File" and "Import Decoder URL"
menu items were added to the Debug menu.

<h2>JMRI Version 2.3.6 And After</h2>

This section describes adding a new decoder definition when you are using JMRI
version 2.3.6 or later.

<h3>Loading a definition from the web</h3>
If you have a URL for a decoder definition, perhaps copied from
a web page or email, and your computer has an active Internet connection, 
you can directly install the definition.

<ul>
<li>Select the "Import Decoder URL" item from the "Debug" menu.
<li>Copy the URL address.
<li>Select the "Import Decoder URL" item from the "Debug" menu.
<li>You'll be prompted for the URL. Enter it, or paste it in and click OK.
</ul>

Unless there are errors, the file will be copied onto your local computer
and installed in your JMRI preferences directory.

<h3>Loading a definition from a file</h3>
If you have local file containing a decoder definition, perhaps downloaded from
a web page or received via email, 
you can install that definition in JMRI.

<ul>
<li>Select the "Import Decoder File" item from the "Debug" menu.
<li>You'll be shown a file selection dialog. 
<li>If the file doesn't have a ".xml" extension, you may have to select the "show all files"
filter at the bottom of the dialog.
<li>Navigate to your file, and click OK.
</ul>

Unless there are errors, the file will be copied into your JMRI preferences
directory and installed.

<h3>How This Works</h3>

Both of these tools take the decoder definition information
from the source you indicate and copy it to your local JMRI preferences
directory so that it will be available from now on.  For this to 
work, you can't already have a decoder definition file there by the same name.
If such a file does exist, the program will indicate an error and not 
replace the file.

<p>
The definition is stored in your preferences directory, instead of the JMRI 
distribution directory, so that installing a new version of JMRI doesn't 
delete it.  Note, however, that if a newer version of JMRI comes along with
a copy of this decoder definition installed, the program will give priority to the
specific version that you imported.  JMRI thinks you knew what you were doing
when you specifically imported that specific version.  If you'd prefer to use 
the one in the new JMRI version, just delete yours from your preferences directory
and select "Rebuild Decoder Index" in the debug menu.

<a name="before236">
<h2>JMRI Version 2.3.5 And Before</h2>

This section describes adding a new decoder definition when you are using JMRI
version 2.3.5 or before.

<h3>On Windows Systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to the files menu where the decoder.XML file is located and 
  right click on the file.
 <P>
  (Don't double click or you will open the file rather than saving 
it.)
 
<li>Choose the menu selection "Save as" or "Save target as".  After 
you 
  choose this menu item a window will pop up and ask you for a 
location 
  that you want to save the file.
 
<p> You can either type in a directory name or click the browse 
button.  
  To save a step I suggest that you choose browse and then select 
  the "program files/JMRI/XML/Decoders" directory. 
 
<p>If you save the file to any other directory, or the desktop you 
will 
  have to copy the file over to the correct directory using the copy 
  and paste in Windows Explorer.  It's easier to just save it in the 
  correct directory in the first place.
 
<li>Once the file is in the decoders directory you need to open 
Decoder 
  Pro and choose the Debug menu item.  It's one of the menu items on 
  the top horizontal menu on the opening screen. 
 
<li>From the drop down debug menu choose the item that says "rebuild 
(or 
  recreate) decoder index".  After you have rebuilt the decoder 
index 
  the decoder should show up.
 
<p>The key to make this work is that the downloaded XML file needs to 
be 
  in the JMRI/XML/decoders directory, otherwise Decoder Pro doesn't 
  know that it is there, and won't see it when you rebuild the 
decoder 
  index.
