<h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>
<h2>Creating A Custom Decoder File</h2>

<p>This page provides information on how the decoder definition
files for the DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer work and how to create a new one.</p>

<p>In this user guide, we walk you through the process of creating a
file to describe a new decoder.  You might benefit from reading the
other sections of the DecoderPro user guide to get background
information, especially the 
<a href="IntroXML.shtml">XML introduction</a> and the section on 
<a href="Files.shtml">Configuration Files contents</a>.</p>

<p>The easiest way to create a configuration file is to modify an
existing one.  In this section, we walk you through doing this.</p>

<dl>
<dt class="left">Make a copy of a similar file.</dt>
<dd class=first>
<p>Although you can call this new file anything you like, it will
work best if you use the same convention as the provided files.
That's <tt>"manufacturer name"_"decoder family".xml</tt>, for example:
<tt>Digitrax_1x2.xml</tt> and <tt>Atlas_DualMode.xml</tt></p>

<p>For the provided files, we use the same capitalization, etc,
that the decoder manufacturer uses in their documentation. </p>

<p>This new file should go in the <tt>decoders</tt> subdirectory in the
<tt>JMRI</tt> preferences directory so that the program can find it.  The
<tt>DecoderProConfig2.xml</tt> file lives in the preferences directory, so
you can search for that file to locate it.
(See the <a href="Files.shtml#location"><em>configuration files page</em></a>
for further details
about how to find that directory and it's contents) </p>

<p>If you're modifying a decoder definition, it's best to start with the most
recent version, which can always be found here 
on the JMRI web site at
<a href="http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/">http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/</a>.
That way, it won't be hard to merge your changes with ones that might
have come before.
Please don't do any more reformatting than you have to. If you change
the tech stuff in the top 5 or 10 lines, or
reformat the contents, it gets very hard to tell what's changed and
what has not.

<dt class="left">Edit the new file </dt>
<dd>
<p>Open the new file with your favorite text editor.</p>

</dd>

<dt class="left">File contents: XML Header </dt>
<dd>
<p>You'll see something like this at the top of the file (the examples are from the <a
HREF="../../../../../xml/decoders/0NMRA.xml">0NMRA.xml</a> file):

<p class="example">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;<br>
&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="../XSLT/decoder.xsl"?&gt;<br>
&lt;!-- Copyright (C) JMRI 2001, 2005, 2007, 2-009, 2010 All rights reserved --&gt;<br>
&lt;!-- $Id$ --&gt;<br>
...<br>
&lt;decoder-config xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://jmri.org/xml/schema/decoder.xsd"&gt;<br>
</p>

<p>Don't mess with these lines; they describe the format of the file.
</dd>

<dt class="left"> File contents: Author </dt>
<dd>
<p>The next element describes the author and version of this decoder file:
<p class="example">
&lt;version author="jake@physics.berkeley.edu" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version="1" lastUpdated="20011201"/&gt;
</p>
<p>These attributes are only read by people, not the program, so
their exact format isn't critical.  But we encourage you to insert
your email address in files you create or change, so that if
anybody has any questions they can find you.  The version and
lastUpdated attributes provide a way of telling different versions
of a decoder definition apart, so we'd also like you to update
those.  For a new file, set the version back to "1", and if you're
modifying an existing file, increment the version attribute to the
next number.   </p>
</dd>

<dt class="left"> File contents: Decoder Family and Model</dt>
<dd>
The next lines identify the "family" of decoders that this file
describes:
<p class="example">
&lt;decoder&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;family name="Digitrax 1x2" mfg="Digitrax"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lowVersionID="240" highVersionID="242"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comment="Digitrax DH142, etc" &gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;model model="DH142" numOuts="4" numFns="2"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;model model="DN142" numOuts="4" numFns="2"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;model model="DH083" numOuts="5" numFns="2"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/family&gt;
</p>

<p>The spacing is not important, but its useful to ident the file
like this to make it more readable.  XML uses "elements" and
"attributes" to carry information.  The &lt;model&gt; things are
elements; attributes like numOuts are set to specific values within elements.
In the 2nd through 4th lines above

<p class="example">
&lt;family name="Digitrax 1x2" mfg="Digitrax"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lowVersionID="240" highVersionID="242"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comment="Digitrax DH142, etc" &gt;
</p>

<p>the element is 'family', with attributes 'name', 'mfg',
'lowVersionID', 'highVersionID', and 'comment'.  An attribute is
given a value with an equals sign and a value in quotes (the quotes
are required).  The order of the attributes is not important, and
you can break them across lines if that makes the file easier to
read. Note that all of the attributes must be inside the angle
brackets, and after the name of the element.</p>

<p>In this element, change the attributes to match your new decoder:
<ul>
<li><dfn>name</dfn> - the name of the decoder family.  Its best if you use the same
name here as you used in the filename.
<li><dfn>mfg</dfn> - the manufacturer of the decoder.  Its best if you use the same
manufacturer name here as you used in the filename.
<li><dfn>lowVersionID</dfn>, <dfn>highVersionID</dfn> -
The manufacturer can load a version number into CV 7 of a decoder.
Not all manufacturers do this, but if one is available the
programmer can check if this file is being used with the expected
decoder type.  If only one specific value is valid, define the both 
lowVersionID and highVersionID with the same value, e.g.

<p class="example">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lowVersionID="123"&nbsp;highVersionID="123"
</p>
If the decoder type can have any one of a range of numbers,
for example because the manufacturer has made some updates,
define both attributes to cover the range:

<p class="example">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lowVersionID="21"&nbsp;highVersionID="42"
</p>
If you don't know the version number, don't define
either of these attributes; just leave them off.
lowVersionID defaults to 0, highVersionID defaults to 255, 
so together the defaults mean "any value".

<li><dfn>comment</dfn> - this is optional. You might want to include your name, or other
info about the changes in the file.
</ul>

<p> The following lines:</p>

<p class="example">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;model model="DH142" numOuts="4" numFns="2"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;model model="DN142" numOuts="4" numFns="2"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;model model="DH083" numOuts="5" numFns="2"/&gt;
</p>
allow you to list a number of different decoder models that can use
this file.  For a single decoder, remove all but one of the "model"
elements, and give it the model name of the decoder.  The numOuts
and numFns are described later, but for now you can just delete
them, leaving something like:</p>

<p class="example">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;model model="DH142" /&gt;
</p>

The model element can also contain lowVersionID and/or highVersionID
attributes, which apply to just that model. If one doesn't
appear, the value from the family element (or its default) will be used.

</dd>

<dt class="left"> File contents: Programming Modes </dt>
<dd>

<p>The next element defines what programming modes the decoder can understand:</p>

<p class="example">
&lt;programming direct="byteOnly" paged="yes" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;register="yes" ops="yes"&gt;&lt;/programming&gt;
</p>

<p>Paged, register and ops can be set to either "yes" or "no".  Direct
can be set to "no", "bitOnly", "byteOnly", or "yes".  The
programmer uses this information to select the programming mode to
use when working with a decoder.</p>
</dd>

<A name="variable">
<dt class="left"> File contents: Variable names</dt></a>
<dd>
<p>The next part of the file consists of a set of 'variable' elements
defining specific variables, nested inside a 'variables' (note the
extra "s") element. An example:</p>

<p class="example">
&lt;variables&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;variable CV="1" item="Primary Address" default="03"&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;decVal min="1" max="127"/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;label&gt;Short Address&lt;/label&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;comment&gt;NMRA standard form&lt;/comment&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tooltip&gt;Digitrax systems only address 1-99&lt;/tooltip&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/variable&gt;<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;(followed by more &lt;variable&gt; entries)<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;(Insert new ones at the end)<br>
&lt;/variables&gt;  
</p>

<p>Each variable represents one thing to configure.  They can represent a
single CV, e.g. address, or a few bits that can be configured to
control a particular function.  If some of these aren't appropriate to
your decoder, you can just remove them.  Make sure you remove the
entire element from the &lt;variable&gt; to the matching
&lt;/variable&gt;.  You can also rearrange them if you'd prefer a
different order.</p>

<p> The attributes include:
<ul>
<li><dfn>item</dfn> - The 'standard' name for this variable. See the
<a href="Programmer.shtml#id">discussion on the programmer definition page</a> 
for more information on this.  Generally, look at the Comprehensive programmer
to find something similar, and use the "name" attribute of that.
<li><dfn>CV</dfn> - Which CV contains the configuration information
for this variable.
<li><dfn>mask</dfn> - A pattern like "XXXVVVXX" which controls which
bits in the CV make up the variable. Each "V" is a bit
that's included, and "X" are bits that are not to be
included.  Its best to have eight characters, as that
makes it clearer what's going on.  If the variable
is a full byte, this attribute can be omitted.
<li><dfn>default</dfn> - The default value for this variable. This is
used for a new decoder, or when you want to set the
decoder back to its defaults.
</ul>

<p>(There are a few more, which we'll leave for the advanced section below)</p>
<p>The "label" included element provides a human-comfortable name for this variable. This is generally what
the decoder manufacturer calls this item, even if other manufacturers or the
NMRA use a different name for similar things. It's optional, in which case the "item"
value will be used to label it when it's presented to the user.
<p>The "comment" element let you provide additional information
to future developers.  This information is visible when editing the 
definition, but isn't provided to somebody who's just using DecoderPro.
<p>The "tooltip" element let you provide additional information
to the user when the user hovers their
cursor over the variable on the screen. 
</dd>

<dt class="left"> File contents: Creating new Variable definitions</dt>
<dd>
<p>You can also define new variables. A good starting point is to
copy a similar definition, change its item name to a new value, and then
edit its contents.</p>

<p> To define how the new variable is displayed and edited, you
add elements within the 'variable' element.  There are several
possible forms:
<ul>
<li>For a decimal value, you include a decVal element like the
example above.  The two optional attributes are min and max,
which define the range of acceptable values. If you
omit them, values from 0 to 255 are allowed.
<li>If you'd rather enter and display values in hexadecimal, use a
'hexVal' element. Its otherwise the same as the
'decVal' element we've already discussed.
<li><p>If your decoder supports a long address, you can add a
'longAddress' element. Its perhaps easiest to copy
this from another file, or from this example:</p>

<p class="example">
&lt;variable item=&quot;Long Address&quot; CV=&quot;17&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;longAddressVal/&gt;<br>
&lt;/variable&gt;
</p>

<li><p>If your decoder supports it, you can enter a 'speedTableVal'
element for the speed table.  Optional attributes are:  "entries", "min", "max" and
"mfx" (when true enables the M&auml;rklin mfx&reg; style speed table).  Example:</p>

<p class="example">
&lt;variable item=&quot;Speed Table&quot; CV=&quot;67&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;speedTableVal/&gt;<br>
&lt;/variable&gt;
</p>

<li>Some decoder options are best represented by "choose one
choice". These are represented by a enumVariable element. Example:

<p class="example">
&lt;variable item=&quot;F6 during DC operation&quot; CV=&quot;13&quot; mask=&quot;XXVXXXXX&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;enumVal&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;enumChoice choice=&quot;Off&quot;/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;enumChoice choice=&quot;On&quot;/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/enumVal&gt;<br>
&lt;/variable&gt;
</p>

<p>Each enumChoice element describes one possibility.  There can be as
many of these as desired.  For a one bit choice, you use two
enumChoice elements as in the example.  For a 4 bit choice, like
the FX codes in a Digitrax decoder, you can use up to 16 choices.
They are displayed in the order they are entered in the file, and
are also numbered in that order.  If the first is chosen, a 0 is
entered in the CV bits; choosing the second stores 1; etc.</p>

<p> If you need to specific a specific number for an enum option,
add a "value" attribute:
<p class="example">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;enumChoice choice=&quot;Blue&quot; value=&quot;32&quot;/&gt;
</p>
</ul>

<dt class="left"> Checking for syntax errors</dt>
<dd>
<p>At this point, you've created a new configuration file!</p>

<p>You can check it for syntax by selecting the "Validate XML file"
item from the "Debug" menu.  It opens a file selection dialog;
select your file and click "open".  If all is well, you'll get a
dialog box that says "OK".  If not, you'll get a completely
incomprehensible error message. About the only useful part of that
message is the line number; open an editor to that line and try to
see what's wrong with the syntax.
</dd>

<dt class="left"> Add the file to the index</dt>
<dd>
<p>All that's left is to enter your new file in the index.  This
index is used to speed the startup of the program, when the list of
available decoders is constructed.</p>

<p> Select the "Create decoder index" item from the "Debug"
menu.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Congratulations!  You're done.  Next, open the programmer
application and try it.</p>
