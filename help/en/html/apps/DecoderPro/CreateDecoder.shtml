      <h2>Creating A Custom Decoder File</h2>

      <p>This page provides information on how the decoder
      definition files for the DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer work
      and how to create a new one.</p>

      <p>In this user guide, we walk you through the process of
      creating a file to describe a new decoder. You might benefit
      from reading the other sections of the DecoderPro user guide
      to get background information, especially the <a href=
      "IntroXML.shtml">XML introduction</a> and the section on
      <a href="Files.shtml">Configuration Files contents</a>.</p>

      <p>The easiest way to create a configuration file is to
      modify an existing one. In this section, we walk you through
      doing this.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt class="left">Make a copy of a similar file.</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          <p>Although you can call this new file anything you like,
          it will work best if you use the same convention as the
          provided files. That's <tt>"manufacturer name"_"decoder
          family".xml</tt>, for example: <tt>Digitrax_1x2.xml</tt>
          and <tt>Atlas_DualMode.xml</tt></p>

          <p>For the provided files, we use the same
          capitalization, etc, that the decoder manufacturer uses
          in their documentation.</p>

          <p>This new file should go in the <tt>decoders</tt>
          subdirectory in the <tt>JMRI</tt> preferences directory
          so that the program can find it. The
          <tt>DecoderProConfig2.xml</tt> file lives in the
          preferences directory, so you can search for that file to
          locate it. (See the <a href=
          "Files.shtml#location"><em>configuration files
          page</em></a> for further details about how to find that
          directory and its contents)</p>

          <p>If you're modifying a decoder definition, it is best to
          start with the most recent version, which can always be
          found here on the JMRI web site at <a href=
          "http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/">http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/</a>.
          That way, it won't be hard to merge your changes with
          ones that might have come before. Please don't do any
          more reformatting than you have to. If you change the
          tech stuff in the top 5 or 10 lines, or reformat the
          contents, it gets very hard to tell what's changed and
          what has not.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Edit the new file</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Open the new file with your favorite text editor.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">File contents: XML Header</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>You'll see something like this at the top of the file
          (the examples are from the <a href=
          "../../../../../xml/decoders/0NMRA.xml">0NMRA.xml</a>
          file):</p>

          <p class="example">&lt;?xml version="1.0"
          encoding="utf-8"?&gt;<br>
          &lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl"
          href="../XSLT/decoder.xsl"?&gt;<br>

          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://jmri.org/xml/schema/decoder.xsd"&gt;<br>
          </p>

          <p>Don't mess with these lines; they describe the format
          of the file.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">File contents: Author</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The next element describes the author and version of
          this decoder file:</p>

          <p class="example">&lt;version
          author="jake@physics.berkeley.edu"<br>
              version="1" lastUpdated="20011201"/&gt;</p>

          <p>These attributes are only read by people, not the
          program, so their exact format isn't critical. But we
          encourage you to insert your email address in files you
          create or change, so that if anybody has any questions
          they can find you. The version and lastUpdated attributes
          provide a way of telling different versions of a decoder
          definition apart, so we'd also like you to update those.
          For a new file, set the version back to "1", and if
          you're modifying an existing file, increment the version
          attribute to the next number.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">File contents: Decoder Family and
        Model</dt>

        <dd>
          The next lines identify the "family" of decoders that
          this file describes:

          <p class="example">&lt;decoder&gt;<br>
              &lt;family name="Digitrax 1x2" mfg="Digitrax"<br>
                  lowVersionID="240" highVersionID="242"<br>
                  comment="Digitrax DH142, etc" &gt;<br>
                  &lt;model model="DH142" numOuts="4"
          numFns="2"/&gt;<br>
                  &lt;model model="DN142" numOuts="4"
          numFns="2"/&gt;<br>
                  &lt;model model="DH083" numOuts="5"
          numFns="2"/&gt;<br>
              &lt;/family&gt;</p>

          <p>The spacing is not important, but it is useful to indent
          the file like this to make it more readable. XML uses
          "elements" and "attributes" to carry information. The
          &lt;model&gt; things are elements; attributes like
          numOuts are set to specific values within elements. In
          the 2nd through 4th lines above</p>

          <p class="example">&lt;family name="Digitrax 1x2"
          mfg="Digitrax"<br>
              lowVersionID="240" highVersionID="242"<br>
              comment="Digitrax DH142, etc" &gt;</p>

          <p>the element is 'family', with attributes 'name',
          'mfg', 'lowVersionID', 'highVersionID', and 'comment'. An
          attribute is given a value with an equals sign and a
          value in quotes (the quotes are required). The order of
          the attributes is not important, and you can break them
          across lines if that makes the file easier to read. Note
          that all of the attributes must be inside the angle
          brackets, and after the name of the element.</p>

          <p>In this element, change the attributes to match your
          new decoder:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><dfn>name</dfn> - the name of the decoder family.
            It's best if you use the same name here as you used in
            the filename.</li>

            <li><dfn>mfg</dfn> - the manufacturer of the decoder.
            It's best if you use the same manufacturer name here as
            you used in the filename.</li>

            <li>
              <dfn>lowVersionID</dfn>, <dfn>highVersionID</dfn> -
              The manufacturer can load a version number into CV 7
              of a decoder. Not all manufacturers do this, but if
              one is available the programmer can check if this
              file is being used with the expected decoder type. If
              only one specific value is valid, define the both
              lowVersionID and highVersionID with the same value,
              e.g.

              <p class="example">    lowVersionID="123"
              highVersionID="123"</p>If the decoder type can have
              any one of a range of numbers, for example because
              the manufacturer has made some updates, define both
              attributes to cover the range:

              <p class="example">    lowVersionID="21"
              highVersionID="42"</p>If you don't know the version
              number, don't define either of these attributes; just
              leave them off. lowVersionID defaults to 0,
              highVersionID defaults to 255, so together the
              defaults mean "any value".
            </li>

            <li><dfn>comment</dfn> - this is optional. You might
            want to include your name, or other info about the
            changes in the file.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The following lines:</p>

          <p class="example">    &lt;model model="DH142"
          numOuts="4" numFns="2"/&gt;<br>
              &lt;model model="DN142" numOuts="4"
          numFns="2"/&gt;<br>
              &lt;model model="DH083" numOuts="5"
          numFns="2"/&gt;</p>allow you to list a number of
          different decoder models that can use this file. For a
          single decoder, remove all but one of the "model"
          elements, and give it the model name of the decoder. The
          numOuts and numFns are described later, but for now you
          can just delete them, leaving something like:

          <p class="example">    &lt;model model="DH142"
          /&gt;</p>The model element can also contain lowVersionID
          and/or highVersionID attributes, which apply to just that
          model. If one doesn't appear, the value from the family
          element (or its default) will be used.

          <p>It is important to note that
          <em>the 'family'+'model' combination must be unique</em>.
          This is the <em>only</em> information that can be used to match
          a decoder definition to an existing roster entry.
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>There can be multiple instances of model 'x'
              but they must reside in different families.</li>
              <li>There can be multiple definitions of family 'y'
              (in different decoder files) but model 'x'
              can only appear within one of these.</li>
              <li>The 'family'+'model' uniqueness restriction
              applies irrespective of manufacturer.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">File contents: Programming Modes</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The next element defines what programming modes the
          decoder can understand:</p>

          <p class="example">&lt;programming direct="byteOnly"
          paged="yes"<br>
              register="yes" ops="yes"&gt;&lt;/programming&gt;</p>

          <p>Paged, register and ops can be set to either "yes" or
          "no". Direct can be set to "no", "bitOnly", "byteOnly",
          or "yes". The programmer uses this information to select
          the programming mode to use when working with a
          decoder.</p>
        </dd>

        <dd><a name="variable" id="variable"></a></dd>

        <dt class="left">File contents: Variable names</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The next part of the file consists of a set of
          'variable' elements defining specific variables, nested
          inside a 'variables' (note the extra "s") element. An
          example:</p>

          <p class="example">&lt;variables&gt;<br>
            &lt;variable CV="1" item="Primary Address"
          default="03"&gt;<br>
              &lt;decVal min="1" max="127"/&gt;<br>
              &lt;label&gt;Short Address&lt;/label&gt;<br>
              &lt;comment&gt;NMRA standard form&lt;/comment&gt;<br>
              &lt;tooltip&gt;Digitrax systems only address
          1-99&lt;/tooltip&gt;<br>
            &lt;/variable&gt;<br>
          <br>
            (followed by more &lt;variable&gt; entries)<br>
          <br>
            (Insert new ones at the end)<br>
          &lt;/variables&gt;</p>

          <p>Each variable represents one thing to configure. They
          can represent a single CV, e.g. address, or a few bits
          that can be configured to control a particular function.
          If some of these aren't appropriate to your decoder, you
          can just remove them. Make sure you remove the entire
          element from the &lt;variable&gt; to the matching
          &lt;/variable&gt;. You can also rearrange them if you'd
          prefer a different order.</p>

          <p>The attributes include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><dfn>item</dfn> - The 'standard' name for this
            variable. See the <a href=
            "Programmer.shtml#id">discussion on the programmer
            definition page</a> for more information on this.
            Generally, look at the Comprehensive programmer to find
            something similar, and use the "name" attribute of
            that.</li>

            <li><dfn>CV</dfn> - Which CV contains the configuration
            information for this variable.</li>

            <li><dfn>mask</dfn> - A pattern like "XXXVVVXX" which
            controls which bits in the CV make up the variable.
            Each "V" is a bit that's included, and "X" are bits
            that are not to be included. It's best to have eight
            characters, as that makes it clearer what's going on.
            If the variable is a full byte, this attribute can be
            omitted.
            <p>
            Generally, the V characters should be a contiguous block 
            of bits as specified in the manufacturer's documentation
            for the decoder.  In certain rare cases, the
            layout of the decoder might
            require a different pattern like XXVVXXVV, but 
            in those cases please check the operation of the 
            resulting decoder definition carefully to make sure it 
            does what you want.
            
            <p>
            As another special case, this can also be used (along with 
            some other attributes) to handle CVs that are coded in
            bases other than binary:  Ones that store their 
            parts as decimal digits, or even base 3 or 5.
            That's a bit more technical, it's rarely needed, but 
            if you do need it see the 
            <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/symbolicprog/VariableValue.html">javadoc for more details</a>.

            <li><dfn>default</dfn> - The default value for this
            variable. This is used for a new decoder, or when you
            want to set the decoder back to its defaults.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>(There are a few more, which we'll leave for the
          advanced section below)</p>

          <p>The "label" included element provides a
          human-comfortable name for this variable. This is
          generally what the decoder manufacturer calls this item,
          even if other manufacturers or the NMRA use a different
          name for similar things. It is optional, in which case the
          "item" value will be used to label it when it's presented
          to the user.</p>

          <p>The "comment" element let you provide additional
          information to future developers. This information is
          visible when editing the definition, but isn't provided
          to somebody who's just using DecoderPro.</p>

          <p>The "tooltip" element let you provide additional
          information to the user when the user hovers their cursor
          over the variable on the screen.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">File contents: Creating new Variable
        definitions</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>You can also define new variables. A good starting
          point is to copy a similar definition, change its item
          name to a new value, and then edit its contents.</p>

          <p>To define how the new variable is displayed and
          edited, you add elements within the 'variable' element.
          There are several possible forms:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>For a decimal value, you include a decVal element
            like the example above. The two optional attributes are
            min and max, which define the range of acceptable
            values. If you omit them, values from 0 to 255 are
            allowed.</li>

            <li>If you'd rather enter and display values in
            hexadecimal, use a 'hexVal' element. It's otherwise the
            same as the 'decVal' element we've already
            discussed.</li>

            <li>
              <p>If your decoder supports a long address, you can
              add a 'longAddress' element. It's perhaps easiest to
              copy this from another file, or from this
              example:</p>

              <p class="example">&lt;variable item="Long Address"
              CV="17"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;longAddressVal/&gt;<br>
              &lt;/variable&gt;</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>If your decoder supports it, you can enter a
              'speedTableVal' element for the speed table. Optional
              attributes are: "entries", "min", "max" and "mfx"
              (when true enables the M&auml;rklin mfx&reg; style
              speed table). Example:</p>

              <p class="example">&lt;variable item="Speed Table"
              CV="67"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;speedTableVal/&gt;<br>
              &lt;/variable&gt;</p>
            </li>

            <li>Some decoder options are best represented by
            "choose one choice". These are represented by a
            enumVariable element. Example:

              <p class="example">&lt;variable item="F6 during DC
              operation" CV="13" mask="XXVXXXXX"&gt;<br>
                  &lt;enumVal&gt;<br>
                      &lt;enumChoice choice="Off"/&gt;<br>
                      &lt;enumChoice choice="On"/&gt;<br>
                  &lt;/enumVal&gt;<br>
              &lt;/variable&gt;</p>

              <p>Each enumChoice element describes one possibility.
              There can be as many of these as desired. For a one
              bit choice, you use two enumChoice elements as in the
              example. For a 4 bit choice, like the FX codes in a
              Digitrax decoder, you can use up to 16 choices. They
              are displayed in the order they are entered in the
              file, and are also numbered in that order. If the
              first is chosen, a 0 is entered in the CV bits;
              choosing the second stores 1; etc.</p>

              <p>If you need to specific a specific number for an
              enum option, add a "value" attribute:</p>

              <p class="example">    &lt;enumChoice choice="Blue"
              value="32"/&gt;</p>
              
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Including fragment files</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Decoder definitions can include "fragment files"
          which provide common definitions of some CVs.
          This has the advantage that they're already created and 
          tested, and often include tooltip text, translations 
          and other nice features.  See the existing 
          decoder definitions for 
          <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/nmra">examples</a>.  
          Some key ones:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>CV1, the primary or short address, 
                    CV17 and 18, the extended or long address,
                    and the corresponding CV29 bits can 
                    be handled by one of these, depending
                    on what the decode supports:
                    <ul>
                    <li>xml/decoders/nmra/shortAddressOnly.xml
                    <li>xml/decoders/nmra/shortAndLongAddress.xml
                    </ul>
                <li>CV19, the consist address and direction, 
                    can be handled by one of these:
                    <ul>
                    <li>xml/decoders/nmra/consistAddr.xml	
                    <li>xml/decoders/nmra/consistAddrDirection.xml
                    </ul>
                 <li>The CV16/CV15 decoder lock feature can be 
                    handled by the xml/decoders/nmra/decoderLockId16.xml
                    fragment file. Note that only CV16 is included;
                    CV15 should not be included in the definition
                    to prevent it from being changed after decoder
                    installation.   
                </ul>
         
         <p>You can also use fragment files to include (hence simplify)
         <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/parts">common sets of enum choices</a>.</p> 
        </dd>
        <dt class="left">Checking for syntax errors</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>At this point, you've created a new configuration
          file!</p>

          <p>You can check it for syntax by selecting the "Validate
          XML file" item from the "Debug" menu. It opens a file
          selection dialog; select your file and click "open". If
          all is well, you'll get a dialog box that says "OK". If
          not, you'll get a completely incomprehensible error
          message. About the only useful part of that message is
          the line number; open an editor to that line and try to
          see what's wrong with the syntax.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Add the file to the index</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>All that's left is to enter your new file in the
          index. This index is used to speed the startup of the
          program, when the list of available decoders is
          constructed.</p>

          <p>Select the "Recreate decoder index" item from the
          DecoderPro "Actions" menu or the PanelPro "Debug" menu.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Congratulations! You're done. Next, open the programmer
      application and try it.</p>
