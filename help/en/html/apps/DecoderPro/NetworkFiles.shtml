      <h1>JMRI: DecoderPro User Guide</h1>

      <h2>Sharing DecoderPro Rosters across a
      Network</h2><strong>Note:</strong>

      <p><strong>The information on this page is somewhat dated in
      terms of file locations, Preferences settings and a
      recommended solution. For more up-to-date information see
      <a href="../../setup/Dropbox.shtml">Using
      DropBox</a>.</strong></p>A common question:

      <blockquote>
        I have a computer at both my workbench, where I program my
        engines, and one at my layout location. They are not
        portable, but all the PC's at my house are networked
        together (Windows XP clients and a Windows 2000 Server). I
        would like to store the roster and all else that is needed
        on the Windows 2000 server and be able to run copies of
        DecoderPro on at lease two of the Windows XP PC's. Is that
        possible?
      </blockquote>Yes!

      <p>Configure the Windows machines so there's a shared
      directory, and then you can set the JMRI "advanced
      preferences" to put the roster information inside that.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Set up a shared directory.</li>

        <li>Select which roster you want to start with (since there
        might be separate ones on different machines already). On
        that machine, find the "roster.xml" file and "roster"
        directory in the preferences directory.

          <p>For more information, please see the DecoderPro pages
          on the <a href="RosterFile.shtml">roster files</a> and
          <a href="Files.shtml#location">file locations</a>.</p>

          <p>Copy, _do not move_, the roster.xml file and roster
          folder to the shared folder. You must copy the _entire_
          contents of the roster directory!</p>
        </li>

        <li>On each machine that is to use the shared roster, start
        DecoderPro, select Preferences from the Edit menu, and
        click "Show Advanced Preferences". The window will get
        bigger. Press "Set" under "Roster:" and follow
        directions.</li>
