      <h2>Debugging</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt class="left">While the program is running</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          <p>While the program is running, debugging information is
          printed to "standard output", which is in different
          places depending on what operating system you're using
          and how you started the program. On a Macintosh classic,
          it appears in a window that's created with the first
          error message. With Mac OS X, it may appear in a new
          window, or you may have to launch the "Console"
          application to see it. On Windows, you may have to run
          one the "Debug" batch files to see the error messages;
          look for them in the application's directory.</p>

          <p>Error logging is controlled by the "default.lcf" file.
          It has lots of comments on what the various terms mean.
          If you'd like messages to be logged to a file, change the
          line</p>

          <p class="example">log4j.rootCategory= WARN, A1</p>

          <p>to include the additional logging destination "R":</p>

          <p class="example">log4j.rootCategory= WARN, A1,R</p>

          <p>R is defined later in default.lcf as logging to the
          "example.log" file. You can also get a lot of additional
          information on what the program is doing by setting the
          log level to either INFO or DEBUG, e.g.</p>

          <p class="example">log4j.rootCategory= INFO, A1</p>

          <p>Note that the DEBUG level will output a lot of
          information, and will slow down operation significantly.
          Its also possible to request more information on just
          parts of the program, but in order for that to be useful
          you have to have spent some time learning about the
          internals.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Debugging problems with XML files</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>When an XML file can't be parsed, you'll get some
          hard-to-understand error messages. The most important
          part of this is the line number. Use that to start
          looking for the problem.</p>

          <p>You might be able to get better debugging information
          by trying to open the file with Internet Explorer. The
          debugging information it provides is generally more
          detailed than that provided by the XML routines in the
          JDOM libraries used by JMRI and DecoderPro.</p>

          <p>Note that Explorer needs to see both the .xml file,
          plus the definition information in the .dtd file. If you
          get a message like "error in system resource", you need
          to put a copy of the associated .dtd file (e.g.
          decoder-config.dtd) in the directory with your new file.
          DTD's can be found in the dtd subdirectory of the xml
          directory.</p>
