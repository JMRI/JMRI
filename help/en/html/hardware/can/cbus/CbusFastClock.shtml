      <span class="since">Since 4.19.6</span>
      
      <p>JMRI maintains an Internal Fast Clock which is used in various places
        including RfID Tag Timestamping, and layout automation tools.
      </p>

      <p>The CBUS Fast Clock can be used to send this internal clock data to a CBUS Network, 
        enabling other network devices to use the same time and date.
      </p>

      <p>JMRI can also listen to the CBUS Network for incoming Fast Clock data which is used
        to update the internal clock.</p>
      
      <p>If you aren't sharing time data across the network, the internal Fast Clock will provide
        all of the functionality you need, without having to send or receive it via CBUS.</p>

      <p>Internal Fast Clock, and extra CBUS functionality are configured in the main 
      <a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/simpleclock/SimpleClockFrame.shtml">Fast Clock Setup Window</a>,
        <br><strong>PanelPro > Tools > Clocks > Set Up Fast Clock ...</strong></p>
      

      <h2><a name="outbound" id="outbound">Sending Fast Clock data to Network</a></h2>
      
        <div style="float: right;"><img src="images/web/cbus_fastclock_incoming_420x606.png" 
        alt="CBUS Fast Clock Incoming" width="420" height="606"></div>
      
        <p>Open up the Fast Clock Setup Window.</p>
      
        <p>Ensure that Internal Computer Clock is selected as the time source.</p>
      
        <p>Check the Synchronise CBUS Fast Clock checkbox.</p>

        <p>The Fast Clock Configuration is stored in xml, remember to store your setup!</p>

        <p>When the clock is paused / resumed, the appropriate CBUS FCLK message is sent.</p>

        <p>Each time the Internal Fast Clock rolls over a minute, a CBUS FCLK message will be sent.</p>

        <p>Data includes clock speed rate, minute, hour, day of month, day of week, month, 
        and a temperature field ( which defaults to 0 ).</p>
        
        <p>If the Internal Fast Clock Speed Rate is not a whole number, the Fast Clock Rate ( DIV value )
        will be sent excluding the decimal ( ie no rounding up ).
        For a receiving Fast Clock to accurately calculate second changes this should be set to 
        a whole number, however for many applications this is not a requirement.
        </p>

      
      
      <h2><a name="inbound" id="inbound">Receiving Fast Clock data from Network</a></h2>

        <p>Open up the Fast Clock Setup Window.</p>
      
        <p>Ensure that CBUS Fast Clock is selected as the time source.</p>
      
        <p>Check the Synchronise CBUS Fast Clock checkbox.</p>

        <p>The master JMRI date and time will now be set whenever CBUS FCLK OPCs are heard on the network.</p>
        
        <p>The master JMRI clock will be paused and resumed according to the incoming CBUS FLCK OPCs.</p>
        
        <p>The Clock speed rate and CBUS Fast Clock temperature fields are also updated.</p>
        
        <p>If an external Fast Clock is not sending updates ( and the clock is not paused ),
        the Internal Clock will continue updating the master JMRI time.</p>

        <p>This behaviour is likely undesirable on startup, so you may to have the master clock paused on startup.
        <br> Start Up Options > Start with Fast Clock > Stopped</p>
        
        <p>The Fast Clock Configuration is stored in xml, remember to store your setup!</p>
        
        <p>Initially, JMRI attempts to update the whole date, using the minute, hour, day of month, and month fields.
        <br>If this is impossible ( eg. 29th feb in non-leap year / month 17 ), a second attempt
        is made to set the Internal clock using just the hour / minute fields, and the current clock date.</p>
        
      

      <h4>Pausing and Resuming Internal Clock via CBUS Event</h4>
      
      
        <p>The JMRI master clock can be paused / resumed by CBUS event.</p>

        <p>After you've set the clock running for the first time, there will be a new Internal Sensor called "ISCLOCKRUNNING".</p>

        <p>Use Logix ( or Light Control ) to set a CBUS Sensor ( operated via CBUS event ) to command this Internal Sensor 
            to On and Off for a remote pause / resume by CBUS event.</p>

        <p>For multiple operators, the pause buttons could send an OFF, 
        with a master resume button sending the ON.</p>



      <h4>Triggering CBUS Events by Fast Clock</h4>

        <p>To send on / off CBUS events at certain fast times, use Light Controls or Logix.</p>

        <p>CBUS Lights are a good choice for beginners, sending ON / OFF events whenever they are switched on / off.</p>
        
        <p>You can add lots of simple automation tasks with these by using Fast Clock Light Controllers.</p>
        
        <p>This enables scheduled tasks, eg Streetlights, house lights, sunset / sunrise etc. </p>


      <h4>Accessing the Date / Temperature Fields</h4>
      
        <p>The fast clock time will be updated in a JMRI memory variable.
        <br>This format can be changed to include day, month and year, see main JMRI Fast Clock support.
        </p>
      
        <p>Jython scripting can set the date, along with getting and setting the temperature field.</p>
      
        <p>eg. A script could listen for a particular event which could carry a temperature value
        in its added data.
        </p>
