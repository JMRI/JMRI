      <h2><a name="events" id="events">Event Name and Numbering</a></h2>
      
        <h3>Event Conventions</h3>
          <div>
        <h4>Short Event Suggestions</h4>
            <p>Suggestion from Mike Bolton :</p>
            
            <p>His club has adopted the convention of 1 to 9999 for turnouts 
            and 10000 upwards for sensors. 
            <br>
            This prevents the possibility of sending sensor events from 
            their CANCABs (9999 max) 
            <br>but they tie any relevant sensors to the turnout numbers 
            e.g. 
            <br>TO_1 is +1 and the feedback from this is +10001 for one 
            way and +11001 for the other way. 
            <br>
            Using short events (or device numbers) this way makes life 
            very simple with JMRI. 
            <br>They control the turnouts from the CANCABs as well (also 
            Smartphone throttles), this is reflected in the JMRI panel and works a treat!
            <br>Their layout control panel is on a touchscreen monitor 
            connected to a RPi 3B running JMRI,
            with additional control panels through 
            <a href="../../../web/index.shtml">JMRI Web Server</a>.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Another use of event segmentation could be for modular club layouts, 
            
            where various club members building a section at home, 
            then bringing it together into 1 big super layout.
            <br>
            Module 1 would have events 1,000 > 1,999 Module 2 would have 2,000 > 2,999 etc.
            </p>
            
            
            <h4>Long Event Suggestions</h4>
            
            <p>Suggestion from Pete Brownlow:</p>
            <p>Pete uses pretty much exclusively long events.
            <br>For events sent from JMRI, he segments by node number that JMRI generates 
            (for example, node 99 for turnouts, node 98 for signals and node 97 for control sensors). 
            <br>This makes it very easy to see what the events are for when looking at an event log. 
            <br>For all input sensors from CBUS, he leaves the long event as generated by the CBUS module, 
            so it will retain the node number of that module, 
            (eg; Node 256 event 1) so there's no risk of generating the same event as a cab.  
            <br>Because he doesn't use short events, there's no need to segment by the event/device number.  
            It also avoids the whole task of having to teach any producer events, 
            just using what comes from the modules by default. 
            </p>
            
            

            <h4>Event Polarity</h4>
            
            <p>You can invert the polarity of ON and OFF events</p>
      <ul>
      <li>on the initial producer module </li>
      <li>Hardware naming format when entered as a JMRI sensor, turnout or light</li>
      <li>Sensor or turnout settings within JMRI</li>
      </ul>

        <h4>Start of Day Events</h4>
        
        <p>When JMRI is started, it doesn't presume that all sensors, turnouts and 
        lights are active or inactive, they have an unknown status.</p>
        
        <p> The vast majority of MERG module kits can send the current status of their 
        inputs or outputs in response to a SOD event taught to that module.</p>
        
        <p>JMRI can store cross-session information such as Memory Variables and 
        Block Values ( Train Describer value )</p>      
        
        <p>When JMRI loads a panel, and the Track Power is on, block values from 
        the previous session are loaded if the block is active.</p>
        
        <p>It may make sense to set Track Power to Off on JMRI Startup and when a panel loads, 
        switching the track power on after the panel has fully loaded.</p>
      
      <h4><a name="automatic" id="automatic">Sensors - JMRI Automatic Creation</a></h4>

        <p>JMRI DOES NOT attempt to create Sensor objects from
        the traffic that it hears on the MERG CBUS network, 
        unlike some other hardware systems.</p>
        
        <p>This is because MERG CBUS is essentially a networking protocol, 
        not a sensor generator.
        Events are not intrinsically associated with
        specific hardware objects, people can use events in many ways.</p>
        
        <p>You can request the status of a sensor by clicking Query in the sensor table. </p>
      
       <h4><a name="turnout" id="turnout">Turnout Operation</a></h4>
      
      <p>MERG CBUS is setup in JMRI for 4 types of turnout ( output ) feedback.</p>
      <p>Turnouts have 2 states, the commanded state, and the Feedback state 
      which is used on panel displays and elsewhere.</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Direct - When the commanded state is changed, 
      the feedback state will reflect the commanded state.</li>
      <li>Delayed - When the commanded state is changed, 
      the feedback state will reflect the commanded state following a brief delay.</li>
      <li>1 Sensor - When the commanded state is changed, the feedback state will not change.
      <br>The feedback state will change when the sensor attached changes state ( eg. Single microswitch events )</li>
      <li>2 Sensor - When the commanded state is changed, the feedback state will not change.
      <br>Feedback state will change when the 2 sensors agree on state ( eg. servo end travel events )</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>You can request the status of a turnout by clicking Query in the turnout table. </p>
      <p>If a turnout uses 1 or 2 sensor feedback, these sensor statuses will also be requested.</p>
      
      <p>See <a href="../../../doc/Technical/TurnoutFeedback.shtml">JMRI : Turnout Feedback</a> for more info.</p>
      
      
      <h4><a name="reporters" id="reporters">Reporter ( incl. RFID ) data from CBUS</a></h4>
      <p><a href="../../../tools/Reporters.shtml">JMRI Reporters</a> do not have Off or On events,
        they just use a device ( short event ) or node number.</p>
        
        <p>Reporters are created by clicking the New button within the 
        <a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ReporterTable.shtml">Reporter Table</a>.</p>
        <p>You can create multiple reporters by checking the Add Sequential Range option.</p>
        
        <p>Like Turnouts Sensors and Lights, these are not created automatically in CBUS.</p>
        
      <p>A typical system name for a reporter would be 
        <code>MR123</code> or <code>MR1234</code> ( no event On or Off ) .</p>
      <p>The DDES and ACDAT OPC's are used for reporter data.</p>
      <p>When an incoming DDES or ACDAT OPC is heard on the network, 
        JMRI will look for a reporter matching the device or node number in the Reporter Table.</p>
      
      <p>If a reporter exists, the <a href="../../../tools/IdTags.shtml">ID tag</a> 
        within the 5 data bytes will be looked up from the 
      <a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/IdTagTable.shtml">ID Tag table</a>.</p>
      
      <p>If there's no matching ID Tag on the table, one will be created and updated.</p>
      
      <p>If the ID tag was previously active for another reporter, 
        the previous reporter will have the tag removed from its report.</p>
      
      <p>Valid reporter numbers are minimum 0, to maximum 65535.</p>
      <p>The DDES ( device number data ) and ACDAT ( node data ) messages are 
        currently handled in exactly the same way, ie the first 2 bytes are used as the Reporter identifier.</p>
      <p>This means that a reporter created via a number of 77 will respond to 
        both DDES device 77 and ACDAT of node 77.</p>
      
      <p>Reporters are saved in your main panel file, along with turnouts and sensors etc.</p>
      <p>ID Tags cross-session automatically, no saving is necessary.</p>

      <h2><a name="sysname" id="sysname">System Names</a></h2>

        <p><strong>This really is all you need to know to get started</strong>, the rest of the information on this page 
        is aimed at advanced use cases, debugging panel xml files, and system development.</p>
      
        <p>JMRI internally associates MERG CBUS events with individual JMRI objects
        (Sensors, Turnouts, Lights, etc.) via the <a href="../../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">JMRI System Names</a>.
        </p>        

        <p>Depending on which MERG CBUS event IDs are used on a
        particular layout, these system names can get very long, in
        which case the "user names" are much more useful.</p>
        
        <p>The 1st letter of a sensor, turnout or light system name is the JMRI system
        letter, generally "M" for MERG connections.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><a href="../../../tools/Sensors.shtml">JMRI sensors</a> use the type letter "S", 
        e.g. <code>MS+123;-345</code>" defines a

        <p>65,536 nodes and 65,535 events gives approx 4,294,901,760 event combinations.</p>
        
        <p>65,535 is unrealistic for events within a node but does allow for useful segmentation of event ranges.</p>
        <p>MERG module kits can use the whole CBUS range of event numbers, on a reset startup operating in SLiM short event mode.
        <br>A MERG CANLED kit can support up to 255 taught events</p>

       </div>

      <h2><a name="namingspec" id="namingspec">Event Naming Specification</a></h2>
      <div>
      <p>A Sensor is defined by two
      events: The one that sets it ACTIVE, and the one that sets it
      INACTIVE. 
      <br>If these are mapped to ON and OFF frames with the
      same event ID number, respectively, only the event ID number
      need be specified:<br>
      <code>MS18</code> 
      The number is decimal.</p>

      <p>To increase versatility, it's possible to use different
      event ID numbers for the ACTIVE transition (by default, an ON
      frame) and INACTIVE transition (by default, an OFF
      frame):<br>
      <code>MS18;21</code></p>

      <p>The ON and OFF coding of MERG CBUS is not entirely consistent
      with the event model, 
      <br>it may be useful to connect the
      ACTIVE or INACTIVE transition of a JMRI Sensor to an OFF or
      ON MERG CBUS frame respectively. 
      <br>Leading "+" and "-" characters
      can do this. For example,<br>
      <code>MS-18;+21</code><br>
      defines a sensor that goes ACTIVE when an OFF frame with ID
      number 18 is received,
      <br>and goes INACTIVE when an ON frame
      with ID number 21 is received.</p>

      <p>MERG CBUS event numbers (usually) contain a node number in
      their most-significant bytes. 
      <br>You can specify the node number
      either by using a full 5 decimal digits for the event number
      itself, preceded by the node number:<br>
      <code>MS200018</code><br>
      or by using the letters "N" and "E" to specify the separate
      parts:<br>
      <code>MSN2E18</code><br></p>

      <p>You can mask off part of the MERG CBUS packet, so any values in
      the masked part will still match, using the "M" format
      letter.<br>
      <code>MS200018M07</code><br>
      "M" indicates the start of a hexadecimal mask that will be
      applied, where 1 bits in the mask will be zero bits in the
      resulting value.
      
      <br>In the example above, "18" through "1F" will
      match. 
      <br>This is particularly useful for matching e.g. MERG CBUS
      short events, where parts of the packet include the node
      number which should (usually) be ignored.</p>
      
      </div>

    <h2><a name="hex" id="hex">Sending hex strings</a></h2>
     <div>
      
      <p>Hexadcimal numbering is based on the power of 16, using 0-9, then A-F.</p>
      
      <p>MERG CBUS modules
      communicate by messages with a fixed format: One byte of
      command and length information, followed optionally by
      additional data bytes.</p>

      <p>In it's most simple form, this is used
      to send identifiable "events". In turn, events come in two
      types: "ON" and "OFF", with two forms, short ( SLiM ), and long ( FiLM ).</p>
      
      <p>These are actually sent across a MERG CBUS network in the form of an Opscode, the command information.</p>
      
      <p>There are 255 ops codes, the length of the data string following the Opscode changes depending on which Opscode is used.</p>
      
      <p>There are multiple Opscodes for events, Controlling and programming DCC devices, DCC consisting, Programming nodes with Node Variables, Programming nodes with events, Fast clock and temperature information, RfID reader data, and many more.</p>
      
      <p>Four of these are the common Opscodes for events :</p>

      CAN frames by specifying their data content as a hex string,
      indicated by "X".</p>
      
      <p>This allows a Sensor or Turnout to disregard any intrinsic meaning to
      "ON" and "OFF" events, and allows it to respond to, or emit any frame

      <p>Ensure you use the right opscode, eg if you include Nodes for a FiLM address, use ACON instead of ASON.</p>
      
      <p>Sensors, Turnouts and Lights stored as Hex response events using the long and short 
      response OPCs will not be recognised as these are translated to standard on and off events 
      just before the ( sensor turnout or light ) internal message match check.
      <br>
      Apart from these specific OPCs, Sensors Turnouts or Lights can store any hex combination, 
      they need both an on and off side seperated by a ";".
      </p>
      
      <p>The CAN frames can send MERG CBUS opscodes in the hex form of the code you require.
      <br>
      eg, to set up a sensor to send ( DCC emergency stop / Track power on ) opscodes over MERG CBUS, 
      <br>you could use a hardware address of <code>X0A;X05</code>

      <p>
      All of these Opscode messages are sent with the Standard CAN event frame, 
      however the protocol also allows for access to extended CAN frames.
      <br>These frames enable bootloading of modules ( firmware updates ), 
      while future uses of this may also be for local media streaming ( eg. transferring 
      pictures of trains or sound files between modules. )
      <br>The extended frames do not interfere with the standard frames, 
      hence modules can be targetted for boatloading by module number, 
      without affecting normal layout messaging.</p>
      
      <p>Extended CAN frames ( which are not CBUS messages ) can be monitored in the 
      <a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/swing/console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml"
        >CBUS console</a>,
        and are filtered from all other JMRI objects ( Sensors, Turnouts etc. ).</p>
      
      <p>Although module firmware updates are not currently available within JMRI, 
      full support for this is available via 3rd party software ( FCU - FLiM Configuration Utility ), 
      available free for MERG members to download.
