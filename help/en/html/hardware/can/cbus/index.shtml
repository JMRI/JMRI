      <h2><a name="documentation" id="documentation">JMRI Documentation</a></h2>
      
      <p>As support for MERG CBUS continues to evolve, 
      this is not a definitive CBUS network guide.
      Although a stable platform, the JMRI documentation  
      might be ahead or behind the actual code.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The latest developers guide and full specification for CBUS is held on a 
      puclic wiki hosted by MERG, follow the link right 
      at the bottom of the <a href="https://www.merg.org.uk/merg_resources/cbus.php">MERG CBUS entry page</a> for complete CBUS documentation.

      <h3>Typical first-time Connection Steps</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Many Modern Operating Systems do not require device drivers to be installed when connecting a CANUSB4.
      <br>
      Plug in, and after being recognised they just work :-) </li>
      <li>Install JMRI</li>
      <li><a href="Details.shtml">Connection Preferences</a> - Select MERG connection, set options as appropriate, use "CAN via MERG CAN-RS or CAN-USB" for a CANUSB4, generally no need to diverge from defaults.</li>
      <li>Save / Restart JMRI</li>
      <li>If you are using DCC over the MERG connection, check that JMRI Preferences > Defaults are set correctly, though leave consisting set to internal, see <a href="#dcc">DCC over CBUS</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Restart JMRI a few times, checking that the default connection preferences have stuck.
      </li>
      <li>A new menu item MERG appears in the PanelPro or DecoderPro window, containing the MERG tools.
      <br>
      Open the tools up and have a play.</li>
      <li>Test CBUS events can be sent from the MERG <a href=
        "../../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/swing/console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml">Send CAN Frame tool</a>.  
      <br>
      Set the test event, eg Frame packets "+1" and / or "-2" ( without the quotation marks ), then waiting 1,000 msec and click Start Sending to generate some steady cbus network traffic.
      <br>
      Check that these events are actually being sent over the CBUS network by using a CBUS module such as a CANACT.</li>
      <li>Use an external producer module to test connectivity receiving events, confirming they appear in the <a href=
        "../../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/swing/console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml">MERG CBUS console</a>.
      </li>
      </ul>

      
      <h2><a name="cbusevents" id="cbusevents">CBUS Events</a></h2>
      
      
      <p>An overview of CBUS Event and object names are described
      below, see full Naming details on <a href=
      "Names.shtml">this page</a>.</p>      
      <p>CBUS modules can be thought of as </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Consumers eg. a CANSOL solenoid module listening on the CANBUS for 
      a taught event to throw a turnout</li>
      <li>Producers, eg. a  CANACE3 Control Panel Switch sensing module,
      sending a CBUS event when a physical control panel button is 
      pressed or a toggle switch changed ( multiplexing allows 128 
      switches on 1 module)</li>
      <li>Or both, eg a CANMIO Servo module listening for taught 
      CBUS events to change turnout positions, then sending its own 
      events on servo start moving, servo mid-point, also sending an 
      event when completing moving the servo to its final position.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>CBUS events are transmitted as a one-to-many network, consumer modules receive all network data then choose whether or not to act on them.
      <br>This enables multiple interfaces to act on a single event, eg : </p>
      <ul>
      <li>A physical turnout( UK - point ) microswitch sensor wired to a CBUS producer module sends a CBUS ON event when thrown.</li>
      <li>This event is received by a relay driver ( consumer ), which changes the frog polarity.</li>
      <li>The event is also received by an LED module ( consumer ), switching an LED on or off on a control panel.</li>
      <li>The event is also received by JMRI ( acting as a consumer ), which checks for any bounce or debounce actions associated with that sensor event, or associated logix.</li>
      <li>JMRI recognises that the sensor is linked to a particular turnout then updates JMRI PanelPro Panels,
        this may start a chain of signal changes and further events.
      </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>JMRI can be used to de-bounce sensors by receiving the event, selecting debounce or logix options, and then sending a turnout output event. This is best done, however, as close to the source of the event creation as possible, ideally on or before the producer module.</p>
      
      
      <p>CBUS events can be short events, eg <code>7</code> for event 7 off and on.</p>
      <p>You can also use long events which generally specify which node they are from, eg event 7 sent on and off from node 2 : <code>+N2E7;-N2E7</code> . </p>
      <p>Short events appear in the MERG CBUS Console with a node number of 0.</p>
      <p>Some modules may only broadcast their events via Long Events, no short event option.</p>
      <p>JMRI, being both a consumer and producer, can send and receive on any node number and any event, however it would be good for you to determine a suitable convetion, then stick with it.</p>
      <p>Node numbers are for CBUS long events, CAN ID's are purely for the CAN protocol transmission and are irrelevant in JMRI processing CBUS events.</p>
      
      
    <h3>Sensors, Turnouts and Lights</h3>
    
    
      <p>CBUS events are stored within JMRI via
      <a href="../../../tools/Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a> ( inputs to JMRI, both on or off ), <a href=
      "../../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnouts</a> ( general purpose JMRI on or off outputs ) and <a href=
      "../../../tools/Lights.shtml">Lights</a> ( JMRI outputs ).</p>


        
        
        <p>The 1st letter of a sensor, turnout or light system name is the <a href="../../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">system
        letter</a>, generally "M" for MERG connections.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>JMRI associates CBUS events with individual JMRI objects
        (Sensors, Turnouts, Lights, etc.) via the JMRI System Names.
        </p>
        
        <p>The system name ( M ), and event type ( S, T or L ) are added automatically when creating a new table entry.</p>

        <p>Depending on which CBUS event IDs are used on a
        particular layout, these system names can get very long, in
        which case the "user names" become much more useful.</p>
        
       <h4>Sensors</h4>
      
      
        <p>CBUS messages coming into JMRI applications can be
        accessed via JMRI Sensor objects. The Sensor's <a href=
        "Names.shtml">System Name</a> determines which CBUS
        message(s) it corresponds to.</p>
      
        <p>A System Name like "<code>MS+123;-345</code>" defines a
        Sensor that follows the "123 ON" and "345 OFF" CBUS short events to
        change state. </p>
        
        
       <h4>Turnouts</h4>
        <p>JMRI is emitting the CBUS frames instead of
        receiving them, and the type letter is "T" instead of "S",
        e.g. <code>MT-18;+21</code>)
        </p>


      <h4>Lights</h4>
        <p>The scheme is similar to Turnouts
        above, except the type letter is "L" instead of "T", e.g.
        <code>ML-18;+21</code>)</p>
      


      <h3>Adding an item to a table</h3>
      <p>When you add an item to one of the tables, many times you only
      have to fill in the numbers to have JMRI construct
      the complete system name.</p>

      
      <p>Here's a few examples :</p>

      
      
      
      <table border="1">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
          
          <th>Entry</th>
          <th>Meaning</th>
          <th>Table Added to</th>
          <th>Makes System Name</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          
          <td>18</td>
          <td>event 18 On; 18 Off</td>
          <td>Turnout</td>
          <td>MT18</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>18;21</td>
          <td>event 18 On; 21 On</td>
          <td>Sensor</td>
          <td>MS18;21</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+18;-21</td>
          <td>event 18 On; 21 Off</td>
          <td>Turnout</td>
          <td>MT+18;-21</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+N2E18;-N2E18</td>
          <td>Node 2 Event 18; On Event = Active; Off Event = Inactive</td>
          <td>Sensor</td>
          <td>MS+N2E18;-N2E18</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody></table>

      <h4>Automatic Creation of Sensors</h4>

      <p>JMRI automatically attempts to create Sensor objects from
      the traffic that it hears on the CBUS.</p>
      <p>When JMRI hears an ON
      or OFF event on the CBUS, it creates a Sensor using the
      corresponding event ID.</p>
      <p>This automatically-created sensor
      defaults to the ON event setting the Sensor ACTIVE and the
      OFF event setting INACTIVE.</p>

      <p>Because events are not intrinsically associated with
      specific hardware objects, and because people can use event
      IDs in many ways, this doesn't do what's desired.</p>
      <p>When it
      doesn't, you can manually create the proper Sensors using the
      <a href=
      "../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorAddEdit.shtml">
      Add...</a> button on the <a href=
      "../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor
      Table</a>.</p>

      <p>Note that there's a <a href=
      "../../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/swing/configtool/ConfigToolFrame.shtml">
      CBUS Event Capture Tool</a> that can help you create Turnouts
      and Sensor names without having to directly work out the
      System Names.</p>

      <h3>Connecting a MERG DCC Command Station CANCMD</h3>
      
        <p>Make sure that main JMRI Preferences > Defaults are set to your MERG connection for Throttles, Power Control, Command Station, Service Programmer and Ops Mode Programmer.</p>
      
        <p>You can use an existing DCC command station, or have a separate DCC command station for a programming track by setting these options.</p>
        <p>Consisting is currently unsupported in MERG connections within JMRI, ensure set to internal.</p>
        <p>More info on what these options do can be found in <a href="../../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Defaults">JMRI preferences help</a>
        </p>
      
        <p>Events do not need to be set up to connect a MERG DCC Command Station CANCMD.</p>
        <p>JMRI will send the DCC events over the CBUS network and can be monitored within the MERG CBUS console</p>
        
        <p>DCC Accessory Decoders can be controlled via a CANCMD by creating turnouts with explicit RDCCx commands, as discussed in <a href="Names.shtml#hex">CBUS event naming</a>.
        <br>
        Examples of this are within the <a href="https://www.merg.org.uk/merg_resources/cbus.php">MERG hosted CBUS public WIKI</a> documentation.</p>
        
        <p>DCC is not a requirement for CBUS or JMRI, many DC layouts use CBUS + JMRI for signalling purposes.
        <br>Adding CBUS / JMRI to an existing DC layout is a good advisory route and may ease the learning curve of getting used to DCC at the same time!</p>


    <h2><a id="signalling" name="signalling">Signalling</a></h2>
      
      <p>There are multiple ways to interface JMRI signalling with CBUS modules.</p>
      <p>You are strongly advised to let JMRI control your signal logic, however linking JMRI with 3rd party signalling over cbus is also discussed.</p>
      
      <h4>JMRI Controlled Signal Logic</h4>
      
      <p>There are multiple ways of sending cbus events from JMRI out to LED or servo signal control modules, this is just one approach.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Add all aspects to the signal in question to the Turnout Table, eg
        <br>Signal1Red : Hardware address : +N126E412 ( Set Node to whatever your JMRI node is )
        <br>Signal1Flashing Precautionary : Hardware address : +N126E416 
        <br>Signals which can only display 2 aspects ( eg a Servo controlling a semaphore signal ) can be setup with 1 cbus event, using the ON and OFF status, eg Signal5RedGreen : +N126E418;-N126E418 etc.      
      </li>
      
      <li>It's also worth creating an internal turnout named something like DummySignalOutput.
      <br>You can use this output for signals which have not yet been installed with CAN events but may have in future.
      </li>


      <li>Add the Signal Mast via the Signal Mast Table</li>
      <li>Specify type : Turnout Controlled</li>
      <li>Specify which turnout ( aka CBUS message output ) you wish to show to show for each aspect, eg. Signal1Red Thrown.
      </li>
      
     <li> 
     For virtual signal masts which are not yet physically installed on your layout, use the DummySignalOutput internal turnout created earlier.
     </li>
    </ul>

      <p>With this approach, you can easily add and edit which CBUS events are sent from a JMRI controlled signal without editing or re-creating the underlying signal logic.</p>
      <p>It also ensures that only 1 cbus messages is sent for flashing aspects, specify this flashing in the module board, not JMRI!  Some Signal Mast types send 1 cbus message for each flash. </p>
      <p>A layout with 20 quad aspect signals could send 40 odd cbus events every 0.5seconds, 4,800 events per minute.  This could make network diagnosis awkward, although very unlikely to swamp a CBUS network.</p>
      <p>As stated previously, this is just one approach. There are may ways of interfacing JMRI with CBUS signalling systems.</p>
      
      
      <h4>Receiving Module supplied or existing Signal Logic into JMRI</h4>
      <p>This is normally done the other way round, however people may have existing systems in place which they do not want to change.</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Create a virtual Signal Mast, named something like SignalMast7</li>
      <li>Create incoming CBUS event(s) as sensor(s), eg "SignalMast7Red".</li>
      <li>For each signal state ( eg. Stop or Proceed ), create a JMRI LOGIX to set the signal head or mast as appropriate, similar to
      <br>
      If SignalMast7Red is active, set SignalMast7 to Stop
      </li>
      <li>Repeat for each signal state</li>
      </ul>

        <br>
        Classic and 2G modules can both be on the same cbus network with an element of care, seek further advice if in any doubt, do not guess!
