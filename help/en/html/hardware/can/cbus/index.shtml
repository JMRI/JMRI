<h1> 
JMRI: CBUS Support
</h1>

<em>The support on this page is rapidly evolving; the
actual code might be ahead or behind the documentation
on any given day.</em><p>

JMRI provides support for general JMRI
<a href="../../../tools/Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a>
and
<a href="../../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnouts</a>
in terms of CBUS "events". 

<p>
See also the 
<a href="../index.shtml">main help page</a> for JMRI CAN support,
including links to various general tools.

<h2>Naming</h2>

The <a href="../../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">system letter</a> 
for CBUS connections is "M". Details of CBus 
event and object names are 
described below, with technical details on a
<a href="Names.shtml">separate page</a>.

<h2>Sensors</h2>

CBUS messages coming into JMRI applications can be accessed 
via JMRI Sensor objects.  The Sensor's 
<a href="">system name</a>
determines which CBUS message(s) it corresponds to.

<h3>Naming</h3>
A sensor is defined by two events: The one that sets it ACTIVE, and
the one that sets it INACTIVE.

If these are mapped to ON and OFF frames with the same event ID number, respectively,
only the event ID number need be specified:
<br><code>MS18</code><br>
The number is decimal.

<p>
To increase versatility, it's possible to use different event ID numbers
for the ACTIVE transition (by default, an ON frame) and INACTIVE
transition (by default, an OFF frame):
<br><code>MS18;21</code>

<p>
The ON and OFF coding of CBUS is not entirely consistent with the event
model, and it may be useful to connect the ACTIVE or INACTIVE 
transition of a JMRI Sensor to an OFF or ON CBUS frame respectively.
Leading "+" and "-" characters can do this. For example,
<br><code>MS-18;+21</code><br>
defines a sensor that goes ACTIVE when an OFF frame with ID number 18 is received,
and goes INACTIVE when an ON frame with ID number 21 is received.

<p>
Finally, it's possible to connect a Sensor to 
arbitrary can frames by specifying their data content
as a hex string:
<br><code>MSx9100000000000012;x9100000000000019</code><br>

This allows the Sensor to disregard any intrinsic meaning to "ON" and "OFF"
events, and allows it to respond to any frame on the layout.

<h3>Automatic Creation</h3>

JMRI automatically attempts to create Sensor objects from the 
traffic that it hears on the CBUS.  
<p>
When JMRI hears an ON or OFF event on the CBUS, it creates a Sensor
using the corresponding event ID.  
This automatically-created sensor defaults to 
the ON event setting the Sensor ACTIVE 
and the OFF event setting INACTIVE.

<p>
Because events are not intrinsically associate with specific hardware
objects, and because people can use event IDs in many ways, this
doesn't do what's desired.  When it doesn't, you can manually
create the proper Sensors using the 
<a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
button on the
<a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor Table</a>.

<p>

<h2>Turnouts</h2>

(To be written, but the scheme is similar to Sensors above, 
except JMRI is emitting the CBUS frames instead of receiving them, and
the type letter is "T" instead of "S", e.g. <code>MT-18;+21</code>)
