                    <p>Originally named CBUS by co-founder Gil Fuchs, CBUS is an 'open' protocol for Model Railway
                        use. The protocol and other useful information is hosted on the MERG public website 
                        (see further support links). CBUS is not owned or controlled by MERG but the co-founders 
                        Gil Fuchs and Mike Bolton are active members. MERG members are able to purchase a range 
                        of CBUS kits.</p>

                    <p>As support for CBUS continues to evolve, these help pages are not a definitive CBUS network guide
                        and contain considerable simplification of the CBUS scheme. They are aimed at helping new users 
                        to JMRI or CBUS, not systems developers who should consult the full protocol specification and
                        Developer's Guide hosted by MERG.</p>

                    <h3>CBUS Event Overview </h3>

                    <p>CBUS events are transmitted as a one-to-many network. Connected modules receive all network messages and 
                        choose whether or not to act on them. This enables multiple modules to act on a single event, eg: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A physical turnout (UK - point) sensor is wired to a CBUS <b>producer</b> module. The module has been 
                            taught to send a particular event when the switch is closed.</li>
                        <li>This event is received by a relay driver (<b>consumer</b>), which changes the frog polarity.</li>
                        <li>The event is also received by an LED module (<b>consumer</b>) which has not been taught the event, so does nothing.</li>
                        <li>The event is also received by an LED module (<b>consumer</b>), lighting a LED on a mimic panel.</li>
                        <li>The event is also received by JMRI (<b>consumer</b>)
                        <li>A <a href="../../../tools/Sensors.shtml">JMRI sensor</a> has been created with the event number, 
                            causing the sensor status to change
                            <ul>

                            mapping is checked and the relevant CBUS event is sent to change 
                            that on the layout (<b>producer</b>)</li>
                        <li>This event is received by a module which changes a physical on-layout signal (<b>consumer</b>) </li>
                        <li>This event is also received by a module which changes a signal 
                            on a mimic panel (<b>consumer</b>)</li>

                        <li>A train, controlled by (<a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"

                            has cleared and can increase its speed.</li>
                        <li>DCC commands are generated from JMRI and sent over CBUS using 
                            special events (<b>producer</b>) </li>

                        <li>These CBUS events are received by a <b>consumer</b>, e.g. a DCC command station, 
                            which then sends the actual DCC command.
                            <br>

                            <br>This train had requested the section ahead of it, JMRI Dispactcher/Warrants 
                            had allocated it (after checking occupancy and other rules), 
                            then sent the turnout event (<b>producer</b>) to change the points.
                            <br>The event was received by a Servo or solenoid module (<b>consumer</b>) 
                            which had triggered correctly, changing the point sensor right at the top of this example.
                        </li>

                        <li>You can start small and think big, adding more modules as your time and experience allows.

                            <br>Many people use CBUS and JMRI purely for displaying turnout positions, 
                            adding things like track occupancy, on-layout signals, mimic panels etc. at a later date.

                            <br>If you anticipate adding track occupancy, 
                            especially track circuit electrical block (Train On Track Indicators),
                            ideally plan the electrical scheme for this on your layout at any early stage.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>CBUS events generally come in two types: "ON" and "OFF".</p>

                    <p>Events can be short (SLiM) events, eg <code>+11</code> for event 11 on.</p>

                    <p>Events can be long (FLiM) events, eg <code>-N2E7</code> for node 2 event 7 off.</p>

                    <p>JMRI, being both a <b>consumer</b> and <b>producer</b> of events, 
                        can send and receive on any node number and any event.</p>

                <h2><a name="dcc" id="dcc">DCC over CBUS</a></h2>
                <div>
                    <p>DCC is not a requirement for CBUS or JMRI. Many DC layouts use 
                        CBUS + JMRI for route setting, signalling and track occupancy purposes.</p>

                    <p>For full details of using CBUS in a DCC system you should refer to the JMRI help pages,
                        or other documentation, for your chosen manufacturer's hardware. Some brief details
                        are included below.</p>

                    <p>JMRI will send and receive CBUS encoded DCC packets over the CBUS network. These
                        and can be monitored with the CBUS console</p>

                    <p>Loco sessions are best viewed with the 
                        <a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/swing/cbusslotmonitor/CbusSlotMonitorPane.shtml" 
                           >CBUS Command Station Monitor</a>, which displays the sessions in a table format.</p>

                    <h3>Throttles</h3>

                    <p>All of the programs within the JMRI suite (including the JMRI WiThrottle server)
                        internally share the same command station slot for a given loco address,
                        so all of JMRI appears to the command station as a single throttle for any single address.</p>

                    <p>JMRI (via the CBUS Node Manager) can tell if a command station is available which 
                        supports the CBUS steal or share features, when throttles are requested which are already in use 
                        by something external to JMRI (i.e. a CBUS connected throttle).</p>

                    <p>When a JMRI application requests a loco (which is already in a CBUS session), 
                        JMRI will check the main <a 
                            href="../../../tools/throttle/ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">Throttles Preferences</a>.</p>

                    <p>If Silent Steal or Silent Share has been selected, this will be the default action.</p>

                    <p>If neither have been checked and you are using the main JMRI Throttle, you will be asked
                        if you want to Steal, Share, or cancel.</p>

                    <img src="images/web/cbus-throttle-steal-share-dialogue-322x128.png"
                         width="322" height="128" alt="JMRI CBUS Steal Share Dialogue">

                    <p>If you are using an automation script and neither option is checked, the system will
                        attempt to acquire a Share on the session.</p>

                    <p>The command station may disable or enable steal / share at any point, 
                        so even if you have a preferred option, an automation script may attempt to use
                        the non-preferred option to obtain the session.</p>

                    <h4>Throttles Stolen from JMRI</h4>

                    <p>When a Throttle session has been stolen / cancelled from outside of JMRI, 
                        any open JMRI throttle window for that loco
                        will cease to accept commands, ie throttle slider and function keys greyed out.</p>

                    <p>If Silent Share is enabled in the Throttle Preferences, 
                        and share is available on the Command Station,
                        after a short delay JMRI will attempt to share the throttle.</p>

                    <p>For most users, silent sharing enables most layouts to operate with minimum of fuss.</p>

                    <p>If Silent Steal is enabled in the Throttle Preferences, 
                        and steal is available on the Command Station,
                        after a short delay JMRI will attempt to steal the throttle back.</p>

                    <p>Beware of creating Steal loops if more than 1 throttle is capable of auto-stealback!
                        If you find this is happening, disable the Silent Stealing option to stop the loop.</p>

                    <p>If neither option is enabled, or the steal / share is not possible, a notification will be displayed:</p>

                    <img src="images/web/cbus-throttle-stolen-dialogue-278x138.png"
                         width="278" height="138" alt="JMRI CBUS Stolen Throttle Dialogue">

                    <p>Ticking the checkbox before closing the popup will suppress loco steal notifications for
                        the rest of the JMRI session, for all loco sessions.</p>

                    <p>Relevant information can be viewed in the main JMRI Console log.</p>

                    <p>Note that not all JMRI applications currently have a method for dealing with a stolen throttle.</p>

                    <h4>Dispatch / Release</h4>
                    <p>Dispatch is available according to Command Station features.</p>
                    <p>Note that as dispatch availability for a single loco address may change, 
                        this will be reflected by button availability in the main JMRI Throttle.</p>

                    <h3>Consisting</h3>
                    <p>Support for consisting depends on features of the connected hardware.</p>

                    <p>Although the CBUS protocol supports Advanced Consisting, 
                        this has not been implemented within JMRI at present.</p>

                    <p><a href="../../../../html/tools/consisttool/ConsistTool.shtml" 
                          title="JMRI Consisting">JMRI Consisting</a> 
                        : Advanced Decoder Consisting (Decoder Assisted Consist) is currently unsupported,
                        hence this is set to Internal in the CBUS preferences.</p>

                    <p>Primary Address Consists are supported however.</p>

                    <p>Subject to support in the connected hardware, a CBUS connection fully supports programming

                <div>
                    <p>There are multiple ways to interface 
                        <a href="../../../../html/tools/signaling/index.shtml">JMRI signalling</a> with CBUS modules.</p>
                    <p>You are strongly advised to let JMRI control your signal logic, 
                        however it's also possible to link JMRI with 3rd party signalling over CBUS.</p>

                    <p>JMRI includes various signalling definitions, a popular choice for UK based layouts being  
                        <a href="../../../../../../xml/signals/BR-2003/index.shtml">BR2003</a>, however 
                        for some layouts <a href="../../../../../../xml/signals/LMS-1932/index.shtml">LMS 1932</a> or <a 
                            href="../../../../../../xml/signals/GWR-1931/index.shtml">GWR 1931</a> may be more appropriate.</p>

                    <h3>Sending JMRI Controlled Signal Logic to your layout</h3>

                    <img src="images/web/signal-mast-turnout-contolled-400x454.png"
                         width="400" height="454" alt="JMRI signal mast turnout controlled" align= "right">


                    <p>There are multiple ways of sending cbus events from JMRI out to LED or servo 
                        signal control modules, this is just one approach. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Add all aspects to the signal in question to the Turnout Table.
                            <br>eg. Signal 1 Red : <code>+N256E412</code> (only uses the ON event)
                            <br>eg. Signal 1 Flashing Precautionary : <code>+N256E416</code> (only uses the ON event)
                            <br>Signals which can only display 2 aspects (eg a Servo controlling a semaphore signal) 
                            can be setup with 1 CBUS event, using the standard ON and OFF event status.
                        </li>

                        <li>Add a Signal Mast via the <a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.shtml"
                                                         title="JMRI Signal Mast Table">Signal Mast Table</a></li>
                        <li>Specify type : <a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml#turnoutCtl"
                                              title="Turnout Controlled Signal Mast">Turnout Controlled</a></li>
                        <li>Specify which Turnout output you wish to show to show for each aspect,
                            eg. Signal 1 Red Thrown.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This ensures that only 1 CBUS message is sent for flashing aspects, 
                        specify this flashing in the module board, not JMRI!  
                        Some Signal Mast types send 1 CBUS message for each flash.
                        <br>A layout with 20 quad aspect signals could send 40 odd cbus events every 0.5seconds, 4,800 events per minute. 
                        This could make network diagnosis awkward, although very unlikely to swamp a CBUS network.</p>
                    <p>As stated previously, this is just one approach. 
                        There are other methods of interfacing JMRI with CBUS signalling systems.</p>

                    <p>There is initial support for the experimental CabData OPC available in 
                        <a href="../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/cabsignals/CabSignalPane.shtml"

                    <h3>Receiving Module supplied or existing Signal Logic into JMRI</h3>
                    <p>This is normally done the other way round, however people may have 
                        existing systems in place which they do not want to change.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a virtual Signal Mast, named something like SignalMast7</li>
                        <li>Create incoming CBUS event(s) as sensor(s), eg "SignalMast7Red".</li>
                        <li>For each signal state (eg. Stop or Proceed), 
                            create a new <a href="../../../tools/Logix.shtml">JMRI Logix</a>
