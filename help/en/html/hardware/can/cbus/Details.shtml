      <h1>Hardware Support: CBUS - Technical Details</h1><em>The
      support on this page is rapidly evolving; the actual code
      might be ahead or behind the documentation on any given
      day.</em>

      <p>This page describes technical details of JMRI's <a href=
      "index.shtml">CBUS</a> support.</p>

      <h2>CAN Adapters</h2>JMRI's general approach is to support as
      many hardware combinations as possible. By supporting as many
      people and their hardware desires as possible, we can create
      a growing community of developers, hence more code.

      <p>As part of this, the JMRI CAN support is designed to use
      as many CAN adapter types as possible.</p>

      <p>The MERG CAN-RS can do "enumeration" for CBUS, but many
      other adapters can't because of their intrinsic latency.
      Their slow replies effectively make them invisible.</p>

      <p>Therefore, Mike Bolton , one of the CBUS developers
      suggested that JMRI use a CBUS ID of 126. Currently, that's a
      fixed value. <a name="documentation" id=
