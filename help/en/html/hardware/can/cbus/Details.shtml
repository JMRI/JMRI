<h1>Hardware Support: CBUS - Technical Details</h1>

<em>The support on this page is rapidly evolving; the
actual code might be ahead or behind the documentation
on any given day.</em>
<p>
This page describes technical details of JMRI's
<a href="index.shtml">CBUS</a>
support.

<h2>CAN Adapters</h2>

JMRI's general approach is to support as many 
hardware combinations as possible. By supporting as many 
people and their hardware desires as possible, we 
can create a growing community of developers, hence more
code.

<p>
As part of this, the JMRI CAN support is designed to
use as many CAN adapter types as possible.

<p>
The MERG CAN-RS can do "enumeration" for CBUS, but 
many other adapters can't 
because of their intrinsic latency.
Their slow replies effectively make them invisible.  

<p>
Therefore, Mike Bolton , one of the the CBUS developers
suggested that
JMRI use a CBUS ID of 126.  Currently, that's a fixed value.
