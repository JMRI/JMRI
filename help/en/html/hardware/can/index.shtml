      <p>There's an emerging trend to develop model-railroad
      control systems that are based on standard 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus">CAN</a>
      technology. JMRI provides support for the development and use
      of these. Two systems are described below.</p>

      <h2>CAN Implementations</h2>

      <p>OpenLCB is a group of hobbyists and manufacturers who have

      <p>
      MERG CBUS is an 'open source' or public domain project hosted by the
      Model Electronic Railway Group (<a href=
      "https://www.merg.org.uk/">MERG</a>), following years of 
      development by MERG members Mike Bolton and Gil Fuchs.
      <br >
      Their intention was to develop a system for comprehensive 
      layout control based on a general purpose Layout Control Bus (LCB).
      </p>

      
      <p>They adopted the Gridconnect scheme but with a slight modification. 
      <br>The header is always HEX bytes and maps directly to the PIC CAN registers, left justified.</p>
      
      <p>
      JMRI <a href="cbus/index.shtml">MERG CBUS</a> support is available for linking JMRI with MERG CBUS, aimed at
          users.
      <br>Extensive details of the MERG CBUS protocol are available to developers, see the <a href="cbus/index.shtml#thirdparty">MERG CBUS Wiki</a>.
      
      <p>There are many MERG module kits available to help running a layout.
      <br>
      Modules can be thought of as
      </p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Consumers eg. a CANSOL solenoid module listening on the CANBUS for 
      a taught event to throw a turnout</li>
      <li>Producers, eg. a  CANACE3 Control Panel Switch sensing module,
      sending an event when a physical control panel button is 
      pressed or a toggle switch changed ( multiplexing allows 128 
      switches on 1 module)</li>
      <li>Or both, eg a CANMIO Servo module listening for taught 
      events to change turnout positions, then sending its own 
      events on servo start moving, servo mid-point, also sending an 
      event when completing moving the servo to its final position.</li>
      </ul>      

      <p>
      The 3,000+ MERG members are encouraged to to build and design their 
      own modules, and with MERG being over 50 years old, 
      there is a strong peer review process behind MERG CBUS.
      <br>
      Module firmware updates can be performed over the MERG CBUS network 
      </p>
      
      <p>JMRI includes support for
      <a href="cbus/index.shtml#cbusevents">MERG CBUS events</a>, also <a 
      href="cbus/index.shtml#dcc">DCC 
      over MERG CBUS</a> via a CANCMD kit 
      (a fully featured DCC Command Station, mini booster and
      track programmer). This interfaces to JMRI and / or MERG
      handheld controllers over a MERG CBUS network.
      </p>
      
      <p>MERG CBUS events are sent as one-to-many, enabling multiple modules to listen and change status on 1 single event. eg.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Event sent from a turnout ( UK - point ) switch monitoring module, sending an "off event" when the point is thrown, an "on event" when closed.</li>
        <li>This event is received by a Relay module, switching the frog polarity of the physical point.</li>
        <li>Event also received by a LED module, changing the LEDs on a mimic panel representing the point position.</li>
        <li>Event also received by JMRI to use in Layout Panels et al.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>JMRI can send and receive events for any module node and any module event.</p>

      <p>JMRI can connect to CAN networks in several ways:</p>

      <h3>Via USB</h3>

      <p>To use any of the above adapters, select the appropriate
      device/connection type in the JMRI Preferences. 
      
      If using a
      GridConnect or Lawicel device, be sure to set the appropriate
      baud rate under Advanced Preferences.<br>
      The TCH Technology adapter does this automatically, so no
      setting is required.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      To <a href="cbus/Details.shtml#c1">connect to a CANUSB4</a>, select "MERG" as system manufacturer,
      then "CAN via MERG CAN-RS or CAN-USB" as system connection.
      </p>

      <h3>TCP/IP Network</h3>

      <p>It's also possible to attach via a TCP/IP connection
      (EtherNet or WiFi). This can either go to another JMRI
      instance running e.g. an OpenLCB hub, directly to an
      IP-CAN adapter, or a CAN Server. To configure one of these, open the
      Connections tab in the JMRI Preferences.</p>
      
     <h4>OpenLCB</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Select as System Manufacturer "OpenLCB"</li>

        <li>For System Connection, select "CAN via GridConnect
        Network Interface"</li>

        <li>Under settings, enter the IP address and TCP/UDP port
        for the destination.
          <p>OpenLCB CAN Adapters advertise under mDNS/Bonjour, so
          you can use that to specify the IP address if JMRI is on
          the same network segment as your adapter. In that case,
          put "openlcbcan.local." (note trailing period!) in the IP
          address field.</p>
          <p>The port number for OpenLCB adapters is 23 by
          default.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Set the connection protocol as desired, e.g. "OpenLCB",
        the Connection Prefix (usually "M") and Connection Name as
        needed.</li>
        <li>Click Save, and restart.</li>
      </ul>
      
     <h4>MERG CBUS</h4> 
      <ul>
      <li>Select as system manufacturer MERG.</li>
      <li>For system connection, select CAN via MERG Network Interface</li>
      <li>Under settings, enter the IP address or hostname of the device with
      the physical connection to your MERG CBUS network, eg "192.168.0.5" or "localhost"
      <br>The CANPi has a default IP of 192.168.45.1 .
      </li>
      <li>The TCP port is 5550 ( TCP 5550 is reserved for MERG CBUS use by the IANA ).</li>
      <li>Connection protocol - MERG CBUS</li>
      <li>Connection prefix is normally "M" for MERG CBUS.</li>
      <li>Click Save, and restart.</li>
      </ul>
