<h1> 
JMRI: CAN Network Support
</h1>

There's an emerging trend to develop model-railroad control systems
that are based on standard CAN network technology.  
JMRI provides 
support for the development and use of these.

<p>
Two initial efforts:

<a href="http://www.openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a>
<dd>
OpenLCB is a group of hobbyists and manufacturers who have 
come together to produce a future-oriented layout control bus, also called
<a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a>.
<p>
JMRI includes 
<a href="../openlcb/index.shtml">basic support for OpenLCB</a>, 
and more is being developed along with OpenLCB itself.

<p>
<img src="http://www.nmra.org/common/nmra_logo.jpg" align="right" alt="NMRA logo" height="45" width="55">
The <a href="http://www.nmra.org">NMRA</a> has 
<a href="http://nmranet.org">decided</a> 
to adopt OpenLCB and standardize it under the 
<a href="http://nmranet.org">NMRAnet name</a>.

<dd>
A group of hobbyists, under the umbrella of the Model Electronic Railway Group 
(<a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/">MERG</a>), 
are developing a layout control bus called CBUS.
They are creating 
<a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/resources/lcb.html">extensive documentation</a>.
<p>
JMRI includes 
<a href="cbus/index.shtml">basic support for CBUS</a>, 
and more is being developed along with CBUS itself.

<h2>Capabilities</h2>

JMRI provides a basic 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/AbstractMonFrame.shtml">monitor tool</a> 
for watching traffic on a CAN bus.
<p>
There's also a 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/swing/send/CanSendFrame.shtml">tool for sending</a> CAN frames manually and in 
sequences.
<p>
JMRI can provide the usual Sensor and Turnout features once configured for
<a href="../openlcb/index.shtml">OpenLCB</a> or
<a href="cbus/index.shtml">CBUS</a> "events".

<p>
For development, there are 
<a href="scripting.shtml">scripting tools</a>
for sending and receiving CAN frames.  
These can be very useful in testing hardware, etc.

<h2>Configuring a CAN connection</h2>
<a name="connect"/>
JMRI can connect to CAN networks several ways.  
<p>
There are various CAN-USB adapters available:

<dl>
<dt>TCH Technologies
<dd><a href="http://www.tchtechnology.com/products/can_usb/">TCH Technology CAN/USB</a>
which provides a high-speed connection for model railroad use
<dt>gridconnect
<dd><a href="http://www.gridconnect.com/canboandto.html">GridConnect</a> CAN_RS,
which is also the protocol used by the MERG CAN_RS board
<dt>lawicell
<dd><a href="http://canusb.com/">LAWICEL AB</a> 
CANUSB and CAN232 adapters.
</dl>
To use any of these, select the appropriate device type in the 
JMRI preferences.  If using a GridConnect or Lawicel device, be sure to
set the appropriate baud rate under advanced preferences.  The TCH Technology 
adapter does this automatically, so no setting is required.

<p>
It's also possible to attach via a TCP/IP connection (EtherNet or WiFi).
This can either go to another JMRI instance running e.g. an OpenLCB hub, 
or directly to an IP-CAN adapter. To configure one of these, open the 
preferences and select:
<ul>
<li>Select your system manufacturer, e.g. OpenLCB
<li>For System Connection, select "CAN via GridConnect Network Interface"
<li>Under settings, enter the IP address and TCP/UDP port for the destination.

<p>OpenLCB CAN Adapters advertise under mDNS/Bonjour, so you can use that
to specify the IP address if JMRI is on the same network segment
as your adapter.  In that case, put "openlcbcan.local." (note trailing period!)
in the IP address field.
<p>The port number for OpenLCB adapters is 23 by default.
<li>Set the connection protocol as desired, e.g. "OpenLCB", and the
Connection Prefix (usually "M") and Connection Name as needed.
<li>Click Save, and restart.
</ul>
