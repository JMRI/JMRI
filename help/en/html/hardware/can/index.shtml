      <p>There's an emerging trend to develop model-railroad control systems that are based on
      standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus">CAN</a> technology. JMRI provides
      support for the development and use of these. Two systems are described below.</p>

      <h2>CAN Implementations</h2>

      <h3><a href="../openlcb/index.shtml">OpenLCB</a>

      <p>OpenLCB is a group of hobbyists and manufacturers who have come together to produce a
      future-oriented layout control bus, also called <a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a>.<br>
      JMRI includes <a href="../openlcb/index.shtml">basic support for OpenLCB</a>, and more is
      being developed along with OpenLCB itself.</p>
      <img src="http://www.nmra.org/common/nmra_logo.jpg" class="floatRight" alt="NMRA logo"

      <p>The <a href="http://www.nmra.org">NMRA</a> has <a href=
      "http://www.nmra.org/news/proposed-standard-layout-command-control-lcc-published-comments#">decided</a>
      to adopt OpenLCB and standardize it as <a href=
      "http://www.nmra.org/index-nmra-standards-and-recommended-practices#node-171">Layout Command
      Control (LCC, formerly NMRAnet)</a>.</p>

      <h3><a href="cbus/index.shtml">CBUS®</a>
      </h3>

      <p>Originally named CBUS by co-founder Gil Fuchs, CBUS is an 'open' protocol for Model
      Railway use. The protocol and other useful information is hosted on the MERG public website
      (see further support links). CBUS is not owned or controlled by MERG but the co-founders Gil
      Fuchs and Mike Bolton are active members. MERG members are able to purchase a range of CBUS
      kits.</p>

      <p>CBUS adopted the Gridconnect scheme but with a slight modification.<br>
      The header is always HEX bytes and maps directly to the PIC CAN registers, left
      justified.</p>

      <p>JMRI <a href="cbus/index.shtml">CBUS</a> support is available for linking JMRI with CBUS,
      aimed at users.<br>
      Extensive details of the CBUS protocol are available to developers, see the <a href=
      "cbus/index.shtml#thirdparty">CBUS Wiki</a> hosted on the MERG public website.</p>

      <p>There are many MERG module kits available to help running a layout.<br>
      Modules can be thought of as</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Consumers eg. a CANSOL solenoid module listening on the CANBUS for a taught event to
        throw a turnout</li>

        <li>Producers, eg. a CANACE3 Control Panel Switch sensing module, sending an event when a
        physical control panel button is pressed or a toggle switch changed ( multiplexing allows
        128 switches on 1 module)</li>

        <li>Or both, eg a CANMIO Servo module listening for taught events to change turnout
        positions, then sending its own events on servo start moving, servo mid-point, also sending
        an event when completing moving the servo to its final position.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The 3,000+ MERG members are encouraged to to build and design their own modules, and with
      MERG being over 50 years old, there is a strong peer review process behind CBUS.<br>
      Module firmware updates can be performed over the CBUS network</p>

      <p>JMRI includes support for <a href="cbus/index.shtml#cbusevents">CBUS events</a>, also
      <a href="cbus/index.shtml#dcc">DCC over CBUS</a> via a CANCMD kit (a fully featured DCC
      Command Station, mini booster and track programmer). This interfaces to JMRI and / or MERG
      handheld controllers over a CBUS network.</p>

      <p>CBUS events are sent as one-to-many, enabling multiple modules to listen and change status
      on 1 single event. eg.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Event sent from a turnout ( UK - point ) switch monitoring module, sending an "off
        event" when the point is thrown, an "on event" when closed.</li>

        <li>This event is received by a Relay module, switching the frog polarity of the physical
        point.</li>

        <li>Event also received by a LED module, changing the LEDs on a mimic panel representing
        the point position.</li>

        <li>Event also received by JMRI to use in Layout Panels et al.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>JMRI can send and receive events for any module node and any module event.</p>

      <p>Example System Naming:</p>

      <p>JMRI can connect to CAN networks in several ways:</p>

      <h3>Via USB</h3>

      <p>To use any of the above adapters, select the appropriate device/connection type in the
      JMRI Preferences. If using a GridConnect or Lawicel device, be sure to set the appropriate
      baud rate under Advanced Preferences.<br>
      The TCH Technology adapter does this automatically, so no setting is required.</p>

      <p>To connect to a CANUSB4, select "MERG" as system manufacturer, then "CAN via MERG CAN-RS
      or CAN-USB" as system connection.</p>

      <h3>TCP/IP Network</h3>

      <p>It's also possible to attach via a TCP/IP connection (EtherNet or WiFi). This can either
      go to another JMRI instance running e.g. an OpenLCB hub, directly to an IP-CAN adapter, or a
      CAN Server. To configure one of these, open the Connections tab in the JMRI Preferences.</p>

      <h4>OpenLCB</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Select as System Manufacturer "OpenLCB"</li>

        <li>For System Connection, select "CAN via GridConnect Network Interface"</li>

        <li>Under settings, enter the IP address and TCP/UDP port for the destination.
          <p>OpenLCB CAN Adapters advertise under mDNS/Bonjour, so you can use that to specify the
          IP address if JMRI is on the same network segment as your adapter. In that case, put
          "openlcbcan.local." (note trailing period!) in the IP address field.</p>

          <p>The port number for OpenLCB adapters is 23 by default.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Set the connection protocol as desired, e.g. "OpenLCB", the Connection Prefix (usually
        "M") and Connection Name as needed.</li>

        <li>Click Save, and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>MERG via CBUS</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Select as system manufacturer MERG.</li>

        <li>For system connection, select CAN via MERG Network Interface</li>

        <li>Under settings, enter the IP address or hostname of the device with the physical
        connection to your CBUS network, eg "192.168.0.5" or "localhost"<br>
        The CANPi has a default IP of 192.168.45.1 .</li>

        <li>The TCP port is 5550 ( TCP 5550 is reserved for CBUS use by the IANA ).</li>

        <li>Connection protocol - CBUS</li>

        <li>Connection prefix is normally "M" for CBUS.</li>

        <li>Click Save, and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><a href="cbus/index.shtml#thirdparty">CBUS Server</a> is a <a href=
      "https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> program, licensed under MIT to allow multiple network
      connections to a MERG CANUSB4.</p>

      <h2 id="tools">JMRI CAN Tools</h2>
