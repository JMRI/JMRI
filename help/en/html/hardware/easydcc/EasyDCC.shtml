      <h1>Hardware Support: CVP Products EasyDCC</h1><a name="hardware" id=
      "hardware"></a>

      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <h3>Command Station</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>#EDCSK - EasyDCC Kit Command Station</li>

        <li>#EDCSA - EasyDCC Assembled Command Station</li>

        <li>#EDCSB - EasyDCC "board alone" Command Station</li>
      </ul><a name="limitations" id="limitations"></a>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <p>Some older EasyDCC systems may need an update to their
      built in program. This is done by replacing the "PROM" chips in the
      command station with a newer version. Version 207 is known to
      work well, but version 022 is known to have some problems
      communicating with a computer. Later EasyDCC command
      stations will connect OK.</p>

      <a name="connecting" id="connecting"></a>
      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <h3>Wiring</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>To connect your computer to an EasyDCC system, you need
        to connect the Command Station to the computer's serial
        port using a special cable.
        This is not an item that computer stores generally stock, due to the
        special RJ11 connector needed at the command station end of
        the cable. You'll probably have to make this cable
        yourself, or have another CVP user make it for you.

          <p>For more information on how the cable is wired, see
          page 134 of the EasyDCC V4 command station manual or page
          143 of the V6 manual (a <a href=
          "http://www.cvpusa.com/doc_center/r1_CS2B_User_Guide_web.pdf">
          version in PDF</a> is available on the web).</p>

          <p>One easy way to connect the system to your computer is
          to buy a 9-pin serial cable and a phone cable, then cut
          them and splice them together.<br>
          With computers without a dedicated serial port, use a
          USB-to-Serial adapter.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, you can connect your EasyDCC command station
          to your computer running JMRI over a networked
          serial box as (see <a href="#network">below</a>).</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Settings</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Next, go to the Preferences panel of a JMRI-based
        program. This opens automatically the first time a program
        is run, or you can select it from the "Edit" menu.</li>

        <li>Open the <strong>Connections</strong> tab, select "Easy
        DCC" from the System Manufacturer selection box and choose
        from the following setups.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Serial</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Select "EasyDCC via Serial" as the System Connection.
        You can then select the proper serial port from the
        drop-down list under Settings.</li>
        <li>Accept the suggested Connection Prefix and Name,
        or replace it with a more fitting one. Make sure it is unique.</li>
        <li>Under Additional Connection Settings, the baud rate box
        will be fixed at 9,600 baud.</li>
        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the
        program to quit; click "Yes".</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="network" id="network"></a>
      <h4>Network</h4>
      <p>Connect to a networked serial box such as the
      <a href="https://www.lantronix.com/products/eds8pr16pr32pr/">Lantronix
      EDS8PR/16PR/32PR</a> as a virtualized EasyDCC over Serial
      connection in JMRI, as demonstrated by david zuhn.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "EasyDCC via Network" as the System
        Connection.</li>
        <li>Review the suggested Connection Name and prefix.</li>
        <li>Under Settings, enter the IP Address (optional for
        zeroConfig/mDNS) and Port number
        (on Lantronix boxes, the port number is calculated as
        2000 + the physical port number on the back of the box).<br>
        On the Lantronix box, set up the serial communications as described
        above under "Serial".</li>
        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the
        program to quit; click "Yes".</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Simulator</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>If no hardware is attached, select "EasyDCC Simulator"
        as System Connection.</li>
        <li>Review the suggested Connection Name and prefix.</li>
        <li>No other settings are needed.</li>
        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the
        program to quit; click "Yes".</li>
      </ul>

        <p>To complete the configuration, restart JMRI.
        You should now be up and running.<br>
        Notice the EasyDCC menu on the main JMRI screen.</p>
