      <h1>Hardware Support: OpenLCB - Technical Details</h1>
      <em>JMRI support for OpenLCB is rapidly evolving; the actual code might be ahead or behind
      the documentation on any given day.</em>
      <p>This page describes technical details of JMRI's <a href="index.shtml">OpenLCB</a>
      support.</p>

      <h2>CAN Adapters</h2>

      <p>JMRI's general approach is to support as many hardware combinations as possible. By
      supporting as many people and their hardware desires as possible, we can create a growing
      community of developers, hence more code.</p>

      <p>As part of this, JMRI CAN support is designed to use as many CAN adapter types as
      possible.</p>

      <h2>Node ID</h2>

      <p>JMRI on an OpenLCB network acts - in part - like an OpenLCB Node. As such, it needs a
      unique 6-byte OpenLCB Node ID. It builds this automatically every time it starts up by
      combining the JMRI OpenLCB unique prefix with one byte from the computer's IP address and two
      bytes of the process ID of the JMRI application. This allows you to e.g. run JMRI on multiple
      computers or multiple copies on one computer without problems.</p>

      <p>A future enhancement will make these persistent from run to run, so that they can be used
      to easily create unique and persistent eventIDs.</p>
