      <h2 id="connecting">Connecting</h2>
      JMRI provides support for general JMRI <a href="../../tools/Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a> and
      <a href="../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnouts</a> in terms of OpenLCB "events".
      <h3>Settings</h3>

      <p>The <a href="../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">system letter</a> for OpenLCB
      connections is "M". OpenLCB event and object names are introduced below, with additional
      details and formats on a <a href="Names.shtml">separate page</a>.</p>

      <p>JMRI associates OpenLCB Events with individual JMRI objects (Sensors, Turnouts, etc.) via
      the JMRI System Names. A System Name like "<code>MS1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8;1.2.3.4.5.6.7.9</code>"
      defines a Sensor that follows the "1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8" and "1.2.3.4.5.6.7.9" OpenLCB Events to
      change state.</p>

      <p>Another format for Event ID's is a continuous hexadecimal string, such as
      "<code>x0102030405060709</code>".</p>

      <p>These System Names can get very long, in which case the "User Names" become much more
      useful.</p>

      <h4>Sensors</h4>

      <p>OpenLCB messages coming into JMRI applications can be accessed via JMRI Sensor objects.
      The Sensor's <a href="Names.shtml">System Name</a> determines which OpenLCB Events it
      corresponds to.<br>
      A Sensor is defined by two Events: The one that sets it ACTIVE, and the one that sets it
      INACTIVE.<br>
      The Event numbers are essentially arbitrary, and are defined by the OpenLCB Nodes that produce
      them. Because Events are not intrinsically associated with specific hardware objects, and
      because people can use Event ID's in many ways, the specific Event ID's for a Sensor must be
      supplied.<br>
      You create Sensors using the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a> button on the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor Table</a>. If you supply two
      event ID's, the first will set the Sensor ACTIVE and the second will set it INACTIVE. If you
      provide just one, it will set the Sensor ACTIVE, and it will automatically reset itself to
      INACTIVE shortly after. This can be used for events that indicate momentary things on the
      layout like "it's noon".</p>

      <p>When "Show System-specific columns" is checked in the table, there are two additional
      columns shown that are specific to OpenLCB Sensors:
      <dl>
        <dt>Authoritative</dt><dd>Normally checked, this means that the JMRI Sensor
                                  will report its state when a query comes from another
                                  OpenLCB node.  That will then allow that other node
                                  to adjust its own state to be consistent.
                                  <p>
                                  When not checked, JMRI will report the state of the
                                  Sensor as "unknown".  This will allow some other
                                  user of these events to be the authoritative
                                  source.
                                  </dd>
        <dt>Always listen</dt><dd>When checked, all state reports will update local Sensor state.
                                  When unchecked, state reports will update local Sensor state
                                  only if the local state is UNKNOWN. State change messages (Event
                                  Reports) always change local state.
                                  Might be helpful to uncheck this if the Sensor state flip-flops
                                  multiple times after a query, which means that the
                                  Sensor does not have a consistent distributed state.
                                  <p>
                                  Typically when Authoritative is checked,
                                  then this is better unchecked.
                                  <p>
                                  If there is only one authoritative source
                                  for state, then having this checked is good,
                                  because it will make JMRI converge to the correct state
                                  irrespective of how long JMRI has been running.
                                  This is particularly important if the authoritative
                                  producer / consumer of the event does not save its
                                  state between reboots.
                                  <p>
                                  There's also the case where you have two momentary pushbuttons
                                  for setting the Sensor (or more usually, for setting a Turnout),
                                  and those input lines believe that
                                  they are authoritative. This can confuse JMRI (because
                                  typically both are invalid). In this case,
                                  "Always Listen" needs to be unchecked.
      </dl>

      <h4>Turnouts</h4>

      <p>The scheme for Turnouts is similar to Sensors above, except JMRI is producing the OpenLCB
      events instead of receiving them, and the type letter is "T" instead of "S", e.g.
      "<code>MT1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8;1.2.3.4.5.6.7.9</code>".</p>

      <p>A Turnout is defined by two Events: The one that it produces for THROWN
      and the one that it produces for CLOSED respectively.<br>

      <p>Turnouts have Authoritative and Always Listen checkboxes that work the same as the
      checkboxes on Sensors.

      <p>As a special case, DCC turnouts connected via a bridge to an OpenLCB network
      can be addressed as e.g. MTT123. Note the 2nd T for "Turnout addressing". JMRI will
      then automatically generate the correct well-known events to throw/close the corresponding
      DCC turnout.

      <h4>Lights</h4>

      <p>The scheme for Lights is similar to Sensors above, except JMRI is producing the OpenLCB
      events instead of receiving them, and the type letter is "L" instead of "S", e.g.
      "<code>ML1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8;1.2.3.4.5.6.7.9</code>".</p>

      <p>A Light is defined by these two Events: The one that it produces for ON
      and the one that it produces for OFF respectively.<br>

      <p>Lights have Authoritative and Always Listen checkboxes that work the same as the
      checkboxes on Sensors.


      <h4>Signals</h4>

      <p>OpenLCB connections can use many of the usual forms of SignalHeads and SignalMasts that
      are based on Turnouts. In addition, there's an <a href=
      "OlcbSignalMast.shtml">OpenLCB-specific form of SignalMast</a> that uses Events to change
      from one aspect to another.</p>
