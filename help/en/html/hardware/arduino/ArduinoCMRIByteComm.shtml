      <h1>Hardware support: Multi-bit and Byte Communication Using CMRI and arduinos</h1>

      <div class="para">
        <p>JMRI implements the <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml">CMRInet protocol</a> to send and
        receive information via changing the state of JMRI objects:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>sending to a CMRI node that a turnout should be thrown or a light turned on or off
          (any accessory attached to a CMRI output),</li>

          <li>receiving from a CMRI node to indicate that a sensor has become active or inactive
          (any CMRI input).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>JMRI objects are associated with a single CMRI bit in the case of sensors (input) and
        lights (output), and one or two bits in the case of turnouts (see the CMRI help page
        <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L405">section on setting up turnouts and lights</a> for use
        with CMRI). With the introduction of microcontroller technology such as the <a href=
        "https://arduino.cc" target="_blank">arduino</a> CMRI nodes need no longer be restricted to
        operate layout hardware based on single (or two) bit commands. Arduinos are quite capable
        computers that can process CMRINet messages and act on what they receive under local
        program control. <a href="index.shtml#CMRI">An arduino emulating a CMRI node</a> can be
        programmed to start animations, play a series of sounds, light buildings in a realistic
        way, or control the speed of accessory motors -- just about anything the modeller can dream
        up.</p>

        <p>Similarly, it is also possible to send information back to JMRI over CMRINet in the form
        of numbers or letters, or any string that can be encoded in a few bytes of information.
        JMRI would receive each byte as setting the state of eight sensors, but a simple JMRI
        script can translate that binary information into the decimal number or character it
        represents.</p>

        <p class="note">It is also possible to send numbers and characters directly to JMRI from
        arduinos by using <a href="index.shtml#serial">serial communications</a> without taking
        advantage of JMRI's CMRInet capabilities. Each approach has its advantages and
        disadvantages, as discussed <a href="index.shtml#connect">here.</a></p>

        <p class="im"><img src="images/CMRISensorsByte.png" class="floatLeft" height="165" width=
        "275" alt="Sensor Table with 8 sensors&gt; Create eight sensors"> One example of this type
        of usage would be using two JMRI lights (connected to one CMRI bit apiece) to tell the
        arduino to either increase or decrease the speed of a motor attached to an animation
        (perhaps a rotating carousel). The arduino can change the speed of the motor and then send
        back a number indicating the current speed (perhaps 1 to 8) by encoding that number in
        several bits to be sent as part of the CMRINet transmission. A <a href=
        "../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">JMRI script</a> can be <a href=
        "../../tools/scripting/HowTo.shtml#multturnouts">listening to changes</a> in these "speed"
        bits and use them to create a decimal number in a <a href=
        "../../tools/Memories.shtml"></a>JMRI memory variable for display on a panel, as
        illustrated in a <a href="https://www.jmri.org/jython/CmriBitsToBytes.py" target=
        "_blank">this example script.</a> The image here shows sensors 0, 1, 2, and 3 active which
        would translate into the decimal number 15.</p>

        <p class="im"><img src="images/CMRINode-MotorControl.png" alt=
        "Example Panel Using Bit Display" class="floatRight" height="225" width="135">
        Alternatively, a number of sensor bits can be allocated to a speed display with the arduino
        activating the sensors to indicate percentage of maximum speed, as shown in the layout
        panel image. Four of the eight bits of this carousel speed control are "lit" or active,
        representing a speed of 50% of maximum. The panel also shows the on-off slider control and
        clickable greater-than/less-than signs to command the arduino to run the carousel faster or
        slower. The bottom part of the panel shows another example with a curved arrow which when
        clicked tells the arduino to change the direction of the attached Ferris wheel (currently
        off).</p>

        <h1>Example of JMRI setup</h1>

        <p>The steps are fairly straightforward:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt class="left">Configure a CMRI node</dt>

          <dd class="first">
            <p><a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L268">Configure a CMRI node</a> representing the number
            of output bits (JMRI-&amp;gt;CMRI node) and input bits (CMRI node-&amp;gt;JMRI)
            desired. Remember that <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L391">JMRI lights and turnouts
            output to CMRI and JMRI sensors provide inputs</a> (think of it in terms of the CMRI
            node: physical sensors input information to the node; the node then outputs information
            to control physical turnouts and lights).</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left">Create light objcts</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Create as many <a href="../../tools/Lights.shtml">JMRI lights</a> as you need to
            tell the arduino to perform some task. Controlling whether a motor is on or off can be
            done with a single light (INACTIVE (which sends a 0) for OFF, ACTIVE (which sends a 1)
            for ON). Controlling its speed requires two lights - one to tell it to increase, one to
            tell it to decrease, neither on to stay the same speed.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left">Create sensor objects</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Create <a href="../../tools/Sensors.shtml">sensors</a> as shown above for each byte
            of information (number or character) you want to receive back from the arduino. If you
            want to receive the motor speed as a number from zero to seven, you need three sensors.
            If you want to receive larger numbers, you need more sensors to get more bits. Eight
            bits can represent numbers up to 255 (the picture here shows bits corresponding to the
            decimal number 14). Make sure the sensors are linked to the appropriate bits on your
            arduino/CMRI node.</p>

            <p class="note">While JMRI sends and receives a 0 or 1 in the CMRI bit steam, it
            translates a zero into a sensor INACTIVE state, which is actually stored as 4
            (requesting "state" and printing it as a number in a script will return a 4) and ACTIVE
            as a 2.&nbsp; This is important in writing your JMRI script to translate received
            sensor states as binary bits.]</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left">Create memory variable</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Create <a href="../../tools/Memories.shtml">memory variable</a> to hold each byte of
            information that will be computed by the script from the eight sensors.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left">Run script</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Create <a href="../../tools/scripting/HowTo.shtml#multturnouts">a listening
            script</a> as discussed above to translate the sensor states into bits and create a
            number of letter in the memory variable. An example script to convert eight sensor
            states (bits) into a number can be found <a href=
            "https://www.jmri.org/jython/CmriBitsToBytes.py" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
