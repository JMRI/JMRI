	    <h1>Hardware support: Multi-bit and Byte Communication Using CMRI and arduinos</h1>
		
		<div class="para">
        <p>JMRI implements the <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml">CMRInet protocol</a> to send
        and receive information via changing the state of JMRI objects:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>sending to a CMRI node that a turnout should be thrown or a light turned on or off
          (any accessory attached to a CMRI output),</li>
          <li>receiving from a CMRI node to indicate that a sensor has become active or inactive
          (any CMRI input).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>JMRI objects are associated with a single CMRI bit in the case of sensors (input) and
        lights (output), and one or two bits in the case of turnouts (see the CMRI help page
        <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L405">section on setting up turnouts and lights</a> for use with
        CMRI). With the introduction of microcontroller technology 
        such as the <a href="https://arduino.cc" target="_blank">arduino</a>
        CMRI nodes need no longer be restricted to operate layout hardware based on single
        (or two) bit commands. Arduinos are quite capable computers that can process
        CMRINet messages and act on what they receive under local program control. 
        <a href="index.shtml#CMRI">An arduino emulating a CMRI node </a>can be programmed to
        start animations, play a series of sounds, light buildings in a 
        realistic way, or control the speed of accessory motors -- just about anything the modeller
        can dream up.</p>

        <p>Similarly, it is also possible to send information back to JMRI over CMRINet in
        the form of numbers or letters, or any string that can be encoded in a few bytes of
        information. JMRI would receive each byte as setting the state of eight sensors,
        but a simple JMRI script can translate that binary information into the decimal
        number or character it represents.</p>
        
        <p class="note">It is also possible to send numbers and characters directly to JMRI
        from arduinos by using <a href="index.shtml#serial">serial communications</a>
        without taking advantage of JMRI's CMRInet capabilities.  Each approach has its 
        advantages and disadvantages, as discussed<a href="index.shtml#connect"> here.</a></p>

        alt="Sensor Table with 8 sensors> Create eight sensors"> 
        One example of this type of usage would be using two JMRI lights (connected to one
        CMRI bit apiece) to tell the arduino to either increase or decrease the speed
        of a motor attached to an animation (perhaps a rotating carousel). The arduino can
        change the speed of the motor and then send back a number indicating the
        current speed (perhaps 1 to 8) by encoding that number in several bits to be
        sent as part of the CMRINet transmission. A <a href="../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">
        JMRI script</a> can be <a href="../../tools/scripting/HowTo.shtml#multturnouts">listening
        to changes</a> in these "speed" bits and use them to create a decimal number in a
        <a href="../../tools/Memories.shtml"></a>JMRI memory variable for display on a panel,
        as illustrated in a <a href="https://www.jmri.org/jython/CmriBitsToBytes.py" target="_blank">
        this example script.</a> The image here shows sensors 0, 1, 2, and 3 active which
        would translate into the decimal number 15.
        
        <p class="im"> <img src="images/CMRINode-MotorControl.png" 
        alt="Example Panel Using Bit Display" align="right" height="225" width="135">
        Alternatively, a number of sensor bits can be allocated to a
        speed display with the arduino activating the sensors to indicate percentage of maximum
        speed, as shown in the layout panel image. Four of the eight bits of this carousel speed
        control are "lit" or active, representing a speed of 50% of maximum.  The panel also shows
        the on-off slider control and clickable greater-than/less-than signs to command the arduino 
        to run the carousel faster or slower. The bottom part of the panel shows another example with 
        a curved arrow which  when clicked tells the arduino to change the direction of the attached 
        Ferris wheel (currently off). </p>

		<h1>Example of JMRI setup</h1>
        
		<p>The steps are fairly straightforward:</p>
		<dl>
		    <dt class="left">Configure a CMRI node</dt>
		    <dd class="first">
			<p><a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L268">Configure a CMRI node</a>
            representing the number of output bits (JMRI-&amp;gt;CMRI node) and input bits 
            (CMRI node-&amp;gt;JMRI) desired. Remember that 
            <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L391">JMRI lights and turnouts output 
            to CMRI and JMRI sensors provide inputs</a> (think of it in terms of the CMRI node: 
            physical sensors input information to the node; the node then outputs information
            to control physical turnouts and lights).</p>
		    </dd>

		    <dt class="left">Create light objcts</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Create as many <a href="../../tools//Lights.shtml">JMRI lights </a>
            as you need to tell the arduino to perform some task. Controlling whether 
            a motor is on or off can be done with a single light (INACTIVE (which sends a
            0) for OFF, ACTIVE (which sends a 1) for ON). Controlling its speed requires
            two lights - one to tell it to increase, one to tell it to decrease, neither on
            to stay the same speed.</p>
		    </dd>

            <dt class="left">Create sensor objects</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Create <a href="../../tools/Sensors.shtml">sensors</a> as shown above
            for each byte of information (number or character)
            you want to receive back from the arduino. If you want to receive the motor
            speed as a number from zero to seven, you need three sensors. If you want to
            receive larger numbers, you need more sensors to get more bits. Eight bits can represent
            numbers up to 255 (the picture here shows bits corresponding to the decimal number 14).
            Make sure the sensors are linked to the appropriate bits on your arduino/CMRI node.</p>
            
            <p class="note">While JMRI sends and receives a 0 or 1 in the
            CMRI bit steam, it translates a zero into a sensor INACTIVE state, which is
            actually stored as 4 (requesting "state" and printing it as a number in a script
            will return a 4) and ACTIVE as a 2.Â  This is important in writing your JMRI
            script to translate received sensor states as binary bits.]</p>
		    </dd>
            
            <dt class="left">Create memory variable</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Create <a href="../../tools/Memories.shtml">memory variable</a> to hold
            each byte of information that will be computed by the script from the eight
            sensors.</p>
		    </dd>

            <dt class="left">Run script</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Create <a href="../../tools/scripting/HowTo.shtml#multturnouts">a listening script</a>
            as discussed above to translate the sensor states into bits and create a 
            number of letter in the memory variable. An example script to convert eight sensor states 
            (bits) into a number can be found 
            <a href="https://www.jmri.org/jython/CmriBitsToBytes.py" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
