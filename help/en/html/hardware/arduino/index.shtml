    are special purpose computers that, with appropriate sensors and other electronics,
    can be used to emulate DCC command stations and decoders, control turnout machines, light buildings and scenery, 
    and animate just about anything on your layout -- all under control of JMRI.

    <h2><a name="intro" id="intro">Introduction to Using Arduinos with JMRI </a></h2>

    <p>
    Using arduinos on your layout is no harder than you want it to be.  You can get a block
    occupancy system up and operating and communicating with your sensors and panels in JMRI
    in just a couple of hours.  You can also design a custom layout animation that is
    triggered by Logix or a Jython script and take days to work out all the kinks.  You can even 
    use an arduino as your DCC command station with<a href="../dccpp/index.shtml"> DCC++</a>. It's up to you.
    </p>

    <p>
    Software to develop code on your arduino is free online at <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">
    arduino.cc</a>. 
    </p>
 
    <p>
    There are many ways that arduinos can be used on your railroad with JMRI:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>As a DCC command station</li>
        <li>As a DCC decoder installed in a locomotive</li>
        <li>As a DCC decoder attached to an auxiliary device, including turnouts and lights</li>
        <li>To detect block occupancy using current sensing, infra-red, photo-optical or other sensors</li>
        <li>To control a relay to turn accessories on or off</li>
        <li>To directly control lights and create various lighting effects</li>
        <li>To control motors of various types (via optional motor control boards), such as for moving signs, Ferris wheels, etc.</li>
        <li>To combine block occupancy and motor control to create triggered animations</li>
        <li>To control servo motors to create other types of animations, including turnout operation, crossing gates, and many others.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    JMRI provides support to use an arduino as a DCC command station (<a href="../dccpp/index.shtml">
    DCC++</a>) or as a DCC decoder (by setting up a <a href="../../apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoder.shtml">decoder definition file</a>. 
    You can also use arduinos to control one or more auxiliary devices on your railroad by connecting the 
    arduino to your computer running JMRI either through the tracks (in which case it will 
    receive commands as any other decoder) or through an auxiliary network such as<a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml"> C/MRI </a>
    or <a href="../loconet/Digitrax.shtml">Loconet </a>in which case they will communicate with JMRI
    by following the rules of that protocol.  Sections below will help you get started.
    </p>
    

    <h3>Additional Reference Material</h3>
    
    <p>
    You can find information about typical projects in a variety of places on the web.  Some to look at include:

    <ul>
        <li>For questions about using arduinos with model railroading (including use with JMRI), go to the <a href="https://groups.io/g/arduini" target="_blank">"arduini" discussion group</a></li>
        <li>For examples of animations, DCC decoders, and the like, see <a href="https://model-railroad-hobbyist.com/blog/geoff-bunza" target="_blank">
        Geoff Bunza's blog</a>. [Many of these can easily be adapted to communicate with JMRI.]</li>
        <li>For arduino code to implement a number of the topics listed above, go to 
        <a href="https://github.com/Arduini-Projects" target="_blank">this page in Github.</a>
        Also, type in search terms like "arduino," "model railroad," "DCC," and, of course, "JMRI."  
        <li>For just about anything having to do with arduinos and JMRI, go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=model+railroading+jmri+arduino" target="_blank">
        YouTube for hundreds of videos</a>, some with very detailed descriptions of how to set up JMRI to interact with arduinos.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    New blogs and videos are being created almost daily describing additional uses for arduinos on the railroad. 
    With the steady introduction of new sensors and controllers to connect to the pins on an arduino, there is 
    hardly an electronically controllable item that cannot be controlled via JMRI.

    Arduinos communicate with your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer in a variety of ways 
    depending on the function they are performing:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>via a USB port if acting as a <a href="../dccpp/index.shtml">DCC command station.</a></li>
    <li>via connection to the track or a connection to <a href="../loconet/Digitrax.shtml">Loconet </a>
    (requires additional circuitry) or <a href="../can/cbus/index.shtml#thirdpary">CBUS&reg;</a> network if
    acting as a DCC decoder (see, for example, this<a href="https://github.com/mrrwa/NmraDcc" target="_blank">
    arduino library on Github</a>)</li>
    <li>via a USB port if emulating a <a href="#CMRI">CMRI node</a></li>

    <li>via a USB port for direct <a href="#serial">serial communications</a></li>
    <li>via a USB-to-RS485 connector if <a href="#multi">multiple arduinos are connected</a> via an RS485 network</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The following sections provide hints for using some of the different communication approaches.</p>

    
    <h3><a name="CMRI" id="CMRI">Emulating a CMRI node</a></h3>
    
    <p>
    One of the simplest ways to have your arduino communicate with JMRI is to install software that
    allows it to emulate a CMRI node. [See <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml">the CMRI help page</a> for  
    information about using CMRI nodes with JMRI.] On the arduino, install one of the arduino 
    C/MRI libraries and include it in your sketch (for example, the library by Michael Adams
    <a href="https://github.com/madleech/ArduinoCMRI" target="blank_"> available on Github</a> (
    see also <a href="http://www.motorhomesites.org.uk/railway/JMRI_Arduino_Setup.php" target="_blank">
    Stephen Brackstone's web site </a>for an example of its use). See also<a href="#example-CMRI">
     below </a>for a set of steps to get up and operating with an arduino as CMRI node with JMRI.
    </p>
    
    <p>Some notes of interest when programming your arduino as a CMRI node:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>
    Be sure to set the communication speed (baud rate) the same in your arduino sketch and in
    the JMRI <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L215">CMRI system connection</a>.  The baud rate will only 
    be visible on the JMRI Preferences->Connections window if you check the box for "Additional
    Connection Settings."
    </li>
    <li>
    When defining JMRI objects such as sensors and turnouts that are identified with 
    CMRI bits, JMRI starts numbering CMRI bits with 1 while common CMRI software for arduinos
    starts with 0.  Writing ("setting") CMRI bit 0 within an arduino sketch sets JMRI CMRI input bit 1
    for the appropriate node.  Thus, a JMRI Sensor named CS2001 (bit 1 on
    node 2) will be controlled by setting CMRI bit 0 in the code in an arduino sketch.  Reading ("getting")
    CMRI bit 0 within an arduino sketch will read the bit controlling the JMRI Turnout or Light attached
    to CMRI output bit 1 in JMRI, e.g. CT2001 or CL2001 (note that you cannot have both a Light and a Turnout
    controlling the same output bit). See also the<a href="#example-CMRI"> example setup below</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    When using arduinos to control JMRI turnouts, be mindful that JMRI's behavior is different if the turnout
    is defined to have steady-state output vs. pulsed output 
    (see <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L519"> CMRI Turnout Options</a> for more information). It is easier to set
    the JMRI turnout to have steady output and use the arduino programming to take appropriate action
    depending on the type of turnout switch machine you are using.
    </li>
    <li>
    Turnout feedback works differently for CMRI than other networks when also using fascia panel
    switches as part of your operation.  It is easy to program an arduino to have switches throw your
    turnouts, however, JMRI behavior may not be what you expect (if you attempt to send feedback to JMRI,
    JMRI will effectively ignore that and attempt to set the turnout back to what the JMRI turnout table
    says it should be).  See the<a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L519"> CMRI Turnout Options </a>for the correct information. 
    </li>
    <li>
    The <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L568">CMRI Network Manager</a> can be used to turn on and off communication
    to any CMRI node that you want, something that is useful if one or more are temporarily taken
    out of service or being tested.
    </li>
    <li>
    When you change the state of more than one CMRI-connected device (say two turnouts) in one 
    <a href="../../tools/Routes.shtml">Route</a> or <a href="../../tools/Logix.shtml">Logix</a>, 
    you can't be sure whether you will get both bits the first time your arduino program asks for them. After a
    while (typically a fraction of a second), you will, but program your arduino sketch to be sensitive to this issue.    
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="serial" id="serial">Serial communication</a></h3>
    
    <p>
    Arduinos can be directly connected to a USB port and use serial communications via a
    <a href="../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">Jython script</a> executed in JMRI.  An    
    example is included in <a href="../../../../../jython/SerialPortTest.py">the JMRI Jython directory.</a>
    Geoff Bunza describes a <a href="https://model-railroad-hobbyist.com/node/34392"
    target="_blank">serial communication script for collecting sensor data</a> from an arduino.
    It is not necessary to configure a JMRI system connection to use direct serial communications.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="multi" id="multi">Using multiple arduinos via RS-485</a></h3>
    
    <p class="im">
    <img src="images/rs485chain.jpg" alt="RS485 Daisy Chain" align="right" height="211" width="396">
    Although JMRI permits more than one CMRI connection to be configured for a layout, it is often 
    convenient to connect multiple arduinos on a single CMRInet connection. This eliminates the need to have
    individual USB cables going from each arduino to separate USB ports on your computer.  Instead, multiple
    arduinos can be connected via an RS-485 adapter to an RS-485 two wire cable in a "daisy chain" (each arduino
    connected to the next), ending in an RS-485-to-USB adapter to connect to the JMRI computer as shown in
    this diagram:
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Connect each arduino to an RS-485 communication board via the serial pins on your arduino.
    There are multiple sources for the RS485 communication board that
    range in price from a few dollars to upwards of $30.  You will also need a single USB-RS485
    converter, also available from multiple sources.
    </p>
    
    <p>See <a href="http://www.motorhomesites.org.uk/railway/JMRI_Two_Arduino_control_with_CMRI.php" target="_blank">
    Stephen Brackstone again </a>for a good description of how to do this setup.
    </p>
    
    <p>Then include a RS-485 library in your arduino sketch (for example, 
    <a href="https://github.com/madleech/Auto485" target="_blank">
    this one by Michael Adams</a>).  Make sure each arduino is assigned a different CMRI node
    number.  You do not need any additional software on your computer.
    Simply tell JMRI what USB port the converter is connected to and all arduinos on the RS485
    network will be seen by JMRI.

    <h2><a name="using" id="using">Using JMRI Features and Tools with Arduinos</a></h2>
    
    <p>
    Arduinos can be connected to almost any electronic component used on a model railroad, including
    turnout motors, turnout relays, led lighting, and a wide variety of sensors.  You can, for 
    example, define a <a href="../../tools/Sensors.shtml">sensor within JMRI </a>
    that is identified with a CMRI input bit and a <a href="../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">turnout</a> identified
    with a CMRI output bit, both of which are processed by an arduino for controlling a turnout motor.  Or, you
    can identify those sensors and turnouts as "internal" (JMRI objects not associated with  
    hardware on your layout) and use a <a href="../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">script</a> to process the 
    data flow back and forth to the arduino.
    </p>
    
    <p>Here are some examples with links to explanatory articles and/or arduino code that you can learn from:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Block occupancy detectors: Connect an arduino to several block occupancy detectors and define JMRI sensors to report whether blocks are occupied.
    Layout panels will show tracks changing color as blocks go from unoccupied to occupied and back again.</li>
    <li>Location detectors: Connect an arduino to a "point" sensor such as a photooptical module, infrared module, Hall effect reader, RFID reader,
    etc.  Define a JMRI sensor that goes active when the physical sensor is active and use this to control routes,
    Logix, or other JMRI "triggered" action.</li>
    <li>Turnout control: Connect an arduino to a turnout motor or switch machine (will require using an auxiliary circuit board to power these devices).
    Define a turnout in JMRI and a sensor for feedback. When the arduino receives a request from JMRI to thrown the
    turnout (via whatever network protocol you have chosen - see <a href="#connect">above</a>), have the arduino throw
    the turnout and set the sensor.</li>
    <li>Multiple turnout control via serial communications: See step-by-step and code from Geoff Bunza 
    <a href="https://model-railroad-hobbyist.com/node/34417" target="_blank"> here.</a></li>
    <li>Logix triggering: Connect an arduino to a fascia panel switch or pushbutton. Define a JMRI sensor that is used to trigger a Logix to
    do something (perhaps throw some turnouts, set some lights, etc.).  Program the arduino to set the sensor when the switch or
    pushbutton is activated.</li>
    <li>Light or animation control: Add a motor controller to your arduino, create a <a href="../../tools/Lights.shtml">JMRI light object</a>
    to send a control command,
    create a few sensors in JMRI for feedback, and use this <a href="https://github.com/jerryg2003/MRR-arduino-auxmotorcontrol" target="_blank">
    sketch to control an auxiliary motor,</a> such as would be in a Ferris wheel.  Use <a href="../../tools/Lights.shtml">JMRI light objects</a>
    to send commands to change speed or other characteristics of the animation either via serial communications or using
    the byte communication techniques discussed on <a href="ArduinoCMRIByteComm.shtml">this page.</a></li>
    <li>Speedometer: monitor the time it takes for a locomotive to trigger between two (or more sensors), and using 
    the distance between them, compute its speed.  Send that information to JMRI either via serial communications or using
    the byte communication techniques discussed on <a href="ArduinoCMRIByteComm.shtml">this page.</a></li>
    <li>Car counter: using location detectors placed above the level of trucks and couplers, write an arduino sketch
    to count cars as they go by. Connect to JMRI via <a href="#serial">serial communications </a> and write a 
    <a href="../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">script </a>to write the number to a <a href="../../tools/Memories.shtml">JMRI memory object</a>
    which can be display on a <a href="../../apps/PanelPro/index.shtml">panel showing your layout.</a></li>
    <li>DCC Decoder: Turn your arduino into an <a href="https://github.com/mrrwa/NmraDcc" target="_blank">NMRI compatible decoder</a>.  
    Use <a href="../../apps/DecoderPro/index.shtml">DecoderPro </a>to change the configuration variables.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    The possibilities are nearly endless.

    <h2><a name="example-CMRI" id="example-CMRI">Step-by-Step Example Using Arduino as a CMRI Node</a></h2>
      
    <p>
    This example will walk through main steps of using an arduino to monitor a block occupancy sensor and 
    and JMRI using that sensor to change the color of the track of the occupied section on a layout panel.
    This is not meant to be a tutorial on either arduinos or JMRI, but rather to provide a guide for someone generally
    familiar with both but just trying to use them together.  Much more can be found by checking some of the 
    references listed in <a href="#intro">the Introduction above.</a>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>First connect whichever block occupancy detector (BOD) you are using to appropriate pins on the arduino.</li>
    <li>Using the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software" target="_blank">arduino IDE 
    (integrated development environment)</a> or other development environment, create (or download) a
    sketch (arduino program) that includes the CMRI library.</li>
    <li>In the sketch, assign this emulated CMRI node as Node 1.</li>
    <li>In the sketch, use bit 0 for sending the sensor state (unoccupied=0 or occupied=1).  Some sensors will
    indicate an occupied block by a LOW signal on the arduino pin while others will go HIGH - be sure
    you know which is which for your particular sensor so you set the CMRI bit appropriately.</li>
    <li>Connect the USB port of your arduino to a USB cable and then to your computer.</li>
    <li>Note which USB port the arduino is connected to (on a Windows machine, for example, go to Device Manager and see
    which port number pops up when you plug the arduino cable into a USB port).</li>
    <li>Upload the sketch from your development environment to your arduino.</li>
    <li>Open <a href="../../apps/PanelPro/index.shtml">JMRI PanelPro.</a></li>
    <li>Select Edit->Preferences->Connections from the pull-down menus and then "+" to add a new connection.</li>
    <li>Select "CMRI" and "Serial" and then the serial port that your arduino is connected to as shown 
    <a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L215"> here.</a>
    NOTE: you will not be able to simultaneously run the arduino IDE serial monitor and JMRI as whichever if opened
    second will see that the port is in use.</li>
    <li>Check "Additional Connection Settings" and select the same "Baud rate" (serial communications speed) that
    you used in the arduino sketch.</li>
    <li>Click on "Configure Nodes" and then "Add Node."  When the "Add Node" window opens, change the "Node Address"
    to 1 and click "Add Node" as shown<a href="../cmri/CMRI.shtml#L296"> here.</a>
    Close this window and click "Done."  BE SURE TO HIT "Save" on the Preferences window.</li>
    <li>Open the <a href="../../tools/Sensors.shtml">sensor table </a>and create a CMRI sensor with system name 1001 
    (first CMRI bit on node 1)</li>
    <li>Open the <a href="../../tools/Blocks.shtml">block table </a>and create a block.  Set the occupancy sensor
    to the sensor you just created.</li>
    <li>Go to a panel you have created and assign the block you just created to appropriate track section.</li>
