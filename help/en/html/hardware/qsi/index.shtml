      <h1>Hardware Support: QSI Quantum Programmer</h1>

      <p>JMRI can use a <a href=
      "http://www.qsisolutions.com/#!quantum-programmer/c18gu">QSI
      Solutions Quantum Programmer</a> module to read and write
      CV's in DCC decoders.</p>

      <p>The Quantum Programmer hardware is capable of driving one
      (low-current) locomotive in "Ops Mode". This lets the user
      run the engine, test the lights, etc. JMRI does not yet have
      code to do this, but if there's enough interest we can
      certainly add it. <a name="limitations" id=
      "limitations"></a></p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <p>We currently don't have enough information to download
      sounds to the decoder through the Quantum Programmer. If we
      get the information, we'll certainly write this code.</p>

      <p>Note that when using JMRI with the Quantum Programmer, the
      Quantum CV Manager (Windows only) program must <em>not</em>
      be running. If it is, you'll get obscure errors and JMRI
      won't be able to access the decoder. <a name="hardware" id=
      "hardware"></a></p>

      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <h3>Decoders</h3>

      <p>JMRI and the Quantum Programmer generally work well with
      QSI decoders. Some people have had trouble using JMRI and the
      Quantum Programmer with non-QSI decoders, particularly other
      kinds of sound decoders. In those cases, the solution has
      usually been to use a programming track booster such as the
      <a href=
      "http://tonystrains.com/powerpax-dcc-programming-booster/">PowerPax</a>
      or <a href=
      "http://www.soundtraxx.com/access/ptb100.php">PTB-100</a>.
      <a name="connecting" id="connecting"></a></p>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <h3>Driver Installation</h3>

      <p>To access the Quantum Programmer from JMRI, you need to
      install a driver on your computer. This section describes how
      to do that for several popular computer types.</p>

      <h4><a id="driverWin" name="driverWin">Windows</a></h4>

      <p><a id="driverWin" name="driverWin">For JMRI to talk to the
      Quantum Programmer, a driver has to be installed so that the
      Quantum Programmer appears to be a serial port (a Virtual Com
      Port, or VCP). These drivers are compatible with the most
      recent version of the QSI Quantum Programmer software, so you
      can alternate between using JMRI and the Quantum Programmer
      application (though not at the same time, of course).</a></p>

      <p>Max Ettinger has provided <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/install/qsidriver/">detailed
      instructions</a> for how to install these.</p>

      <h4><a id="driverMac" name="driverMac">Mac OS X</a></h4>

      <ol>
        <li><a id="driverMac" name="driverMac">Download
        the</a><a id="driverMac" name="driverMac"></a> <a href=
        "http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/corby-osx-V1_04_1-release.dmg">
        installation file</a> for the Mac OS X driver. This is a
        disk image (.dmg) file that should open as a new Finder
        window. If not, double click on it.</li>

        <li>Double-click on the installer and follow the
        directions.</li>

        <li>Restart your computer.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You should now be able to start a JMRI application and
      access the Quantum Programmer. It will appear as "Quantum
      Programmer" in the Preferences windows.</p>

      <h4><a id="driverLinux" name="driverLinux">Linux</a></h4>

      <p><a id="driverLinux" name="driverLinux"><em>This is still
      being worked on.</em></a></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Download the <a href=
        "http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/cornwall-redhat9-V0_84.tar">
        installation file</a> for the Linux driver. This is a .tar
        archive file.</li>

        <li>Expand the archive to somewhere convenient, and change
        directory to there.</li>

        <li>Try running the installer via either
          <pre>
        ./load_qsi_prog
        
</pre>or
          <pre>
        sudo ./load_qsi_prog
        
</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Configure the Quantum Programmer Support</h3>

      <p>You configure JMRI to use a Quantum Programmer similarly
      to the way all other Connection types are configured.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Start DecoderPro</li>

        <li>Select the "Preferences..." item from the "Edit" menu
        on the main window.</li>

        <li>On the Connections tab, select "Quantum Programmer" as
        the System Manufacturer.</li>

        <li>Select "QSIProgrammer" as the System Connection to
        use.</li>

        <li>The rest of the options are fixed, and can't be
        changed.</li>

        <li>Click the "Save" button. When prompted, allow to quit
        &amp; restart the program.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>DecoderPro is now configured. Restart it, and you should
      be ready to use the Quantum Programmer.</p>
