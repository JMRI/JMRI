<h2> 
JMRI: QSI Programmer
</h2>

<em>This page describes QSI support that first became available
in JMRI version 2.1.5.  Previous versions of JMRI do not contain it.</em>

<p>
JMRI can now use a QSI Programmer module
to read and write CVs in DCC decoders.

<p>
JMRI cannot (yet) download sounds to QSI decoders.

<p>
Note that when using JMRI with the QSI Programmer,
the Quantum CV Manager program must <em>not</em>
be running. If it is, you'll get obscure errors and JMRI won't be
able to access the decoder.

<h2>Driver Installation</h2>

To access the QSI Programmer, you need to install a driver on your
computer.  This section describes how to do that for several popular
computer types.

<a id="driverWin">
<h3>Windows</h3>

<em>This is still being worked on.</em>
<p>
For JMRI to talk to the QSI Programmer, drivers have to be installed
so that the QSI Programmer appears to be a serial port (a Virtual Comm Port, or
VCP).  These drivers are different from the ones that the QSI software uses, so
have to be downloaded and installed separately.
<p>
There are drivers available from the
<a href="http://www.silabs.com/tgwWebApp/public/web_content/products/Microcontrollers/en/MCU_Downloads.htm">SiLabs web site</a>.
<p>
Unfortunately, we have not yet managed to get all those pieces 
together in the right way to make this work.  If you'd like
to work on this, it would be greatly appreciated.

<a id="driverMac">
<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the 
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/corby-osx-V1_04_1-release.dmg">installation file</a>
for the Mac OS X driver.
This is a disk image (.dmg) file that should open
as a new Finder window. If not, double click on it.
<li>
Double-click on the installer and follow the directions.
<li>
Restart your computer.
</ol>
You should now be able to start a JMRI application
and access the QSI Programmer.  It will appear as
"QSI Programmer" in the preferences windows.

<a id="driverLinux">
<h3>Linux</h3>

<em>This is still being worked on.</em>

<ol>
<li>Download the 
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/cornwall-redhat9-V0_84.tar">installation file</a>
for the Linux driver.
This is a .tar archive file.
<li>
Expand the archive to somewhere convenient, and change directory to there.
<li>
Try running the installer via either
<code><pre>
./load_qsi_prog
</pre></code>
or
<code><pre>
sudo ./load_qsi_prog
</pre></code>
</ol>

<h2>Configure the QSI Programmer Support</h2>

You configure JMRI to use a QSI Programmer similarly to the
way all other connection types are configured.

<ol>
<li>
Start the program
<li>
Select the "Preferences..." item from the "Edit" menu on the main window.
<li>
Select "QSI Programmer" as the connection type.
<li>
Select "QSIProgrammer" as the port to use.
<li>
The rest of the options are fixed, and can't be changed.
<li>
Click the "Save" button. When prompted, allow the program to quit.
</ol>

The program is now configured. Restart it, and it should be ready to use.

<h2>Features and Limitations</h2>

The QSI programmer hardware is capable of driving one (low-current) locomotive
in "Ops Mode".  This lets the user run the engine, test the lights, etc.
JMRI does not yet have code to do this, but if there's enough interest we can certainly
add it.

<p>
We currently don't have enough information to download sounds to the decoder through 
the QSI programmer.  If we get the information, we'll certainly write this code.
