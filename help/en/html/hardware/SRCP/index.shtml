      <h1>Hardware Support: SRCP Protocol</h1>
      <a href="http://www.der-moba.de/index.php/Digitalprojekt"><img src=
      "http://www.der-moba.de/images/7/7b/Srcp-clients.png" class="floatRight" height="130" width=
      "159" alt="srcp clients"></a>
      <p>The <a href="http://srcpd.sourceforge.net/">SRCP protocol</a> was created by the <a href=
      "http://www.der-moba.de/index.php/Hauptseite">der Moba</a> model railroad group as a standard
      way of connecting "client" user programs to a "server", which in turn connects to the model
      railroad. There are a number of model railroad SRCP servers available, which in turn can
      currently connect to the layout via Intellibox and M&auml;rklin 605x control units and the Lenz
      interfaces. Also available is a server that can directly create DCC signals via an RS232
      interface, which DCC booster(s) can then use to power the layout. Other SRCP demons with
      other connections are being developed all the time.</p>

      <p>The initial JMRI support allows JMRI to connection to a layout through a SRCP server. JMRI
      can then operate Turnouts, Lights and Signal Heads that can be reached via SRCP. There is
      also initial support for JMRI Throttles via SRCP.</p>

      <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

      <p>SRCP support was introduced in <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri2.1.6.shtml">JMRI v2.1.6</a> during the Spring of 2008.
      That first version had several limitations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It did not support "service mode" for configuring decoders, e.g. setting CVs.</li>

        <li>It needed more testing, especially with M&auml;rklin and other non-DCC systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="connecting">Connecting</h2>

      <p>To use an SRCP connection, select "SRCP Server" as a protocol under the Preferences.</p>

      <p>Next fill in the Internet address for the SRCP server. This can be numbers like
      <code>127.0.0.1</code> or a name like "srcp.sf.net". A server running on the same computer
      can usually be referred to as "localhost".</p>

      <p>Then fill in the port number. This can be obtained from the configuration for your SRCP
      server.</p>

      <p>Finally, save the Preferences and restart JMRI.</p>

      <h3>Third Party info</h3>

      <p>There's a lot of good information on SRCP and how it fits into an overall model-railroad
      system on <a href="http://www.der-moba.de/index.php/Digitalprojekt">der-moba.de (in
      German)</a>. There's an English <a href="http://srcpd.sourceforge.net/srcp/">overview</a> and
      <a href="http://srcpd.sourceforge.net/srcp/srcp-084.html">document for version 0.8.4 of the
      protocol</a>. The overview page has links to some sample implementations.</p>
