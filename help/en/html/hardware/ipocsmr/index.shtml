      <h1>Protocol Support: IPOCS</h1>

      For details about the IPOCS protocol, visit the
      <a href="https://ipocsmr.github.io">IPOCSMR project website</a>.

      <h1>Hardware Support: IPOCSMR</h1>

      <p>The IPOCSMR Connection provides a method of allowing IPOCSMR units
      to connect to JMRI.</p>

      <p>
        IPOCSMR is an Open Source Software implementation of an IP based
        interface to control Model Railway objects such as points/switch
        motors, lamps and detectors. IPOCSMR is designed using ESP8266 as
        the Wi-Fi link to the object controllers and Arduino UNO to
        realize the direct object control. IPOCS interfaces JMRI utilizing
        MQTT and comprises of an interface software running in the JMRI
        environment, an IP communication software running in an ESP8266
        and an object control software running in Arduino.
      </p>

      <p>For details on the system, visit the <a href="https://ipocsmr.github.io">IPOCSMR project website</a>.</p>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <p>Creating a IPOCSMR connection will automatically register
      your JMRI instance to accept connections from any IPOCSMR unit
      on the local network. This is done by registering a 
      mDNS/ZeroConf/Bonjour service that the IPOCSMR units look for.</p>

      <p>This connection currently supports Turnouts, turning
      Lights on and off and Sensor feedback. TCP port 10000 is used
      on the computer running JMRI for accepting connections.</p>

      <h3>Operational Notes</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>The objects username (i.e the username of for example a Turnout)
        is used by the IPOCSMR system. Make sure that the username is the same
        in JMRI as given in the configuration of the IPOCSMR system.</li>
