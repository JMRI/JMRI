      <h1>Hardware Setup Support: Terminal Server Connection</h1>

      <p>A <strong>Terminal Server</strong> is a box that connects one or more serial ports to a
      network so they can be accessed from a remote computer. JMRI running on a computer with a
      network connection can connect to an EasyDCC or NCE Command Station or C/MRI nodes via one of
      these. This allows you to put the computer and layout as far apart as you'd like.</p>

      <h2 id="hardware">Supported Hardware</h2>

      <p>This capability was originally created for david zuhn, who has a <a href=
      "http://stpaulterminal.org/software/jmri/lantronix.html">web page</a> describing in detail
      how he set it up for EasyDCC.</p>

      <p>The NCE and C/MRI set up processes are similar.</p>

      <h2 id="connecting">Connecting</h2>
      To make this work, you have to configure both JMRI and the Terminal Server, and make the
      appropriate connections.
      <h3>Settings</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>To configure JMRI:
          <ul>
            <li>Select the "Connections" tab in the "Preferences" from the "Edit" menu</li>

            <li>Select "Easy DCC" as the System Manufacturer</li>

            <li>Select "EasyDCC over terminal server" as the System Connection</li>

            <li>Enter the IP address and TCP/UDP Port number corresponding to the serial port on
            the terminal server</li>

            <li>Click "Save" & quit the program</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Configure the Terminal Server to connect to the command station: 9600 baud, no parity,
        8 bits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Wiring</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Connect a serial cable from the Terminal Server to the Command Station. Depending on
        the type of the Terminal Server, this might require that you wire a custom cable to get the
        right connectors. Note that you want the "Transmit data" wire on one end to connect to the
        "Receive data" on the other. Do this for both directions, and also include a ground
        wire.</li>

        <li>Make the network connections needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Start JMRI. If everything is OK, the application will start and tell you on the splash
      screen it's properly connected.</p>
