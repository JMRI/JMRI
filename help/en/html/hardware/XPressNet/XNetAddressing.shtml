      <h1>Hardware Support: XPressNet - Lenz Feedback Bus
      Addressing</h1>

      <p>On Lenz systems, feedback from input devices is handled by
      the Feedback Bus. The input available from the feedback bus
      is provided by the Lenz LR100 and LR101 Feedback Encoders, or
      Lenz accessory decoders which provide feedback capabilities
      (the LS100 for example).</p>

      <h2>Addressing Accessory Decoders with XPressNet in JMRI</h2>

      <p>Each accessory decoder is addressed by giving it an
      address in the address space allocated by the NMRA for
      accessory decoders. This allows accessory decoder addresses
      from 1 to 1024.</p>

      <p>In JMRI's tools, you can prefix the address with XT to
      tell system the decoder is accessed via an XPressNet based
      system. If you only have an XPressNet based system
      configured, you can just use the address, and the programs
      will automatically assign an XT prefix for you.</p>

      <p>On the Feedback bus, accessory decoders are allowed to
      occupy addresses from 1 to 64. Since the feedback equiped
      decoders Lenz provides actually include 4 accessory decoders,
      this limited address space actually corresponds to accessory
      decoder address 1 to 256.</p>

      <p>To calculate what feedback device Addresses one of your
      accessory decoders resides at, round up to the next multiple
      of 4, and divide that number by 4.</p>

      <p>For example, if you have an accessory decoder with address
      121, the next multiple of 4 is 124. 124 divided by 4 is 31,
      so this decoder is included with feedback address 31.</p>

      <p>Feedback from accessory decoders is handled automatically
      by the turnout tools included with JMRI. If the turnout is
      equiped with feedback, the Turnout Tool, Turnout Table, or a
      control panel will not update the turnout's status until a
      response from the feedback bus indicates the turnout has been
      thrown.</p>

      <p>Status for decoders that do not report feedback is handled
      by waiting for a response message before changing the
      decoder's status.</p>

      <h2>Addressing Lenz Feedback Bus Sensors in JMRI</h2>

      <p>the Lenz LR100 and LR101 Feedback Encoders are allowed to
      have feedback addresses from 1 to 128. Lenz Recommends
      starting at address 65 and going up to avoid conflicts with
      turnouts providing feedback.</p>

      <p>NOTE: the LR100 actually has 16 inputs, and does take up
      two addresses.</p>

      <p>Each feedback encoder includes 8 inputs. These inputs are
      either either on or off. Each input is numbered from 1 to 8
      on the Feedback Encoder.</p>

      <p>To determine what feedback address is being reported by
      the device, you need to know the address of the feedback
      encoder, and which input you are using. See Lenz's
      documentation for determining how to program the Feedback
      Encoder's Address. This can be done with the encoder in place
      on the layout.</p>

      <p>To calculate the address of a sensor, subtract 1 from the
      Feedback Encoder's address, multiply that result by 8, and
      then add the input number you are using.</p>

      <p>For Example, if you are using contact 3 on a Feedback
      Encoder with address 99, 99 - 1 = 98. 98*8=784. 784+3=787.
      The feedback address you will use is 787.</p>

      <p>In the hardware address field of the "Add Sensor" pane you
      can enter in the encoder address, followed by the contact
      separated by a ":"<br>
      So for a sensor on feedback encoder address 99, contact 3 you
      would enter <b>99:3</b></p>

      <p>In JMRI's tools, you can prefix the address with "XS" to
      tell system the Sensor is accessed via an XPressNet based
      system. If you only have an XPressNet system connection
      configured, you can just enter the address, and the programs
      will automatically assign an "XS" prefix for you.</p>
