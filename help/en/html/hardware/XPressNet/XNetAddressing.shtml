<h1>Hardware Support: XPressNet - Lenz Feedback Bus Addressing</h1>
<p>
On Lenz systems, feedback from input devices is handled by the Feedback Bus. 
The input available from the feedback bus is provided by the Lenz LR100 
and LR101 Feedback Encoders, or Lenz accessory decoders which provide feedback 
capabilities (the LS100 for example).

<h2>Addressing Accessory Decoders with XPressNet in JMRI</h2>
<p>
Each accessory decoder is addressed by giving it an address in the address 
space allocated by the NMRA for accessory decoders.  This allows accessory 
decoder addresses from 1 to 1024.</p>
<p>
In JMRI's tools, you can prefix the address with XT to tell system the 
decoder is accessed via an XPressNet based system.  If you only have an 
XPressNet based system configured, you can just use the address, and the 
programs will automatically assign an XT prefix for you.</p>
<p>
On the Feedback bus, accessory decoders are allowed to occupy addresses 
from 1 to 64.  Since the feedback equiped decoders Lenz provides actually 
include 4 accessory decoders, this limited address space actually 
corresponds to accessory decoder address 1 to 256.</p>
<p>
To calculate what feedback device Addresses one of your accessory 
decoders resides at, round up to the next multiple of 4, and divide that 
number by 4.</p>
<p>
For example, if you have an accessory decoder with address 121, the next 
multiple of 4 is 124.  124 divided by 4 is 31, so this decoder is included 
with feedback address 31.</p>
<p>
Feedback from accessory decoders is handled automatically by the turnout 
tools included with JMRI.  If the turnout is equiped with feedback, the 
Turnout Tool, Turnout Table, or a control panel will not update the 
turnout's status until a response from the feedback bus indicates the 
turnout has been thrown.</p>
<p>
Status for decoders that do not report feedback is handled by waiting for 
a response message before changing the decoder's status.</p>

<h2>Addressing Lenz Feedback Bus Sensors in JMRI</h2>
<p>
the Lenz LR100 and LR101 Feedback Encoders are allowed to have feedback 
addresses from 1 to 128.  Lenz Recommends starting at address 65 and going 
up to avoid conflicts with turnouts providing feedback.</p>
<p>
NOTE: the LR100 actually has 16 inputs, and does take up two addresses.</p>
<p>
Each feedback encoder includes 8 inputs.  These inputs are either either on 
or off.  Each input is numbered from 1 to 8 on the Feedback Encoder.</p>
<p>
To determine what feedback address is being reported by the device, you need 
to know the address of the feedback encoder, and which input you are 
using.  See Lenz's documentation for determining how to program the 
Feedback Encoder's Address.  This can be done with the encoder in place on 
the layout.</p>
<p>
To calculate the address of a sensor, subtract 1 from the Feedback 
Encoder's address, multiply that result by 8, and then add the input 
number you are using.</p>
<p>
For Example, if you are using contact 3 on a Feedback Encoder with address 
99, 99 - 1 = 98.  98*8=784.  784+3=787.  The feedback address you will use 
is 787.</p>

<p>In the hardware address field of the "Add Sensor" pane you can enter in the 
encoder address, followed by the contact separated by a ":"<br>
So for a sensor on feedback encoder address 99, contact 3 you would enter <b>99:3</b></p>
<p>
In JMRI's tools, you can prefix the address with "XS" to tell system the 
Sensor is accessed via an XPressNet based system.  If you only have an 
XPressNet system connection configured, you can just enter the address, and the 
programs will automatically assign an "XS" prefix for you.</p>
