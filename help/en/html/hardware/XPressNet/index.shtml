      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <h3>Command Station</h3>

      <p>The XpressNet protocol allows the DCC manufacturers that
      use it to select what functionality they wish to provide in
      their command stations. This functionality ranges from
      "supports all features" to "bare bones minimal".
      Unfortunately, this restricts the features you can access via
      JMRI - if the hardware doesn't support it, it isn't there to
      be used by JMRI.</p>

      <p>In general, the features that JMRI cares about can be
      grouped into three areas:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Operating</strong> Locomotives and Turnouts on
        the layout</li>

        <li><strong>Programming</strong> decoders on a programming
        track or in ops mode</li>

        <li>Getting <strong>Feedback</strong> from the layout (the
        state of turnouts, ops-mode feedback, etc.)</li>
      </ul>The following table tries to show which systems support
      these three feature groups. System specific limitations are
      also expressed in the <a href="#Limitations">Limitations</a>
      section of each system below.

      <h3>Computer Interfaces</h3>

      <p>Currently the following XpressNet computer interfaces are
      supported by JMRI:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The Lenz LI100 is Lenz's original computer interface.
        It is limited to a serial port speed of 9,600 baud.</li>

        <li>The Lenz LI100F is an improved version of the LI100. It
        supports serial port speeds of 9,600 and 19,200 baud. The
        Factory default is 9,600 baud.</li>

        <li>The Lenz LI101F is Lenz's last serial port based
        computer interface. It is significantly different than the
        LI100 and LI100F in physical appearance, and in the method
        by which the device is configured. The device is configured
        via a software tool provided by Lenz which runs on Windows
        only. We have included a configuration tool with JMRI that
        will allow users of other operating systems to configure
        their LI101F as well. The LI101F supports serial port
        speeds of 19,200, 38,400, 57,600, and 115,200 baud. The
        factory default is 19,200 baud.</li>

        <li>The Lenz LI-USB (Lenz part number 23150 ) is Lenz's
        first USB based computer interface. Internally, the device
        contains a USB to RS232 serial adapter, and an XpressNet
        interface circuit similar to that of the LI101F. Note: If
        you are using the XpressNet version 3.6 update in your
        command station, you should also update your LI-USB to
        version 3.6. There are instructions <a href=
        "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/DigitalPlusbyLenz/conversations/topics/13501">
        in this user group message</a> or on <a href=
        "http://www.lenzusa.com/manuals/xpressnet/liusbupdatev36.pdf">
        the Lenz website</a>. The device is configured via a
        software tool provided by Lenz which runs on Windows only.
        JMRI provides a tool that will allow users of other
        operating systems to configure their LI-USB as well. On
        Windows, starting with version 2.7.2, JMRI supports
        interfacing with the LI-USB through the Lenz LI-USB
        Server.</li>

        <li>The Lenz LI-USB-Ethernet (Lenz part number 23151) is a
        revised version of the LI-USB which includes a built-in
        Ethernet adapter. The USB connection on the device is
        provided by a Microchip chipset and registers itself as a
        USB CDC-ACM (Abstract Control Model) device. For Windows
        users, connection via the USB port will be identical to the
        previous version of the LI-USB. For Linux users, the device
        will appear as a /dev/ttyACMx device (where x is replaced
        with a number). For Mac OS X users, the device name will be
        /dev/tty.usbmodemXXX (where XXX is replaced with a 3 digit
        number)<br>
        The protocol used to connect to the device via USB is
        identical to the prior LI-USB device, so the USB connection
        is supported by any JMRI version with support for the
        LI-USB. When configuring to communicate with the device via
        USB, be sure that <b>Flow Control is turned off.</b><br>
        Connection via an Ethernet connection is available through
        the LI-USB Ethernet connection type, which was first made
        available in JMRI version 2.13.7.</li>
        
        <li>The Lenz LZV200 is Lenz's command station with a built
        in computer interface. The computer interface is very similar
        to the LI-USB and can ve configured using the JMRI tool for
        configuring the LI-USB.  The LZV200 connection option was added
        in version 4.15.7, though thr LZV200 can also be configured 
        using the LI-USB or LI-USB Server options.</li>

        <li>In addition to the Lenz purpose built computer
        interfaces, we have also included support for using an
        XpressNet Phone Adapter (XPA) as an interface to the an
        XpressNet based DCC system. This interface is relatively
        slow, and it only allows controlling mobile and stationary
        decoders, but it may be perfect for someone who is
        interested in trying out the control functions of a
        computer before deciding to go with a full fledged
        interface. Note that <b>an XPA cannot be used to program
        decoders</b>.</li>

        <li>The ZTC Controls ZTC640 is ZTC's USB interface. We have
        had limited experience with this device, though the current
        JMRI drivers are believed to be stable. Operationally, the
        device appears to be similar to the Lenz LI-USB.</li>

        <li>The Hornby Elite's built-in USB interface can also be
        used. Hornby has provided limited information about how the
        device works, and currently only provides a USB driver for
        Windows, so we are unsure of it's usability with other
        operating systems. As with the ZTC640, we have had limited
        experience with this device, though the current JMRI
        drivers are believed to be stable. <b>Note: The first JMRI
        release supporting the Hornby Elite USB connection is
        version 2.1.2</b></li>

        <li>The <a href="http://www.terdina.net/rails/">XnTcp</a>
        interface allows you to connect to your XpressNet layout
        via Ethernet-based networking from the JMRI programs.
        <b>Note: The first JMRI release supporting the XnTcp
        adapter is version 2.1.5</b></li>

        <li>Paco Canada's <a href=
        "http://usuaris.tinet.cat/fmco/lokmaus_en.html#genli">GenLi</a>
        is a do-it-yourself XpressNet interfaces that emulate an
        LI100. There is also a USB version of this device. To
        configure these devices in JMRI, please see the
        instructions for configuring the Lenz LI100.</li>

        <li>Paco Canada's <a href=
        "http://usuaris.tinet.cat/fmco/lokmaus_en.html#genlis88">Gen-LI-S88</a>
        has the same functionality as a GenLI, plus adds an S88
        feedback module. It can be used to add feedback to an
        existing XpressNet equipped layout. To configure this
        devices in JMRI, please see the instructions for
        configuring the Lenz LI100.</li>

        <li>Paco Canada's <a href=
        "http://usuaris.tinet.cat/fmco/rs_en.html#RS2PC">RS2PC</a>
        Interface allows adding Lenz (and compatible) RS Feedback
        Bus modules to a system that does not support the RS
        Feedback Bus. To configure this devices in JMRI, please see
        the instructions for configuring the Lenz LI100.</li>

        <li>Like Paco Canada's GenLi project, there is an interface
        called <a href=
        "http://www.sleutelspoor.nl/technieken/S88XPressNetLI-V0.2.pdf">
        S88XpressNetLi</a>, which is designed and built by Karst
        Drenth and <a href=
        "http://people.zeelandnet.nl/rosoft/">Wim Ros</a>, and
        consists of a small print (available as kit or built
        module) with 2 XpressNet connectors, a serial interface
        (9600baud at the moment), and a S88 connection (both
        traditional and S88-N connectors).</li>

        <li>The OpenDCC project has two interfaces for use with
        JMRI. The OpenDCC <a href=
        "http://www.opendcc.de/elektronik/opendcc/opendcc_e.html">Command
        Station</a> and the <a href=
        "http://www.opendcc.de/elektronik/gateway/gateway.html">OpenDCC
        Gateway</a>. These devices should be configured as LI100F
        devices with the port speed set to 19,200bps. The OpenDCC
        Command Station provides feedback via an S88
        connection.</li>
      </ul>

            decoders from a computer with the Commander.</p>

            <p>If you have an Atlas Commander, and would like to
            use it to control your layout from the computer, an XPA
            and Hayes Compatible Modem may be a more cost effective
            solution than the LI100, LI100F, LI101F or LI-USB</p>

          <dt class="left">Hornby</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>We provide support for the Hornby Elite using it's
            built in USB connection. The Elite can be used for
            operating equipment on a layout (running trains and

            <p>It is unknown at this point in time if we can
            control either an Elite or a Select using one of the
            other interfaces. Hornby's manuals warn against using
            their equipment with that of other manufacturers, so we
            expect some incompatibilities in this area.</p>

            <p>We have a pretty good handle on what instructions
            each Lenz Command station should support. If you find
            that you cannot perform a function you think you should
            be able to using a Lenz system and the LI100, LI101F or
            LI-USB, please let us know.</p>

            <p>LZ100, LZV100, and LZV200 based systems support the full
            range of JMRI functionality. The LZ100 is the command
            station used in the Set-01. The LZV100 is the command
            station used in the Set-90, Set-100, and Set-LI.</p>

            <p>The LH200 provides support only for operating
            equipment on a layout (running trains and throwing
            switches) from JMRI. The LH200 is the command station
            used in the Set-02. You can't program decoders from a
            computer with Set-02.</p>

            <p>The Compact is the same device as the Atlas
            Commander, and has the same restrictions as the
            commander. The Compact is not available in North
            America.</p>

            <p>If you have either an LH200 or a Compact, and wish
            to add computer control to your layout, an XPA and
            Hayes Compatible Modem may be a more cost effective
            solution than the LI100, LI100F, LI101F, or LI-USB.</p>

            <p>The BlackBox is a standalone decoder programmer. It
            can be connected through an XpressNet interface (such
            as the LI101F, etc) with a suitable cable. There are
            some instructions for creating that cable in the LZV100
            manual. The BlackBox only does programming, and cannot
            operate either locomotives or accessory decoders

            locomotives in both service and operations mode.</p>

            <p>The Roco multiZENTRAL-PRO (Roco Part number 10830)
            is the new command station for use with Roco's
            MultiMaus-PRO wireless throttles. The unit features a
            built in USB port, but it is unknown at this time how
            we can utilize it.</p>

            <p>The multiZENTRAL-PRO also provides ports for
            connecting a RocoNet device (MultiMaus, LocoMaus 2,
            etc). These ports can be used to connect one of the
            supported XpressNet computer interfaces, but it is
            unknown at this point what, if any, limitations exist
            when using this connection.</p>

            <p>Paco Canada has two versions of his do-it-yourself
            Nanox DCC system available, both are compatible with
            JMRI.</p>

            <p>The original NanoX DCC system supports operating
            equipment on a layout (running trains and throwing
            switches) and programming locomotives.</p>

            <p>The NanoX-S88 adds feedback capabilities to the
            NanoX system. This feedback comes through the use of
            S88 compatible feedback modules.</p>

            <p>Paco Canada also provides two methods for adding
            feedback to non-feedback equipped systems.</p>

            <p>The Gen-LI-S88is an XpressNet interface that
            includes an S88 feedback module, so it can be used to
            add feedback to an existing XpressNet equipped
            layout.</p>

            <p>The RS2PC interface allows adding Lenz (and
            compatible) RS Feedback Bus modules to a system that
            does not support the RS Feedback Bus. This device does
            not require an XpressNet connection.</p>

        computer's USB port using the supplied cable.</li>

        <li>Install the appropriate drivers.

          <ul>
            <li>For the LI-USB (Lenz part Number 23150) with JMRI,
            you must first install a software driver on your
            computer. Internally, the device contains a FTDI
            FT232BM USB to Serial converter. There are two drivers
            available for this device, make sure you obtain the
            Virtual Comm Port (VCP) driver.<br>
            The device drivers for Windows are included on the CD
            that comes with the device.<br>
            The device drivers for Linux are included with recent
            versions of the Linux kernel.<br>
            Device drivers for Linux, and MacOS (8,9 and X ) and

            documentation indicates the drivers for Windows 7 and
            MacOS are installed automatically if the computer is
            connected to the internet. For Linux, the drivers are
            part of the standard kernel distribution.</li>

      <h3>Connecting using a ZTC ZTC640</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>To connect your computer to one of these XpressNet
        based DCC systems, you can use a ZTC ZTC640 interface unit.
        Connect the ZTC640 to your DCC command station via their
        XpressNet connections. Then connect the ZTC640 to your
        computer's USB port using the supplied cable.</li>

        <li>In order to use the ZTC640 with JMRI, you must first
        install a software driver on your computer. Internally, the
        device contains a FTDI FT232BM USB to Serial converter.
        There are two drivers available for this device, make sure
        you obtain the Virtual Comm Port (VCP) driver.

          <p>The device drivers for Windows are included on the CD
          that comes with the device.</p>

          <p>The device drivers for Linux are included with recent
          versions of the Linux kernel</p>

          <p>Device drivers for Linux, and MacOS (8,9 and X ) and
          Windows are available from the <a href=
          "http://www.ftdichip.com/">FTDI website</a>. (direct link
          to the drivers current as of this writing: <a href=
          "http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm</a>)</p>

          <p>When the device drivers are installed, and the ZTC640
          is connected to both your PC and your DCC system, the
          ZTC640 should have a Red LED turned on, indicating the
          XpressNet connection is okay, and a green LED turned on,
          indicating the USB connection is okay.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Once the drivers are installed, you are ready to
        configure JMRI. Start one of the JMRI-based programs, Then
        go to the preferences panel. This opens automatically the
        first time a program is run, or you can select it from the
        "Edit" menu.</li>

        <li>Select "ZTC Controls ZTC640" from the top selection
        box. You can then select the proper serial port in the
        second selection box.</li>

        <li>The baud rate selection box should be set to 19,200
        baud.</li>

        <li>The fourth box should be left on "no flow
        control".</li>

        <li><b>This option has been removed starting in version
        2.9.5</b> Check Buffer Status When Sending? Defaults to
        "yes" on Windows and Linux, and "no" on MacOS 8/9 and Mac
        OS X. Except when debugging problems, you should leave this
        at the default.</li>

        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's okay for the
        program to quit; click "Yes".</li>

        <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>

      <h3>Connecting using the Hornby Elite's built in USB
      connection</h3><b>Note: The first JMRI release supporting the
      Hornby Elite's built-in USB connection is 2.1.2</b>

      <ol>
        <li>To connect your computer to the Hornby Elite using it's
        built in USB connection, connect your Hornby Elite's USB
        port and the computer's USB port using the supplied
        cable.</li>

        <li>In order to use the Hornby Elite's built in USB port,
        you must first install a software driver on your computer.

          <p>The device drivers for Windows are included on the CD
          that comes with the device and from the <a href=
          "http://www.hornby.com/customer-support/downloads/elite-driver-download-and-installation,110,HAR.html">
          Hornby Website</a>.</p>

          <p>It is unknown at this point if there are device
          drivers available for MacOS or Linux.</p>

          <p>The Hornby Elite has a Green LED that illuminates when
          it is recognized by the computer.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Once the drivers are installed, you are ready to
        configure JMRI. Start one of the JMRI-based programs, Then
        go to the preferences panel. This opens automatically the

      <h3>Connecting via an XnTcp adapter</h3>

      <p><b>Note: The first JMRI release supporting the XnTcp
      adapter is 2.1.5</b> More information on the XnTcp adapter
      can be found on its <a href=
      "http://www.terdina.net/rails/">home page</a>.</p>

      <p>Instructions for configuring JMRI to connect to an XnTcp
      adapter can be found on the adapters <a href=
      "http://www.terdina.net/rails/jmriSetup.htm">configuration
      page</a>.</p>

      <p>During configuration, the program tries to find all
      interfaces available on the LAN by broadcasting a UDP
      request. Any adapter(s) present will reply with their NetBios
      name, which can then be selected. The preferences store the
      NetBios name of the interface, rather than the storing the IP
      address digits, since the IP address can change due to DHCP
      addressing. <a name="connectXpa" id="connectXpa"></a></p>

      <h3>Connecting using the XPA and a modem</h3>

      <p>We have developed an alternative method for connecting to
      an XpressNet based system which should prove to be more cost
      effective on XpressNet based systems that do not support
      programming or feedback via the LI100, LI100F, or LI101F
      computer interfaces, or for those who are interested in
      experimenting with computer control, but don't need all the
      features supported by the Lenz interfaces.</p>

      <p>This system uses the Lenz XpressNet Phone Adapter and a
      Hayes Compatible modem to provide control of locomotives and
      stationary decoders.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Connect your computer to a Hayes Compatible modem -
        either a built-in modem card or an external serial
        modem.</li>

        <li>Next, Connect the "Phone In" jack on your XPA to the
        "Wall In" jack on your modem using the cable supplied with
        the XPA for connecting a telephone to the XPA.</li>

        <li>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based
        program. This opens automatically the first time a program
        is run, or you can select it from the "Edit" menu.</li>

        <li>Select "XPA-Modem" from the top selection box. You can
        then select the proper serial port in the second selection
        box.</li>

        <li>The baud rate selection box should default to 9600
        baud. At this point in time, this can not be changed.</li>

        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the
        program to quit, click "Yes".</li>

        <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>
