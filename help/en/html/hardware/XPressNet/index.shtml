	JMRI Hardware Guide: XPressNet
</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>

    XPressNet is a Command Bus used by
	<a href="http://www.atlasrr.com">Atlas</a>,
	<a href="http://www.lenz.com">Lenz</a>,
    <a href="http://www.hornby.com">Hornby</a>,
        <a href="http://www.opendcc.org">OpenDCC (DIY)</a>,
        <a href="http://usuaris.tinet.cat/fmco/home_en.htm">Paco Canada (DIY)</a>,
	<a href="http://www.ztccontrols.com">ZTC Controls</a>,
        <a href="http://www.viessmann-modell.com/">Viessmann</a>, and
	<a href="http://www.roco.co.at">Roco</a>.
    It was developed by Lenz.  
    The XPressNet specification (available from
    the <a href="http://www.lenzusa.com/techinfo/index.htm">Lenz website</a>) 
    specifies the electrical communications standards and
    command set needed for devices to communicate with the command station.
    While the command stations support the same commands over the XPressNet
    connection, they do not all use the same connectors.  It may be necessary
    to build an adapter to plug a device into a command station from another
    manufacturer.   

<H2>Supported Hardware</H2>

<H3>Command Stations</H3>

<p>The XPressNet protocol allows the DCC manufacturers that use it to 
select what functionality they wish to provide in their command stations.
This functionality ranges from "supports all features" to "bare bones 
minimal".  
Unfortunately, this restricts the features you can access via 
JMRI - if the hardware doesn't support it, it isn't there to be used by 
JMRI.

<p>In general, the features that JMRI cares about can be grouped into three
areas - operating locomotives and turnouts on the layout, programming decoders
on a programming track or in ops mode, and getting feedback from the layout
(the state of turnouts, ops-mode feedback, etc).  The following table tries to
show what systems support these features.  System specific limitations 
are also expressed in the <a href=#Limitations>Limitations</a> section of 
this page

<H3>Computer Interfaces</H3>

    <p>There are currently twelve computer interfaces supported by JMRI:
    <ul>
	<li>The Lenz LI100 is Lenz's original computer interface.  It is
	limited to a serial port speed of 9600 baud. 
	 
	<li>The Lenz LI100F is an improved version of the LI100.  It supports
	serial port speeds of 9600 and 19,200 baud.  The Factory default is
	9600 baud.
	
	<li>The Lenz LI101F is Lenz's latest serial port based 
	computer interface.  It is significantly different than the LI100 and 
	LI100F in physical appearance, and in the method by which the device is
	configured.  The device is configured via a software tool provided 
	by Lenz which runs on Windows only.  We have included a configuration 
	tool with JMRI that will allow users of other operating systems to 
	configure their LI101F as well.  The LI101F supports serial port 
	speeds of 19,200, 38,400, 57,600, and 115,200 baud.  The factory 
	default is 19,200 baud.
	
	<li>The Lenz LI-USB is Lenz's first USB based computer interface.
	Internally, the device contains a USB to RS232 serial adapter, and 
	an XPressNet interface circuit similar to that of the LI101F.  
	Note:  If you are using the XPressNet version 3.6 update in your command station, 
	you should also update your LI-USB to version 3.6.  There are instructions
	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DigitalPlusbyLenz/message/13501">in this user group message</a> or on <a href="http://www.lenzusa.com/manuals/xpressnet/liusbupdatev36.pdf">the Lenz website</a>.
	The device is configured via a software tool provided by Lenz which 
	runs on Windows only.  We have provided a tool that will allow users 
        of other operating systems to configure their LIUSB as well.  On 
        Windows, starting with version 2.7.2, JMRI supports interfacing with 
        the LIUSB through the Lenz LIUSBServer.

        <li>The Lenz LI-USB-Ethernet (Lenz part number 23151) is a revised version of the LIUSB which includes 
        built in Ethernet adapter.  The USB connection on the device is provided by a Microchip chipset and registers itself as a USB CDC-ACM (Abstract Control Model) device.  For Windows users, Connection via the USB port will be identical to the previous version of the LIUSB.  For Linux users, the device will appear as a /dev/ttyACMx device (where x is replaced with a number.)  For Mac OS X users, the device name will be /dev/tty.usbmodemXXX (where XXX is replaced with a 3 digit number)</p>

<p>The protocol used to connect to the device via USB is identical to the prior LIUSB device, so the USB connection is supported by any JMRI version with support for the LIUSB.  When configuring to communicate with the device via USB, be sure that Flow Control is turned off.</p>  
<p>Connection via the Ethernet connection is available through the LIUSB Ethernet connection type, which was first made available in version 2.13.7.</p>
	
	<li>In addition to the Lenz purpose built computer interfaces, we have
	also included support for using an XPressNet Phone Adapter (XPA) as an
	interface to the an XPressNet based DCC system.  This interface is
	relatively slow, and it only allows controlling mobile and stationary
	decoders, but it may be perfect for someone who is interested in trying
	out the control functions of a computer before deciding to go with a
	full fledged interface. Note that an XPA cannot be used to program 
        decoders!
    
    <li>The ZTC Controls ZTC640 is ZTC's USB interface.  We have had limited 
    experience with this device, though the current JMRI drivers are 
    believed to be stable.  Operationally, the device appears to be similar 
    to the Lenz LIUSB.
    
    <li>The Hornby Elite's built-in USB interface can also be used.  
    Hornby has provided 
    limited information about how the device works, and currently only 
    provides a USB driver for Windows, so we are unsure of it's usability
    with other operating systems.  As with the ZTC640, we have had limited 
    experience with this device, though the current JMRI drivers are 
    believed to be stable. <b>NOTE: The first JMRI release supporting the 
    Hornby Elite USB connection is version 2.1.2</b>
	
	<li>The 
	<A HREF="http://www.terdina.net/rails/">XnTcp</a>
	interface allows you to connect to your XPressNet layout 
	via Ethernet-based networking from the JMRI programs.
	<b>NOTE: The first JMRI release supporting the 
    XnTcp adapter is version 2.1.5</b>

    <li> Paco Canada's 
    <a href="http://www.tinet.org/~fmco/lokmaus_en.html#genli">GenLi</a>
    is a do-it-yourself XPressNet interfaces that emulate an LI100.  There 
    is also a USB version of this device.  To configure these devices in JMRI,
    please see the instructions for configuring the Lenz LI100.

    <li> Paco Canada's 
    <a href="http://www.tinet.org/~fmco/lokmaus_en.html#genlis88">Gen-LI-S88</a>
    has the same functionality as a GenLI, plus adds an S88 feedback module. 
    It can be used to add feedback to an existing XPressNet equipped layout. To 
    configure this devices in JMRI, please see the instructions for configuring
    the Lenz LI100.

    <li> Paco Canada's 
    <a href="http://www.tinet.org/~fmco/rs_en.html#RS2PC">RS2PC</a> 
    Interface 
    allows adding Lenz (and compatible) RS Feedback Bus modules to a system 
    that does not support the RS Feedback Bus. To configure this devices in 
    JMRI, please see the instructions for configuring the Lenz LI100.

    <li>Like Paco Canada's GenLi project, there is an interface called 
    <a href="http://www.sleutelspoor.nl/technieken/S88XPressNetLI-V0.2.pdf">S88XpressNetLi</a>, 
    which is designed and built by Karst Drenth and <a href="http://people.zeelandnet.nl/rosoft/">Wim Ros</a>, 
    and consists of a small print (available as kit or built module) with 2 XPressNet connectors, a
    serial interface (9600baud at the moment), and a S88 connection (both traditional and S88-N connectors).
    

    <li> The OpenDCC project has two potential interfaces for use with JMRI.  
    The OpenDCC <a href="http://www.opendcc.org/elektronik/opendcc/opendcc_hw_sch_e.html">Command Station</a> and 
    the <a href="http://www.opendcc.org/elektronik/gateway/gateway.html">OpenDCC Gateway</a>.  
    These interfaces are untested, but should be supported by JMRI.

    	<dt class=left>JMRI</dt>
	<dd class=first>
	<p>JMRI supports the current version (XBus/XPressNet Version 3.0).  We
	may add XBus Version 1.0 and 2.0 support in the future which will allow
	all XBus based systems to work with JMRI.
	</dd>

	<dt class=left>Atlas</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The Atlas Commander provides support only for operation of 
	equipment on a layout (running trains and throwing switches)
	from JMRI. You cannot program decoders from a computer with the 
        Commander.

	<p>If you have an Atlas Commander, and would like to use it 
        to control your layout from the computer, an XPA and Hayes 
        Compatible Modem may be a more cost effective solution than the 
	LI100,LI100F,LI101F,or LIUSB

	</dd>

        <dt class = left>Hornby</dt>
        <dd>
        <p> We provide support for the Hornby Elite using it's built in USB 
        connection.  The Elite can be used for operating equipment on a layout 
        (running trains and throwing switches) and for programming from JMRI.

        <p> It is unknown at this point in time if we can control either an
        Elite or a Select using one of the other interfaces.  Hornby's manuals
        warn against using their equipment with that of other manufacturers, so         we expect some incompatibilities in this area.

        </dd>

	<dt class=left>Lenz</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>We have a pretty good handle on what instructions each Lenz Command
	station should support. If you find that you cannot perform a function you
	think you should be able to using a Lenz system and the LI100, 
	LI101F or LIUSB, please let us know.

	<p>LZ100 and LZV100-based systems support the full range of JMRI 
        functionality.  The LZ100 is the command station used in the 
	Set-01.  The LZV100 is the command station used in the Set-90,
	Set-100, and Set-LI.

	<p>The LH200 provides support only for operating equipment on a layout 
	(running trains and throwing switches) from JMRI.  The LH200 is the 
	command station used in the Set-02. You can't program decoders
	from a computer with Set-02.

	<p>The Compact is the same device as the Atlas Commander, and 
	has the same restrictions as the commander.  The Compact is not 
	available in North America. 

	<p>If you have either an LH200 or a Compact, and wish to add 
	computer control to your layout, an XPA and Hayes Compatible 
	Modem may be a more cost effective solution than the LI100, 
	LI100F, LI101F, or LIUSB
	
	<p>The BlackBox is a standalone decoder programmer.
	It can be connected through an XPressNet interface (such as the
	LI101F, etc) with a suitable cable.  There are some
	instructions for creating that cable in the LZV100 manual.
	The BlackBox only does programming, and cannot operate either
	locomotives or accessory decoders (turnouts) on the layout.
	
	</dd>
	<dt class=left>Roco</dt>
	<dd>
        <p>NOTE: Roco calls their implementation of XPressNet RocoNet.  

	<p>The Roco LocoMaus 2 (Roco Part number 10760) has been shown to 
	support operating equipment on a layout (running trains and throwing 
	switches) as well as programming locomotives on the programming 
	track.
	<p>For programming in service mode, the LocoMaus2 appears to only 
	be able to write to CVs.
	<p>It is not known at this point in time if the LocoMaus 2 
	supports Operations Mode Programming.

	<p>The LocoMaus 2 does not support feedback.

        <p>The Roco MultiMaus (Roco Part number 10810) has been shown to 
        support operating equipment on a layout (running trains and throwing 
        switches) and programming locomotives in both service and operations 
        mode.

        <p>The Roco multiZENTRAL-PRO (Roco Part number 10830) is the new 
        command station for use with Roco's MultiMaus-PRO wireless throttles.  
        The unit features a built in USB port, but it is unknown at this time 
        how we can utilize it.
 
        <p>The multiZENTRAL-PRO also provides ports for connecting a RocoNet 
        device (MultiMaus,LocoMaus 2, etc).  These ports can be used to 
        connect one of the supported XPressNet computer interfaces, but it 
        is unknown at this point what, if any, limitations exist when using 
        this connection.

        <dt class=left>OpenDCC</dt>
        <dd>

        <p>The OpenDCC Command Station should be supported by JMRI through 
        either it's RS232 port or it's built in USB port.  

        <p>We have no confirmation at this point in time that anyone has attempted this configuration.

        <dd>
        <p> Paco Canada has two versions of his do-it-yourself Nanox DCC system         available,  both are compatible with JMRI.

        <p> The original NanoX DCC system supports operating equipment on a 
        layout (running trains and throwing switches) and programming 
        locomotives.

        <p> The NanoX-S88 adds feedback capabilities to the NanoX system.   
        This feedback comes through the use of S88 compatible feedback 
        modules.

        <p> Paco Canada also provides two methods for adding feedback to 
        non-feedback equipped systems.  

        <p> The Gen-LI-S88is an XPressNet interface that includes an S88 
        feedback module, so it can be used to add feedback to an existing 
        XPressNet equipped layout.
       
        <p> The  RS2PC interface allows adding Lenz (and compatible) RS Feedback 
        Bus modules to a system that does not support the RS Feedback Bus.  
        This device does not require an XPressNet connection.

        <dd>
        <p> The Viessmann Commander's Low Speed Bus port supports the 
        XPressNet protocol.  We should be able to use this to connect 
        using one of the supported XPressnet computer interfaces, but the
        limitations of this port have not been determined.

        <p> Viessmann has indicated the Commander's built in USB port can 
        only be used for updating the firmware and sending data to the 
        commander, not for operating the device.

	<p>The ZTC Controls ZTC511 (with Command Station software 
	version 4.0) has been shown to support operating equipment on a 
	layout (running trains and throwing switches).  The ZTC511 does not
	support any programming operations from XPressNet devices.

	<p>The onboard serial interface of the ZTC511 is not supported at 
	this point in time.

	<p>The ZTC521 (with XBus V3.0 software) has yet to be tested, so 
	the full extent of what is supported is not known at this time.

	<p>You can use any of the Lenz or ZTC interfaces listed above to 
    connect to a ZTC system that supports the XPressNet (aka X-Bus V3.0) 
	protocol.

	<p>If you have either ZTC system and wish to add computer 
    control to your layout, an XPA and Hayes Compatible Modem may

<H2>Connecting to an XPressNet based DCC System using a Lenz LI100, LI101F, or LI101F</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Connect your Lenz LI100, LI100F, or LI101F to your DCC Command
    station via their XPressNet connections.  Then connect the
    LI100/LI100F/LI101F to the computer's serial port using a 9-pin serial 
    cable.

    <li>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.  This
    opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you can
    select it from the "Edit" menu.  

    <li>Select your Lenz interface (LI100,LI100F, or LI101F) from the 
    top selection box. You can then select the proper serial port in the 
    second selection box.
    

    <li>The baud rate selection box should be set to match your LI100,
    or LI100F, or LI101F.  From the factory, the LI100 and LI100F are set 
    to 9600 baud.  The LI101F is set to 19,200 baud.

    <li>The fourth box should be left on "hardware flow control" unless
    you later consistently get a message about the LI100 control leads
    being improperly set up, in which case you might want to try to
    bypass that by selecting "no flow control".

    <li><b>This option has been removed starting in version 2.9.5</b>
    Check Buffer Status When Sending?  Defaults to "yes" on 
    Windows and Linux, and "no" on MacOS 8/9 and Mac OS X.   
    Except when debugging problems, you should leave this at the default.

    <li>The series of radio buttons labeled "GUI style" allows you to
    select how the program will look.  "Metal" is the native Java look
    available on all types.  Other choices will vary with your computer
    type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native
    on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and Mac OS X respectively.

    <li>In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default
    programmer format. You can override this each time you open the
    programmer, so this is here just for convenience.

    <li>Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
    quit, click "Yes".

    <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.
</ol>

<H2>Connecting to an XPressNet based DCC System using a Lenz LIUSB.</H2>

<ol> 
    <li>To connect your computer to one of these XPressNet based DCC
    systems, you can use a Lenz LIUSB interface unit.  Connect the LIUSB 
    to your DCC command station via their XPressNet connections.  Then
    connect the LIUSB to your computer's USB port using the supplied
    cable.

    <li>In order to use the LIUSB with JMRI, you must first install a
    software driver on your computer.  Internally, the device contains a
    FTDI FT232BM USB to Serial converter.  There are two drivers available
    for this device, make sure you obtain the Virtual Comm Port (VCP)
    driver.

    <P>The device drivers for Windows are included on the CD that
    comes with the device.

    <p> The device drivers for Linux are included with recent versions of
    the Linux kernel

    <p> Device drivers for Linux, and MacOS (8,9 and X ) and Windows are
    available from the <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/">FTDI  website</a>.
    (A direct link to the drivers that is current as of this writing is <a 
    href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm</a>)

<H2>Connecting to an XPressNet based DCC System using the XPA and a modem</H2>

   We have developed an alternative method for connecting to an XPressNet based
   system which should prove to be more cost effective on XPressNet based
   systems that do not support programming or feedback via the LI100, LI100F, or
   LI101F computer interfaces, or for those who are interested in experimenting
   with computer control, but don't need all the features supported by the Lenz
   interfaces.

<p>This system uses the Lenz XPressNet Phone Adapter and a Hayes Compatible
   modem to provide control of locomotives and stationary decoders. 

<ol>
    <li>Connect your computer to a Hayes Compatible modem - either a built-in
    modem card or an external serial modem.

    <li>Next, Connect the "Phone In" jack on your XPA to the "Wall In" jack 
	on your modem using the cable supplied with the XPA for connecting a 
	telephone to the XPA.

    <li>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program. This opens
    automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select it from
    the "Edit" menu.

    <li>Select "XPA-Modem" from the top selection box. You can then select the
    proper serial port in the second selection box.

    how the program will look. "Metal" is the native Java look available on all
    types. Other choices will vary with your computer type. "Motif", "Windows",
    "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic"
    and Mac OS X respectively.

    <li>In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer
    format. You can override this each time you open the programmer, so this is
    here just for convenience.
