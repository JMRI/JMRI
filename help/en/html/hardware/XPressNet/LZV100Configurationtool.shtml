      <h1>XpressNet LZV100 Configuration Tool</h1><img src=
      "images/LZV100ConfigurationUtility.jpg" alt=
      "LZV100 Configuration Tool Image">

      <p>The LZV100 Configuration tool is used to configure the
      LZV100 through an LI100 or LI101 Computer interface.</p>

      <p>Starting at the top, we have configuration information for
      the Power Station portion of the LZV100.<br>
      The drop down box selects the track voltage.</p>

      <p>The second drop down box indicates if the "E-Line" should
      be Active or Inactive. When active, Power Stations use this
      interface to shut the layout down when there is a short
      circuit, or as an emergency stop mechanism.</p>

      <h4>Buttons</h4>

      <p>Starting on the left side of the screen in the first row
      of buttons, the button labeled "Write to LZV100", will write
      the settings above this line to the LZV100.</p>

      <p>The button labeled "Reset to Factory Defaults" will reset
      the <b>screen</b> to factory defaults. This does not send a
      reset instruction to the LZV100 at this point in time.</p>

      <p>The last button, labeled "Close" will close the screen,
      without sending any (more) information to the LI101F.</p>

      <p>The second row of buttons is options for the Command
      Station.<br>
      <strong>These options will work with the LV100 as
      well.</strong></p>

      <p>The button labeled "Reset Command Station" sends the
      locomotive address 0 function instructions indicated in the
      LZV100 Manual for a command station reset. This will reset
      the command station to factory defaults. See the LZV100
      manual for more information as to exactly what this does.</p>

      <p>The button labeled "Auto/Manual mode toggle" sends the
      locomotive address 0 function instructions indicated in the
      LZV100 Manual to toggle between manual and automatic startup
      mode. In Manual mode, the LZV100 will turn on all Locomotive
      functions that were on the last time the LZV100 was powered
      on. In Automatic Mode, the Locomotives will also resume the
      previous speed and direction settings.</p>
