      <h1>Hardware Support: CTI Acela System Names</h1>

      <p>Individual Inputs (Sensors) and Outputs (Turnouts and
      Lights) in JMRI are accessed via names. For information on
      the general JMRI naming scheme, please see the <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Naming Help page</a> in the
      <a href="../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">Technical
      documentation</a>.</p>

      <h2>Acela Naming</h2>

      <p>For CTI Acela systems, all names start with a system
      letter of "A". After that, there's a <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#type">type letter</a>, then
      an absolute address.</p>

      <p>The absolute address is up to four numeric digits ("10",
      "324", "4"). See the sections on inputs and outputs below for
      the specific meanings of these various formats.</p>

      <p>For example, the first Acela Sensor input pin on the
      second WatchMan module would be named AS8 or AS08. The 5th
      Turnout on the third Dash-8 module would be AT17.</p>

      <h3>Module Numbering</h3>

      <p>Because the CTI Acela system uses absolute addresses there
      is not really a concept of a node (or module) number.</p>

      <p>Before you can access an input or an output on a CTI Acela
      module (JMRI node) in JMRI, you have to define it to the
      program. If the hardware is connected, nodes (CTI modules)
      are found automatically at startup. Nodes can also be defined
      manually with the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/acela/nodeconfig/NodeConfigFrame.shtml">
      Configure Nodes</a> tool. Either way, don't forget to save
      them with the "Save" button on the <a href=
      "../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Preferences
      window</a> (under Edit in the main menu).</p>

      <h2>Inputs</h2>

      <p>Although the CTI Acela network uses absolute addresses, it
      does have a separate address space for all of the Inputs and
      a separate address space for all of the Outputs. As far as
      Inputs are concerned, JMRI supports CTI <a href=
      "../../tools/Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a>.</p>

      <h3>Sensors</h3>

      <p>As described in the Acela documentation on the <a href=
      "http://www.cti-electronics.com/app_sw.htm">CTI web site</a>,
      sensors are addressed starting from 0.</p>

      <p>Each CTI module can contain zero (Dash-8, SignalMan,
      SwitchMan, YardMaster), four (Train-Brain), eight (WatchMan),
      or sixteen (Sentry) sensors depending upon the type of the
      module.</p>

      <p>Addresses are assigned, starting at zero, from the first
      module on the RED side of the CTI Acela module.</p>

      <p>As an example, let us assume we have a CTI Acela network
      consisting of: an Acela module, a Train-Brain module, a
      WatchMan module, and a YardMaster module.</p>

      <p>The Train-Brain module supports four sensors so its
      sensors are at absolute input addresses 0 through 3
      inclusive. The Watchman module supports eight sensors so its
      sensors are at absolute input addresses 4 through 11
      inclusive. The YardMaster module supports zero sensors so it
      uses none of the absolute input addresses.</p>

      <p>The sensors can be configured with the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/acela/nodeconfig/NodeConfigFrame.shtml">
      Configure Nodes</a> tool. If you do configure your sensors,
      don't forget to save them with the "Save" button on the
      <a href=
      "../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Preferences
      window</a> (under Edit in the main menu).</p>

      <h2>Outputs</h2>

      <p>Although the CTI Acela network uses absolute addresses, it
      does have a separate address space for all of the Inputs and
      a separate address space for all of the Outputs. As far as
      CTI Acela outputs are concerned, JMRI supports <a href=
      "../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnouts</a>, or <a href=
      "../../tools/Lights.shtml">Lights</a>.</p>

      <h3>Turnouts</h3>

      <p>As described in the Acela documentation on the <a href=
      "http://www.cti-electronics.com/app_sw.htm">CTI web site</a>,
      Turnouts or Lights are addressed starting from 0.</p>

      <p>Each CTI module can contain zero, four, eight, or sixteen
      outputs depending upon the type of the module.</p>

      <p>Addresses are assigned, starting at zero, from the first
      module on the RED side of the CTI Acela module.</p>

      <p>As an example, let us assume we have a CTI Acela network
      consisting of: an Acela module, a Train-Brain module, a
      WatchMan module, and a YardMaster module.</p>

      <p>The Train-Brain module supports four outputs so its
      outputs are at absolute output addresses 0 through 3
      inclusive. The Watchman module supports zero outputs so it
      uses none of the absolute output addresses. The YardMaster
      supports sixteen outputs so its outputs are at absolute
      output addresses 4 through 19 inclusive.</p>

      <p>Any of these outputs can be a Turnout or a Light. But a
      given output can only be a Light or a Turnout - not both.</p>

      <p>The turnouts can be configured with the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/acela/nodeconfig/NodeConfigFrame.shtml">
      Configure Nodes</a> tool. If you do configure your turnouts
      (outputs), don't forget to save them with the "Save" button
      on the <a href=
      "../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Preferences
      window</a> (under Edit in the main menu).</p>

      <h3>Lights</h3>

      <p>As described in the Acela documentation on the <a href=
      "http://www.cti-electronics.com/app_sw.htm">CTI web site</a>,
      Turnouts or Lights are addressed starting from 0.</p>

      <p>Each CTI module can contain zero, four, eight, or sixteen
      outputs depending upon the type of the module.</p>

      <p>As an example, let us assume we have a CTI Acela network
      consisting of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>an Acela module,</li>

        <li>a Train-Brain module,</li>

        <li>a WatchMan module,</li>

        <li>and a YardMaster module.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Train-Brain module supports four outputs so its
      outputs are at absolute output addresses 0 through 3
      inclusive. The Watchman module supports zero outputs so it
      uses none of the absolute output addresses. The YardMaster
      supports sixteen outputs so its outputs are at absolute
      output addresses 4 through 19 inclusive.</p>

      <p>Any of these outputs can be a Turnout or a Light. But a
      given output can only be a Light or a Turnout - not both.</p>

      <p>The lights can be configured with the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/acela/nodeconfig/NodeConfigFrame.shtml">
      Configure Nodes</a> tool. If you do configure your Lights
      (outputs), don't forget to save them with the "Save" button
      on the <a href=
      "../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Preferences
      window</a> (under Edit in the main menu).</p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>CTI supports a large address space for inputs and
        outputs. JMRI currently limits this to 1024 inputs and 1024
        outputs (equivalent to 64 Sentry modules and 64 YardMaster
        modules). JMRI currently has this hardcoded - but this is
        just a matter of developer priorities.</li>
