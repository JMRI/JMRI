      <h1>Hardware Support: Connecting an MS100 to
      LocoNet&reg;</h1>

      <p>The MS100 from Digitrax allows you to connect many types
      of computers to a LocoNet&reg;.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the MS100 is a somewhat old design, and
      doesn't provide a reliable connection to the LocoNet.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your computer may not be able to connect through the
        MS100.</li>

        <li>Even if it the MS100 makes a connection, you are likely
        to encounter hard-to-diagnose intermittent errors.</li>

        <li>Even if you get the MS100 to work once, it may
        permanently fail due to an update to the computer operating
        system.</li>

        <li>If you have problems with an MS100, there may not be
        anybody who can help you with them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="important">We strongly recommend that new setups
      not use the MS100, and existing users plan on converting to
      a better solution before it becomes unavoidable.</p>

      <p>The <a href="LocoBufferUSB.shtml">LocoBuffer USB</a> and
      the <a href="PR3.shtml">Digitrax PR3</a> are currently the
      most reliable ways to connect a computer to a LocoNet. The
      LocoBuffer-USB is produced by Dick Bronson's <a href=
      "http://www.rr-cirkits.com">RR-CirKits</a> company, based in
      part on the original LocoBuffer design.</p>

      <p>In MS100 mode, the program attempts to open the port at
      16600 baud, the LocoNet rate. If this fails, it attempts to
      open the port at 16457 baud, which is a standard rate that's
      close enough to work. If this also fails, the won't be able
      to talk to the LocoNet through the MS100.</p>

      <p>Because neither of these rates are available, <b>the MS100
      can't be used with Mac OS X, Windows 7 or most Windows Vista
      machines</b>.</p>

      <p>Because we can't be sure your computer will be able to
      talk to a MS100 without trying it, you should test this
      before spending money on the MS100. To do that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start the program.</li>

        <li>Set the preferences for MS100 and your serial port. You
        don't need to have anything connected, but do select the
        port you will eventually be using.</li>

        <li>Save the preferences.</li>

        <li>Quit the program and restart it so that the preferences
        take effect.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you get a dialog box saying "Could not set baud
      rate...", then you won't be able to use your computer with a
      MS100. You should use a LocoBuffer.</p>

      <h3>Linux hack to set the baud rate</h3>Some users have
      reported success using Linux commands to directly set the
      baud rate while the program is running. To do this:

      <ul>
        <li>Start DecoderPro, and wait until you see the error
        message that the baud rate could not be set.</li>

        <li>Run the following commands from the Linux command line:
          <pre>
setserial /dev/ttyS0 divisor 7
setserial /dev/ttyS0 spd_cust
stty speed 38400 &lt; /dev/ttyS0
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Then click on "OK" and continue on.</li>
      </ul>This has been reported to work with both RH9 and FC3.
