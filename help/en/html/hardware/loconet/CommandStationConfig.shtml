      <h2 id="ConfigurationBasics">Configuring Digitrax Command Station Operation Switch (OpSw)
      Settings</h2>

      <p>Digitrax command stations include a variety of "Operation Switch" (OpSw) settings which
      influence the command station's behavior. While each command station model implements its own
      set of OpSw settings, the mechanisms which may be used to configure those OpSw settings is
      common across Digitrax command stations.</p>

      <p>The Digitrax manual for yhour command station will generally describe a mechanism where
      command station OpSw settings are manipulated using "Switch" control operations issued from a
      throttle, while the command station is in a mode where OpSw settings may be changed. For many
      OpSw settings, once the settings have been changed, the command station may be returned to
      its normal operating mode, and the OpSw settings will take immediate effect. For some OpSw
      settings, it may be necessary to change the command station to a different mode before it is
      returned to its normal operating mode.</p>

      <p>For DCS50, DCS51 and DCS52 (Zephyr, Zephyr Xtra, and Zephyr Express) command stations,
      OpSw configuration operations can be performed from the integrated keypad. The
      DCS50/DCS51/DCS52 will automatically perform any necessary mode-change before returning to
      normal operating mode.</p>

      <p>Alternately, JMRI, when configured to communicate with LocoNet, can make command station
      OpSw changes. For many years, JMRI has provided a specific tool, under the "LocoNet" menu
      item: the "Configure Command Station" tool. Recent JMRI versions allow Command Station OpSw
      configuration via a "Roster" entry, as if the command station were simply a mobile decoder.
      Both of these methods are described below.</p>

      <h3 id="Requirements">Requirements</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>JMRI can only configure those command stations which implement OpSw settings accessed
        in the same way in which Digitrax command stations are configured. Supported command
        stations include:
          <ul>
            <li>DCS50 (Zephyr™)</li>

            <li>DCS51 (Zephyr Xtra™)</li>

            <li>DCS52 (Zephyr Express™)</li>

            <li>DB150 (Empire Builder™, Empire Builder II™, Super Empire Builder™, Super Empire
            Builder Xtra™, Genesis™)</li>

            <li>DCS100, DCS200 (Chief™, Chief II™, Super Chief™, Super Chief Xtra™)</li>

            <li>DCS210 (Evolution™)</li>

            <li>DCS240 (Advanced™)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>JMRI must have a properly-configured computer interface to LocoNet in order to
        configure the command station.</li>

        <li>JMRI cannot configure the Challenger or Big Boy command stations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="ConfigViaRoster">Command Station Configuration Using a Roster Entry</h2>

      <p>First, it is necessary to create a new Roster Entry which specifies the correct "decoder"
      type for the command station. Here are some step-by-step instructions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Roster. If you are using the DecoderPro application, this is open by default.
        If you are using the PanelPro application, Select the "Roster" menu item in the "Roster"
        menu.</li>

        <li>Select the "New Loco" button to begin creating a new Roster Entry.</li>

        <li>A window showing the manufacturers of DCC equipment with "decoder" definitions will
        appear. Open the "Digitrax" folder.</li>

        <li>A list of decoder definitions for Digitrax hardware will appear. Select the "Command
        Stations" folder.</li>

        <li>From the list of command stations, select your command station. Be sure to select the
        correct model. If you select an incorrect model, the OpSw settings may be incompatible with
        your hardware and behavior may be unpredictable.</li>

        <li>Give the Roster Entry a unique "Roster ID".</li>

        <li>It is not necessary to enter an "Active Address". You may enter an address, but that
        address will be not be used in any way when reading and writing OpSw values to the command
        station.</li>

        <li>Save the Roster Entry to the Roster.</li>

        <li>Select "Open Comprehensive Programmer".</li>

        <li>Use the Roster Entry like you would for any locomotive.</li>

        <li>Be sure to save your Roster Entry so that any changes which you have made may be easily
        restored at a future date.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once you have a saved Roster Entry for your command station, you may open it at a later
      time and restore those settings to the command station or modify them and then update the
      OpSw settings in your command station.</p>

      <h2 id="ConfigViaTool">Command Station Configuration Using the "Configure Command Station"
      Tool</h2>

      <p>The previous JMRI method for configuring Command Station Operation Switches (OpSws) is
      described at the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/loconet/cmdstnconfig/CmdStnConfigFrame.shtml">Configure Command
      Station</a> tool page.<br></p>

      <h2 id="Limitation">Limitations</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>The LocoNet mechanisms used by JMRI for modifying Command Station OpSw settings do not
        allow modifications to any OpSw which has an OpSw number which is evenly divisible by
        8.</li>

        <li>The JMRI mechanisms for modifying Command Station OpSw settings is unable to complete
        the process of performing some "reset" OpSw functions without user intervention. When using
        the JMRI Roster-based configuration mechanisms, further information may be found in the
        "Notes" shown on the "Internal Storage Management" sheet in the decoder definition.</li>

        <li>JMRI can only modify Command Station Operation Switches using these tools for those
        command stations which implement the required LocoNet messaging. Non- Digitrax command
        stations are not supported by these mechanisms.</li>
      </ul>
