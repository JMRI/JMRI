                <h2>Configuring Digitrax Command Station Operation Switch (OpSw) Settings</h2>
                <p>Digitrax command stations include a variety of "Operation Switch" (OpSw) 
                    settings which influence the command station's behavior.  While each 
                    command station model implements its own set of OpSw settings, the 
                    mechanisms which may be used to configure those OpSw settings is common 
                    across Digitrax command stations.</p>

                <p>The Digitrax manual for yhour command station will generally describe
                    a mechanism where command station OpSw settings are manipulated using
                    "Switch" control operations issued from a throttle, while the command station
                    is in a mode where OpSw settings may be changed.  For many OpSw settings,
                    once the settings have been changed, the command station may be returned
                    to its normal operating mode, and the OpSw settings will take immediate
                    effect.  For some OpSw settings, it may be necessary to change the command
                    station to a different mode before it is returned to its normal operating
                    mode.</p>
                <p>For DCS50 and DCS51 (Zephyr and Zephyr Xtra) command stations, OpSw
                    configuration operations can be performed from the integrated keypad.  The
                    DCS50/DCS51 will automatically perform any necessary mode-change before
                    returning to normal operating mode.</p>

                <p>Alternately, JMRI, when configured to communicate with LocoNet, can make
                    command station OpSw changes.  For many years, JMRI has provided a specific
                    tool, under the "LocoNet" menu item: the "Configure Command Station" tool.
                    Recent JMRI versions allow Command Station OpSw configuration via a "Roster"
                    entry, as if the command station were simply a mobile decoder.  Both of these
                    methods are described below.</p>

                <a name="Requirements" id=
                   "Requirements"></a><h3>Requirements</h3>

                <ul><li>JMRI can only configure those command stations which implement OpSw
                        settings accessed in the same way in which Digitrax command stations
                        are configured.  Supported command stations include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>DCS50 (Zephyr&trade;)</li>
                            <li>DCS51 (Zephyr Xtra&trade;)</li>
                            <li>DB150 (Empire Builder&trade;, Empire Builder II&trade;, Super Empire Builder&trade;, Super Empire Builder Xtra&trade;, Genesis&trade;)</li>
                            <li>DCS100, DCS200 (Chief&trade;, Chief II&trade;, Super Chief&trade;, Super Chief Xtra&trade;)</li>
                            <li>DCS210 (Evolution&trade;)</li>
                            <li>DCS240 (Advanced&trade;)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>JMRI must have a properly-configured computer interface to LocoNet in
                        order to configure the command station.</li>
                    <li>JMRI cannot configure the Challenger or Big Boy command stations.</li>
                </ul>

                <a name="ConfigViaRoster" id=
                   "ConfigViaRoster"></a><h2>Command Station Configuration Using a Roster Entry</h2>
                <p>First, it is necessary to create a new Roster Entry which specifies the
                    correct &quot;decoder&quot; type for the command station.  Here are some
                    step-by-step instructions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open the Roster.  If you are using the DecoderPro application, this
                        is open by default.  If you are using the PanelPro application, Select
                        the "Roster" menu item in the "Roster" menu.</li>
                    <li>Select the &quot;New Loco&quot; button to begin creating a new Roster
                        Entry.</li>
                    <li>A window showing the manufacturers of DCC equipment with &quot;decoder&quot;
                        definitions will appear.  Open the &quot;Digitrax&quot; folder.</li>
                    <li>A list of decoder definitions for Digitrax hardware will appear.  Select
                        the "Command Stations" folder.</li>
                    <li>From the list of command stations, select your command station.  Be sure
                        to select the correct model.  If you select an incorrect model, the
                        OpSw settings may be incompatible with your hardware and behavior may
                        be unpredictable.</li>
                    <li>Give the Roster Entry a unique &quot;Roster ID&quot;.</li>
                    <li>It is not necessary to enter an &quot;Active Address&quot;.  You may enter
                        an address, but that address will be not be used in any way when
                        reading and writing OpSw values to the command station.</li>
                    <li>Save the Roster Entry to the Roster.
                    <li>Select "Open Comprehensive Programmer".</li>
                    <li>Use the Roster Entry like you would for any locomotive.</li>
                    <li>Be sure to save your Roster Entry so that any changes which you have
                        made may be easily restored at a future date.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once you have a saved Roster Entry for your command station, you may
                    open it at a later time and restore those settings to the command station or
                    modify them and then update the OpSw settings in your command station.</p>

                <p>The previous JMRI method for configuring Command Station Operation Switches (OpSws) is described at
                    the <a href=

                <a name="Limitation" id=
                   "Limitation"></a><h2>Limitations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The LocoNet mechanisms used by JMRI for modifying Command Station OpSw 
                        settings do not allow modifications to any OpSw which has an OpSw number 
                        which is evenly divisible by 8.</li>
                    <li>The JMRI mechanisms for modifying Command Station OpSw settings is unable to
                        complete the process of performing some "reset" OpSw functions without user
                        intervention.  When using the JMRI Roster-based configuration mechanisms,
                        further information may be found in the "Notes" shown on the "Internal Storage
                        Management" sheet in the decoder definition.</li>
                    <li>JMRI can only modify Command Station Operation Switches using these tools for 
                        those command stations which implement the required LocoNet messaging.  Non-
                        Digitrax command stations are not supported by these mechanisms.</li>
