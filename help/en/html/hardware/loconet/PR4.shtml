      <h1>Hardware Support: Connecting to a Digitrax PR4</h1><a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/products/computer-control/pr4/"></a><br>

      <p>JMRI may be configured to use the Digitrax PR4 in a variety of ways.
      Exactly how the PR4 will be used depends each user's requirements.  JMRI
      may be configured to use the PR4 to control a "Standalone Programming Track".
      JMRI may instead be configured to use the PR4 to give general access to the 
      command station (including command station programming track) and LocoNet.  
      A third option allows JMRI to interact with a <a href="StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">
      "Standalone LocoNet"</a>.  JMRI does not prefer any one method method over 
      any other method.  You may even set up multiple JMRI "configuration profiles", 
      each with a different PR4 mode; you choose which one to use whenever you 
      start JMRI.  Which PR4 mode(s) you use depends on your needs. The 
      table below summarizes these methods.</p>

      <h2>Choosing the PR4 operating mode</h2>

      <p>When setting up a JMRI "connection profile" for a PR4, which "command station" should
      you use when configuring JMRI?  That depends on what you
      intend to do with JMRI.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>If you will <em>only</em> use JMRI to program decoders on
      the PR4 dedicated programming track, then configure the connection for the
      "command station" type of "PR4 Standalone Programmer". In this mode, JMRI 
      will be able to read and write decoder CV values for decoders on the PR4 
      dedicated programming track.  In this mode, you may also use a JMRI 
      throttle to select and control the locomotive on the dedicated programming 
      track, subject to the ability of the PR4 to supply sufficient current to 
      the decoder.  JMRI will <em>not</em> be able to access the command station 
      or LocoNet peripherals, and JMRI throttles will <em>not</em> be able to 
      control decoders via the "main track".</li>

      <li>If you wish JMRI to be able to control decoders via the command station's 
          programming track and/or main track outputs, and access LocoNet devices, 
          then configuring the connection for the "command station" type suitable
          for your command station is appropriate.  In this mode, JMRI is able 
          to control decoders connected via the main track outputs and access 
          LocoNet devices and the command station's programming track.   JMRI 
          throttles will <em>not</em> be able to run decoders which are on the 
          command station's dedicated programming track outputs.</li>
      <li>If you wish to use the PR4 to provide an interface to a LocoNet which
          does not have a command station, then select "Standalone LocoNet" as the
          "command station" type.
      <li>If you think that several modes may be useful to you, you should consider
      setting up <em>one</em> configuration profile for each of the useful modes.  
      Then, when you start JMRI, you may select the configuration profile which 
      suits the way you want to use JMRI.  And to switch to the other mode, you 
      may simply quit JMRI and re-start it, and select the another profile, so 
      that you may perform some other type of work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PR4 as a stand-alone decoder programmer</h2>
      <img src="images/PR3-PR4StandaloneProgConnections.png" alt="Connections for PR4 acting as a standalone programmer" width="350">
      <p>When the PR4 is configured to act as a programmer, it is
      connected to a dedicated programming track via the screw
      terminals on the PR4. A separate power supply, such as the PS14, <strong>must</strong> be
      used with the PR4 in this case.  When JMRI is properly configured, JMRI
      can use the PR4 programming track to set CVs in any decoder
      that DecoderPro supports.</p>

      <p>This mode of operation can also be used to download sound information into
      Digitrax sound decoders and, within its limited current
      capability, run one locomotive to test it. When used with
      Digitrax SFX decoders, "neutral mode" allows you to vary the
      speed without the motor moving the decoder, so you can hear
      how the locomotive sound reacts to varying speeds.</p>
      <p>Note
      that Digitrax only guarantees programming for Digitrax SFX
      decoders with properly installed loads, etc, but our testing
      has found that the PR4 will work with many common decoders.</p>
    <p>When configured as a standalone programmer, the PR4 is not able
    to communicate with the command station or any LocoNet peripherals.  The 
    red "X" in the diagram above denotes this limitation.</p>
    
      <p>To set up JMRI to use the PR4 via the dedicated
      decoder programming track mode:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start the program.</li>

        <li>Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and
        configure the connection by:

          <ul>
              <li>For the "<strong>System Connection</strong>" setting, select "LocoNet PR4"</li>

            <li>Under "<strong>Serial Port</strong>", select the serial port that's connected to the
            PR4</li>

            <li>In the "<strong>Command station type</strong>" option,
            select "PR4 standalone programmer".</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the speed will be fixed
            at 57,600 baud.</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the "Flow Control" option
            defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which is the
            preferred setting for the PR4. You should try that
            first, as it is the most reliable mode. Only if you
            can't reliably program decoders using that choice, and
            only after checking that you're using the right port,
            should you select "None" for this preference and try
            again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window,
        quit the program and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The "connection" preferences should look similar to this image:</p>

      <h3>PR4 Standalone programmer usage suggestions</h3>

      <p>You can use a JMRI throttle to control the locomotive
      connected to the PR4 dedicated programming track. Use the JMRI Power Control
      or the "Power" menu item on the Throttle's menu bar to turn
      on track power, and then you can operate the locomotive
      normally.</p>

      <p>The PR4 can only provide very limited current to its programming track, so Digitrax
      has built a "neutral mode" into their sound decoders. When
      JMRI and the PR4 is running a Digitrax sound decoder, the
      motor is disconnected to reduce the current load. You can
      still ramp the speed up and down with the throttle and listen
      to how the sound responds, but the motor won't move the
      locomotive.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>To implement that "neutral mode" described
      above, the PR4 automatically writes CV128 to 0 or 1. This
      happens when a JMRI throttle is used to run the locomotive on
      the PR4 programming track, and there's nothing JMRI can do to
      prevent it. Unfortunately, this can interfere with the CV
      programming on some non-Digitrax decoders. For example, it
      will set the "Master Volume" CV128 on some SoundTraxx
      decoders to a very low volume.</li>

      <li>If you are using the PR4 with a decoder that uses CV128
      for something, you should either not use a JMRI throttle to
      run the locomotive on the PR4 programming track, or remember
      to rewrite CV128 with the right value just before removing
      the locomotive from the track.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Other decoders, including decoders from other
      manufacturers, may draw enough motor current to trip the PR4
      internal circuit breakers. This will cause JMRI to mark track
      power as "off". Just wait a couple seconds and turn the track
      power back on to recover.</p>

      <h2>PR4 as a LocoNet Interface</h2>
      <img src="images/PR3-PR4LocoNetInterfaceConnections.png" alt="Connections for PR4 acting as a LocoNet interface" width="350">

      <p>When acting as a LocoNet interface, the PR4 allows JMRI to
      interact with devices connected to LocoNet. This includes
      programming decoders on a programming track attached to a
      LocoNet command station. Where the LocoNet command station
      supports "programming on the main", JMRI is able to make use
      of that feature.</p>
      
      
      <p>To set up JMRI to use the PR4 via the dedicated
      decoder programming track mode:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start the program.</li>

        <li>Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and
        configure the connection by:

          <ul>
              <li>For the "<strong>System Connection</strong>" setting, select "LocoNet PR4"</li>

            <li>Under "<strong>Serial Port</strong>", select the serial port that's connected to the
            PR4</li>

            <li>In the "<strong>Command station type</strong>" option,
            select the command station model which you are using.</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the speed will be fixed
            at 57,600 baud.</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the "Flow Control" option
            defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which is the
            preferred setting for the PR4. You should try that
            first, as it is the most reliable mode. Only if you
            can't reliably program decoders using that choice, and
            only after checking that you're using the right port,
            should you select "None" for this preference and try
            again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window,
        quit the program and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The "connection" preferences should look similar to this image:</p>

      <h2> PR4 as an interface to a Standalone LocoNet</h2>
      <img src="images/PR4StandConnections.png" alt="Connections for PR4 connected to a Standalone LocoNet" width="350">
      
      <p>The PR4 can also be used to connect JMRI to a <a href=
      "StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">"Standalone LocoNet"</a>, which may
      be useful when LocoNet is used for some aspects of layout
      control while some other control system is use for other
      aspects. An example may be track occupancy detection and
      signaling using Digitrax BDL168 and SE8C boards while
      locomotive control is provided by a non-LocoNet DCC system.
      More information on this advanced topic is available on the
      <a href="StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">Standalone LocoNet</a>
      page.</p>
      
      <p>Note that the PR4 is unable to provide either 
      <a href="StandaloneLocoNet.shtml#railsyncgen">RailSync power</a> or 
      <a href="StandaloneLocoNet.shtml#dataterm">LocoNet data signal termination</a>
      to the Standalone LocoNet.  This is a significant departure from the PR3 
      design.  If you replace a PR3 with a PR4 in a Standalone LocoNet
      application, you will need to provide some other source of RailSync power and
      LocoNet data termination the <a href="StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">
      Standalone LocoNet</a> page for more details.</p>

      <p>To set up JMRI to use the PR4 to connect to a Standalone LocoNet:</p>


      <ul>
        <li>Start the program.</li>

        <li>Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and
        configure the connection by:

          <ul>
              <li>For the "<strong>System Connection</strong>" setting, select "LocoNet PR4"</li>

            <li>Under "<strong>Serial Port</strong>", select the serial port that's connected to the
            PR4</li>

            <li>In the "<strong>Command station type</strong>" option,
            select "Stand-alone LocoNet".</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the speed will be fixed
            at 57,600 baud.</li>

      <h1>PR4 Drivers</h1>
      
      <p>The PR4 needs to have a driver installed when used with any Microsoft
      Windows Operating System. See the PR4 support articles at the web links for the PR4.
      Make sure to follow the instructions exactly, particularly
      about the order of installing the drivers and plugging in the
      device.  Note that the PR4 makes use of the PR3 drivers.</p>
      
      <p>Digitrax makes its drivers available on its web site on the 
          <a href="http://www.digitrax.com/downloads/">Downloads</a> page.</p>
