      <h1>Hardware Support: Connecting to a Digitrax PR4</h1><a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/products/computer-control/pr4/"></a><br>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>The Digitrax PR4 can be used as a
      standalone decoder programmer with its own dedicated
      programming track (much like the Digitrax PR2 and PR3), or as an
      interface between your computer and a LocoNet&reg;, much like
      an MS100 and PR3. It can only do one or the other of these at a given
      time. You select the PR4 operating mode in the JMRI
      preferences when setting up s "connection" in the JMRI
      "preferences".

      <h1>PR4 as a stand-alone decoder programmer</h1>

      <p>When the PR4 is configured to act as a programmer, it is
      connected to a dedicated programming track via the screw
      terminals on the PR4. When JMRI is properly configured, JMRI
      can use the PR4 programming track to set CVs in any decoder
      that DecoderPro supports.</p>

      <p>It can also be used to download sound information into
      Digitrax sound decoders and, within its limited current
      capability, run one locomotive to test it. When used with
      Digitrax SFX decoders, "neutral mode" allows you to vary the
      speed without the motor moving the decoder, so you can hear
      how the locomotive sound reacts to varying speeds.</p>Note
      that Digitrax only guarantees programming for Digitrax SFX
      decoders with properly installed loads, etc, but our testing
      has found that the PR4 will work with many common decoders.

      <h1>PR4 as a LocoNet Interface</h1>

      <p>When acting as an interface, the PR4 allows JMRI to
      interact with devices connected to LocoNet. This includes
      programming decoders on a programming track attached to a
      LocoNet command station. Where the LocoNet command station
      supports "programming on the main", JMRI is able to make use
      of that feature.</p>

      <p>The PR4 can also be used to connect JMRI to a <a href=
      "StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">"standalone LocoNet"</a>, which may
      be useful when LocoNet is used for some aspects of layout
      control while some other control system is use for other
      aspects. An example may be track occupancy detection and
      signaling using Digitrax BDL168 and SE8C boards while
      locomotive control is provided by a non-LocoNet DCC system.
      More information on this advanced topic is available on the
      <a href="StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">"Standalone LocoNet"</a>
      page.</p>

      <p>For more information on the PR4 itself, please see the
      <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/products/computer-control/pr4/">Digitrax
      PR4 page</a> and the <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/tsd/product/PR4/">PR4 Support
      page.</a></p>

      <h2><a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/tsd/product/PR4/">Drivers</a></h2><a href="http://www.digitrax.com/tsd/product/PR4/">The
      PR4 needs to have a driver installed when used with any Microsoft
      Windows Operating System. See the PR4 support articles at the web links for the PR4.
      Make sure to follow the instructions exactly, particularly
      about the order of installing the drivers and plugging in the
      device.

      <p>You don't need to install a separate driver when using
      current versions of Mac OS X or Linux.</p>

      <h2>Using the PR4 as a LocoNet Interface</h2><img src=
      "images/PR3toCommandStation.png" alt=
      "PR4 Connection to Digitrax Command Station">

      <p>To use the PR4 as an interface, connect a LocoNet cable to
      the LocoNet connector on the PR4. (Although not required,
      it's also OK to connect a power supply to the PR4). Finally,
      connect a USB cable between the PR4 and your computer.</p>

      <h3>Recommended setup as LocoNet interface</h3>

      <p>To set up a JMRI application to use the PR4 as an
      interface to a LocoNet which includes a LocoNet command
      station:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start the program.</li>

        <li>Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and
        configure the connection by:

          <ul>
            <li>Select LocoNet PR3</li>

            <li>Select the serial port that's connected to the
            PR4</li>

            <li>In the "<strong>Command Station</strong>" option,
            select the type of command station you've got on your
            LocoNet, e.g. "<code><strong>DCS100
            (Chief)</strong></code>", "<code><strong>DCS050
            (Zephyr)</strong></code>", etc.

              <p>The "Stand-alone LocoNet" option should be
              selected if you don't have a command station
              connected; see the <a href=
              "StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">"Standalone LocoNet"</a>
              page. In this case, the PR4 connection will not be
              able to program decoders.</p>
            </li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the speed will be fixed
            at 57,600 baud.</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the "Flow Control" option
            defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which is the
            preferred setting for the PR4. You should try that
            first, as it is the most reliable mode. Only if you
            can't reliably program decoders using that choice, and
            only after checking that you're using the right port,
            should you select "None" for this preference and try
            again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window,
        quit the program and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Using the PR4 Programming Track</h2><img src=
      "images/PR3standAlone.png" alt=
      "PR4 Connection to Programming Track">

      <p>To use the PR4 programming track, connect the PR4 to its
      power supply and to a dedicated piece of track which you'll
      use as the programming track. Finally, connect a USB cable
      between the PR4 and your computer.</p>

      <h3>Recommended setup as dedicated programming track</h3>

      <p>To set up a JMRI application to use the PR4 as a dedicated
      decoder programming track:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start DecoderPro.</li>

        <li>Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and
        configure the connection by:

          <ul>
            <li>Select LocoNet PR3</li>

            <li>Select the serial port that's connected to the
            PR4</li>

            <li>In the "<code>Command Station</code>" option,
            select "<code><strong>PR3 Standalone
            Programmer</strong></code>".</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the speed will be fixed
            at 57,600 baud.</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the "Flow Control" option
            defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which is the
            preferred setting for the PR4. You should try that
            first, as it is the most reliable mode. Only if you
            can't reliably program decoders using that choice, and
            only after checking that you're using the right port,
            should you select "None" for this preference and try
            again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window,
        quit the program and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Usage suggestions</h1>

      <p>You can use a JMRI throttle to control the locomotive
      connected to the PR4 Programmer. Use the JMRI Power Control
      or the "Power" menu item on the Throttle's menu bar to turn
      on track power, and then you can operate the locomotive
      normally.</p>

      <p>The PR4 can only provide very limited current, so Digitrax
      has built a "neutral mode" into their sound decoders. When
      JMRI and the PR4 is running a Digitrax sound decoder, the
      motor is disconnected to reduce the current load. You can
      still ramp the speed up and down with the throttle and listen
      to how the sound responds, but the motor won't move the
      locomotive.</p>

      <p>Other decoders, including decoders from other
      manufacturers, may draw enough motor current to trip the PR4
      internal circuit breakers. This will cause JMRI to mark track
      power as "off". Just wait a couple seconds and turn the track
      power back on to recover.</p>

      <h2>Using the PR4 programming track to program Non-Digitrax
      Decoders</h2>To implement that "neutral mode" described
      above, the PR4 automatically writes CV128 to 0 or 1. This
      happens when a JMRI throttle is used to run the locomotive on
      the PR4 programming track, and there's nothing JMRI can do to
      prevent it. Unfortunately, this can interfere with the CV
      programming on some non-Digitrax decoders. For example, it
      will set the "Master Volume" CV128 on some SoundTraxx
      decoders to a very low volume.

      <p>If you are using the PR4 with a decoder that uses CV128
      for something, you should either not use a JMRI throttle to
      run the locomotive on the PR4 programming track, or remember
      to rewrite CV128 with the right value just before removing
      the locomotive from the track.</p>
