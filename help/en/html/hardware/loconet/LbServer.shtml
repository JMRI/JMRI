      <h1>Hardware Support: Connecting Multiple Computers to
      LocoNet&reg; via LbServer</h1>

      <p>This page describes how to configure multiple JMRI nodes
      to connect as clients to a single <a href=
      "http://loconetovertcp.sourceforge.net">LocoNetOverTCP
      LbServer</a>, which in turn is connected to the layout.</p>

      <p>This connection, called LocoNetOverTCP, uses a separate
      non-Java server process, LbServer, that communicates using
      plain ASCII String messages over TCP/IP sockets, allowing
      non-Java nodes to also share the one LocoBuffer.</p>

      <h2>Setup for JMRI LocoNetOverTCP</h2>One computer runs the
      LbServer program that connects to the LocoBuffer and acts as
      a Server to all the JMRI Client computers. Configure the JMRI
      Client computers to connect to the LbServer as follows:

      <ul>
        <li>Make sure the LbServer is configured and running. See
        LbServer documentations for details.</li>

        <li>Open the JMRI program on the Client</li>

        <li>Open the preferences from the Edit menu</li>

        <li>For layout connection, select "LocoNetOverTCP
        LbServer"</li>

        <li>In the "Server hostname" box that appears, type the
        Internet name or address of the computer that's running the
        LbServer. An internet address is something like 127.0.1.12;
        a name is something like jmri.org</li>

        <li>In the "TCP Port Number" box enter the port number that
        LbServer is using, which by default is 1234.</li>

        <li>Save the preferences and restart the program.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Notes:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>It's strongly recommended that you connect the master
        computer to the LocoNet&reg; with a LocoBuffer or
        LocoBuffer-II. Although a MS-100 will basically work for
        this application, correction of the resulting occasional
        LocoNet errors may cause noticeable delays in updating the
        remote computers.</li>

        <li>If the computers are all close to the LocoNet, e.g.
        acting as local control panels, you don't really need
        LocoNet Server to do this. You can instead connect each of
        the computers to the LocoNet via their own LocoBuffer or
        LocoBuffer-II (or MS-100, though this is not recommended)
        and have them individually take part in the LocoNet
        communications. This doesn't cause any additional
        communications load. It does cost a little more for the
        extra adapters, and doesn't permit you to put a computer
        remote from the layout.</li>

        <li>The computer running LbServer can also run JMRI
        software, in this case the Client and Server just happen to
        be on the same node.</li>

        <li>Some firewall software will detect LbServer's use of
        port 1234 as a trojan and will want to block access to the
        port. To get around this you will either have to enable
        access in your firewall software or change the port to
        another number like 9999 say. The new port number will also
        need to be passed into LbServer as a command line
        option.</li>
      </ul>
