      <h1>Hardware Support: Methods to Connect Multiple Computers
      to a LocoNet&reg; Layout</h1>

      <p>JMRI currently supports two different ways to connect
      multiple computers to your LocoNet&reg;-equipped layout using
      a single LocoBuffer. In both methods, the computers
      communicate using standard TCP/IP protocols, but there are
      differences in the details.</p>

      <p>
      One method allows multiple JMRI nodes to connect as
      Clients to a single <a href=
      "http://loconetovertcp.sourceforge.net/Interface/index.html">LocoNetOverTCP
      LbServer</a>, which is external to JMRI.<br>
      The other method uses the inbuilt <a href=
      "LocoNetServer.shtml">LocoNet Client/Server capability</a> of
      JMRI.
      </p>

      <p>The difference between these two methods is that 
      JMRI LocoNet Client/Server uses the native Java Remote Method
      Invocation (RMI) protocol, 
      whereas the 
      LocoNetOverTCP uses a
      separate non-Java server process, LbServer, that communicates
      using plain ASCII String messages over TCP/IP sockets,
      allowing non-Java nodes to also share the one LocoBuffer.</p>

      <p>For most people who simply want to have several computers
      share a single LocoBuffer connection, the <a href=
      "LocoNetServer.shtml">JMRI LocoNet Client/Server option</a>
      can be easier to configure. For
      others wanting to provide remote access the layout over
      Internet, the <a href="LbServer.shtml">LocoNetOverTCP
      LbServer option</a> may be more suitable as configuring the firewall rules
      to allow external access will be simpler.
      Setting up networking equipment can be complicated, so if 
      one of them doesn't work for you initially, you might want to 
      just try the other one to see if it works on your home network.</p>

        Client/Server</a></li>

        <li><a href="LbServer.shtml">How to set up LocoNetOverTCP
        LbServer</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Notes:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>If the computers are all close to the LocoNet, e.g.
        acting as local control panels, you don't really need any
        networking to do this. You can instead connect each of the
        computers to the LocoNet via their own LocoBuffer or
        LocoBuffer-II (or MS-100, though this is not recommended)
        and have them individually take part in the LocoNet
        communications. This doesn't cause any additional
        communications load. It does cost a little more for the
        extra adapters, and doesn't permit you to put a computer
        remote from the layout.</li>
