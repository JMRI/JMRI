      <h1>Hardware Support: Methods to Connect Multiple Computers to a LocoNet® Layout</h1>

      <p>JMRI currently supports two different ways to connect multiple computers to your
      LocoNet®-equipped layout using a single LocoBuffer. In both methods, the computers
      communicate using standard TCP/IP protocols, but there are differences in the details.</p>

      <p>One method allows multiple JMRI nodes to connect as Clients to a single <a href=
      "http://loconetovertcp.sourceforge.net/Interface/index.html">LocoNetOverTCP LbServer</a>,
      which is external to JMRI.<br>
      The other method uses the inbuilt <a href="LocoNetServer.shtml">LocoNet Client/Server
      capability</a> of JMRI.</p>

      <p>The difference between these two methods is that JMRI LocoNet Client/Server uses the
      native Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) protocol, whereas the LocoNetOverTCP uses a
      separate non-Java server process, LbServer, that communicates using plain ASCII String
      messages over TCP/IP sockets, allowing non-Java nodes to also share the one LocoBuffer.</p>

      <p>For most people who simply want to have several computers share a single LocoBuffer
      connection, the <a href="LocoNetServer.shtml">JMRI LocoNet Client/Server option</a> can be
      easier to configure. For others wanting to provide remote access the layout over Internet,
      the <a href="LbServer.shtml">LocoNetOverTCP LbServer option</a> may be more suitable as
      configuring the firewall rules to allow external access will be simpler. Setting up
      networking equipment can be complicated, so if one of them doesn't work for you initially,
      you might want to just try the other one to see if it works on your home network.</p>

      <h2>Notes:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>If the computers are all close to the LocoNet, e.g. acting as local control panels, you
        don't really need any networking to do this. You can instead connect each of the computers
        to the LocoNet via their own LocoBuffer or LocoBuffer-II (or MS-100, though this is not
        recommended) and have them individually take part in the LocoNet communications. This
        doesn't cause any additional communications load. It does cost a little more for the extra
        adapters, and doesn't permit you to put a computer remote from the layout.</li>
