  <h1>Hardware Support: Methods to Connect Multiple Computers to a LocoNet&reg; Layout</h1>
  
<p>
JMRI currently supports two different ways to connect multiple
computers to your LocoNet&reg;-equipped layout
using a single LocoBuffer. In both methods, the computers communicate using standard
TCP/IP protocols, but there are differences in the details.
<p>
One method uses the inbuilt 
<a href="LocoNetServer.shtml">LocoNet Client/Server capability</a>
of JMRI.<br>
The other method 
allows multiple JMRI nodes to connect as Clients to a single 
<a href="http://loconetovertcp.sourceforge.net/Interface/index.html">LocoNetOverTCP LbServer</a>, 
which is external to JMRI.
<p>
The difference between these two methods is that JMRI LocoNet Client/Server uses 
the native Java
Remote Method Invocation (RMI) protocol, whereas the LocoNetOverTCP uses a separate non-Java 
server process, LbServer, that communicates using plain ASCII String messages over TCP/IP sockets,
allowing non-Java nodes to also share the one LocoBuffer.
<p>
For most people who simply want to have several computers share a
single LocoBuffer connection,
the 
<a href="LocoNetServer.shtml">JMRI LocoNet Client/Server option</a>
is probably the best choice as 
it is easy to configure.
For others wanting to provide remote access the layout over Internet, the 
<a href="LbServer.shtml">LocoNetOverTCP LbServer option</a>
may be more suitable as firewall rule 
changes to allow external access will be simpler.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's strongly recommended that you connect the master computer
to the LocoNet with a LocoBuffer or LocoBuffer-II.  Although a MS-100
will basically work for this application, correction of the resulting occasional LocoNet
errors may cause noticeable delays in updating the remote computers.
<li>
If the computers are all close to the LocoNet, e.g. acting as local control
panels, you don't really need any networking to do this.  You can instead
connect each of the computers to the LocoNet via their own LocoBuffer or LocoBuffer-II
(or MS-100, though this is not recommended) and have them individually take part
in the LocoNet communications.  This doesn't cause any additional communications load.
It does cost a little more for the extra adapters, and doesn't permit you to
put a computer remote from the layout.
