The Digitrax PR3 can be used as either a standalone
decoder programmer much like the PR2, or as an 
interface between your computer and a LocoNet, much
like an MS100. It can only do one or the other 
of these at a given time. You select the mode
of operation in the JMRI preferences during setup.

<p>
When the PR3 is acting as a programmer, it can be used
to set CVs in all decoders that DecoderPro supports.
It can also be used to download sound information into
Digitrax sound decoders and, within its limited current
capability, run one locomotive to test it. When used with 
Digitrax SFX decoders, "neutral mode" allows you to vary the speed
without the motor moving the deocder, so you can hear how the locomotive
sound reacts to varying speeds.
(Note that Digitrax only guarantees programming for Digitrax
SFX decoders with properly installed loads, etc, but our testing
has found that the PR3 will work with many common decoders)

<p>
When acting as an interface, the PR3 allows JMRI full control of the 
LocoNet and the devices attached to it.
That includes programming
decoders on a programming track attached to a LocoNet command station,
or on the main track.
The PR3 can also serve
as the "LocoNet terminator", which allows it to drive a 
LocoNet without an attached command station, e.g. if you want
to have a LocoNet dedicated to signaling.

<p>
For more information on the PR3 itself, please see the
<a href="http://digitrax.com/prd_compint_pr3.php">Digitrax PR3 page</a>
and the 
<a href="http://www.digitrax.com/kb/index.php?c=338">PR3 page</a>
in the 
<a href="http://www.digitrax.com/kb/index.php">Digitrax Knowledge Base</a>.

<h3>Drivers</h3>
The PR3 needs to have a driver installed when used with
Microsoft Windows.  See the 
<a href="http://digitrax.com/prd_compint_pr3.php">Digitrax PR3 page</a>
for more information.  Make sure to follow the instructions
exactly, particularly about the order of installing the drivers
and plugging in the device.

<p>
You don't need to install a separate
driver when using current versions of Mac OS X or Linux.

<h2>Using the PR3 as a LocoNet Interface</h2>

<img src="images/PR3toCommandStation.png" align="right" height="120" width="426">

To use the PR3 as an interface, connect a LocoNet cable to the
LocoNet connector on the PR3.  
(Although not required, it's also OK to connect a power supply to the PR3).
Finally, connect a USB cable between the PR3 and your computer.

<h3>Recommended setup</h3>
<p>
To set up a JMRI application to use the PR3 as an interface:
</p>

<UL>
<LI>
Start the program.
<li>
Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and configure the connection by:
<UL>
<LI>Select LocoNet PR3
<LI>Select the serial port that's connected to the PR3
<li>The speed will be fixed at 57,600 baud; don't try to change this 
in your computer's settings
<li>The "Flow Control" option defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which
uses the status leads in the serial connection to determine when the PR3
is ready to send and receive.  You should try that first, as it is the most
reliable mode.  
Only if you can't connect to your LocoNet with that setting,
and only after checking that you're using the right port, should you select "None" for 
this preference and try again.
<li>In the "Command Station" option, select the type of command station you've
got on your LocoNet, e.g. DCS100 (Chief), DCS050 (Zephyr), etc.  
The "Stand-alone LocoNet" option should be selected if you don't have a command
station connected.
</UL>
<li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window, quit the program and restart.
</UL>


<h2>Using the PR3 Programming Track</h2>

<img src="images/PR3standAlone.png" align="right" height="194" width="399">

To use the PR3 programming track, 
connect the PR3 to its power supply and to a 
dedicated piece of track which you'll use as the programming track.
Finally, connect a USB cable between the PR3 and your computer.

<h3>Recommended setup</h3>
<p>
To set up DecoderPro to use the PR3:
</p>

<UL>
<LI>
Start DecoderPro.
<li>
Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and configure the connection by:
<UL>
<LI>Select LocoNet PR3
<LI>Select the serial port that's connected to the PR3
<li>The speed will be fixed at 57,600 baud; don't try to change this 
in your computer's settings
<li>The "Flow Control" option defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which
uses the status leads in the serial connection to determine when the PR3
is ready to send and receive.  You should try that first, as it is the most
reliable mode.  
Only if you can't program decoders using that choice, 
and only after checking that you're using the right port, should you select "None" for 
this preference and try again.
<li>In the "Command Station" option, select "PR3 Programmer".
</UL>
<li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window, quit the program and restart.
</UL>

<h3>Usage suggestions</h3>

<P> 
You can use a JMRI throttle to control the locomotive connected
to the PR3 Programmer. Use the JMRI Power Control or the "Power" menu item 
on the Throttle's menu bar to turn on track power, and then you 
can operate the locomotive normally.  

<p>The PR3 can only
provide very limited current, so Digitrax has built a "neutral mode"
into their sound decoders.  When JMRI and the PR3 is running
a Digitrax sound decoder, the motor is disconnected to reduce the current load.
You can still ramp the speed up and down with the throttle and listen to
how the sound responds, but the motor won't move the locomotive.

<p>
Other decoders, including decoders from other manufacturers, may 
draw enough motor current to trip the PR3 internal circuit breakers.
This will cause JMRI to mark track power as "off". Just wait a couple
seconds and turn the track power back on to recover.

<h4>Using the PR3 with Non-Digitrax Decoders</h4>

To implement that "neutral mode" described above, the PR3 automatically
writes CV128 to 0 or 1.  This happens when a JMRI throttle is used to
run the locomotive on the PR3 programming track, and there's nothing
JMRI can do to prevent it.  Unfortunately, this can interfere with the 
CV programming on some non-Digitrax decoders.  For example, it will set
the "Master Volume" CV128 on some Soundtraxx decoders to a very low volume.
<p>
If you are using the PR3 with a decoder that uses CV128 for something, 
you should either not use a JMRI throttle to run the locomotive on the
PR3 programming track, or remember to rewrite CV128 with the right value 
just before removing the locomotive from the track.
