      <h1>Hardware Support: Connecting to a Digitrax PR3
      (Xtra)</h1><a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/products/computer-control/pr3xtra/"><img src="http://www.digitrax.com/static/apps/products/computer-control/pr3/images/PR3_jpg_350x900_q85.jpg"
      alt="PR3 picture"></a><br>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>The Digitrax PR3 (Xtra) can be used as a
      standalone decoder programmer with its own dedicated
      programming track (much like the Digitrax PR2), or as an
      interface between your computer and a LocoNet&reg;, much like
      an MS100. It can only do one or the other of these at a given
      time. You select the PR3 operating mode in the JMRI
      preferences when setting up s "connection" in the JMRI
      "preferences".

      <p>Digitrax has released a product called the "PR3 Xtra".
      This is simply a PR3 device plus a suitable power supply. It
      may be considered as "identical" to a PR3 for all practical
      purposes.</p>
      
      <p>Digitrax introduced the DCS240 device in 2016.  This 
      command station includes an integrated PR3 device.  For the 
      purposes of JMRI, the DCS240 USB interface device is equivalent 
      to a PR3.</p>

      <h1>PR3 as a stand-alone decoder programmer</h1>

      <p>When the PR3 is configured to act as a programmer, it is
      connected to a dedicated programming track via the screw
      terminals on the PR3. When JMRI is properly configured, JMRI
      can use the PR3 programming track to set CVs in any decoder
      that DecoderPro supports.</p>

      <p>It can also be used to download sound information into
      Digitrax sound decoders and, within its limited current
      capability, run one locomotive to test it. When used with
      Digitrax SFX decoders, "neutral mode" allows you to vary the
      speed without the motor moving the decoder, so you can hear
      how the locomotive sound reacts to varying speeds.</p>Note
      that Digitrax only guarantees programming for Digitrax SFX
      decoders with properly installed loads, etc, but our testing
      has found that the PR3 will work with many common decoders.

      <h1>PR3 as a LocoNet Interface</h1>

      <p>When acting as an interface, the PR3 allows JMRI to
      interact with devices connected to LocoNet. This includes
      programming decoders on a programming track attached to a
      LocoNet command station. Where the LocoNet command station
      supports "programming on the main", JMRI is able to make use
      of that feature.</p>

      <p>The PR3 can also be used to connect JMRI to a <a href=
      "StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">"standalone LocoNet"</a>, which may
      be useful when LocoNet is used for some aspects of layout
      control while some other control system is use for other
      aspects. An example may be track occupancy detection and
      signaling using Digitrax BDL168 and SE8C boards while
      locomotive control is provided by a non-LocoNet DCC system.
      More information on this advanced topic is available on the
      <a href="StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">"Standalone LocoNet"</a>
      page.</p>

      <h2><a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/tsd/product/PR3/">Drivers</a></h2><a href="http://www.digitrax.com/tsd/product/PR3/">The
      PR3 needs to have a driver installed when used with Microsoft
      Windows. See the</a> <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/tsd/KB196/pr3-software-setup-for-microsoft-windows-xp/">
      Digitrax PR3 Windows Setup page</a> for more information.
      Make sure to follow the instructions exactly, particularly
      about the order of installing the drivers and plugging in the
      device.

      <p>See also <a href="#firmwareissue">PR3 Firmware issue which
      affects computers running Microsoft Windows</a> below.</p>

      <p>You don't need to install a separate driver when using
      current versions of Mac OS X or Linux.</p>

      <h2>Using the PR3 as a LocoNet Interface</h2><img src=
      "images/PR3toCommandStation.png" alt=
      "PR3 Connection to Digitrax Command Station">

      <p>To use the PR3 as an interface, connect a LocoNet cable to
      the LocoNet connector on the PR3. (Although not required,
      it's also OK to connect a power supply to the PR3). Finally,
      connect a USB cable between the PR3 and your computer.</p>

      <h3>Recommended setup as LocoNet interface</h3>

      <p>To set up a JMRI application to use the PR3 as an
      interface to a LocoNet which includes a LocoNet command
      station:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start the program.</li>

        <li>Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and
        configure the connection by:

          <ul>
            <li>Select LocoNet PR3</li>

            <li>Select the serial port that's connected to the
            PR3</li>

            <li>In the "<strong>Command Station</strong>" option,
            select the type of command station you've got on your
            LocoNet, e.g. "<code><strong>DCS100
            (Chief)</strong></code>", "<code><strong>DCS050
            (Zephyr)</strong></code>", etc.

              <p>The "Stand-alone LocoNet" option should be
              selected if you don't have a command station
              connected; see the <a href=
              "StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">"Standalone LocoNet"</a>
              page. In this case, the PR3 connection will not be
              able to program decoders.</p>
            </li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the speed will be fixed
            at 57,600 baud.</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the "Flow Control" option
            defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which is the
            preferred setting for the PR3. You should try that
            first, as it is the most reliable mode. Only if you
            can't reliably program decoders using that choice, and
            only after checking that you're using the right port,
            should you select "None" for this preference and try
            again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window,
        quit the program and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Using the PR3 Programming Track</h2><img src=
      "images/PR3standAlone.png" alt=
      "PR3 Connection to Programming Track">

      <p>To use the PR3 programming track, connect the PR3 to its
      power supply and to a dedicated piece of track which you'll
      use as the programming track. Finally, connect a USB cable
      between the PR3 and your computer.</p>

      <p>The PR3 does not necessarily provide reliable readback of
      CVs for some decoders, including many sound decoders, when
      the power supply is a 12VDC or 14VDC power supply. Some users
      repot that using a 18 VDC regulated power supply enables them
      to reliably read sound decoder CVs via the PR3 programming
      track. <strong>Do this at your own risk!</strong> <em>Current
      Digitrax documentation for the PR3 defines a maximum input
      voltage of 15 Volts DC, where previously the maximum voltage
      was listed as 20 Volts DC. Use of input voltages higher than
      15 Volts DC could damage the PR3 hardware.</em></p>

      <h3>Recommended setup as dedicated programming track</h3>

      <p>To set up a JMRI application to use the PR3 as a dedicated
      decoder programming track:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start DecoderPro.</li>

        <li>Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and
        configure the connection by:

          <ul>
            <li>Select LocoNet PR3</li>

            <li>Select the serial port that's connected to the
            PR3</li>

            <li>In the "<code>Command Station</code>" option,
            select "<code><strong>PR3 Standalone
            Programmer</strong></code>".</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the speed will be fixed
            at 57,600 baud.</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the "Flow Control" option
            defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which is the
            preferred setting for the PR3. You should try that
            first, as it is the most reliable mode. Only if you
            can't reliably program decoders using that choice, and
            only after checking that you're using the right port,
            should you select "None" for this preference and try
            again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window,
        quit the program and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Usage suggestions</h1>

      <p>You can use a JMRI throttle to control the locomotive
      connected to the PR3 Programmer. Use the JMRI Power Control
      or the "Power" menu item on the Throttle's menu bar to turn
      on track power, and then you can operate the locomotive
      normally.</p>

      <p>The PR3 can only provide very limited current, so Digitrax
      has built a "neutral mode" into their sound decoders. When
      JMRI and the PR3 is running a Digitrax sound decoder, the
      motor is disconnected to reduce the current load. You can
      still ramp the speed up and down with the throttle and listen
      to how the sound responds, but the motor won't move the
      locomotive.</p>

      <p>Other decoders, including decoders from other
      manufacturers, may draw enough motor current to trip the PR3
      internal circuit breakers. This will cause JMRI to mark track
      power as "off". Just wait a couple seconds and turn the track
      power back on to recover.</p>

      <h2>Using the PR3 programming track to program Non-Digitrax
      Decoders</h2>To implement that "neutral mode" described
      above, the PR3 automatically writes CV128 to 0 or 1. This
      happens when a JMRI throttle is used to run the locomotive on
      the PR3 programming track, and there's nothing JMRI can do to
      prevent it. Unfortunately, this can interfere with the CV
      programming on some non-Digitrax decoders. For example, it
      will set the "Master Volume" CV128 on some SoundTraxx
      decoders to a very low volume.

      <p>If you are using the PR3 with a decoder that uses CV128
      for something, you should either not use a JMRI throttle to
      run the locomotive on the PR3 programming track, or remember
      to rewrite CV128 with the right value just before removing
      the locomotive from the track.</p>

      <h1><a id="firmwareissue" name="firmwareissue">PR3 Firmware
      issue which affects computers running Microsoft
      Windows</a></h1>

      <p>Note that some PR3 devices do not behave well with JMRI
      when running on some versions of the Microsoft Windows
      computer operating systems. This problem has been seen by
      some some users of Windows 7 and Windows 8. These PR3s can
      cause erratic JMRI operation and can cause the JAVA
      interpreter to fail abnormally. Recovery from the issue may
      require re-starting JMRI or even require a true power-cycle
      for the computer, and this can resolve the problem until it
      happens again at some unpredictable future time. Note that a
      "hibernation" or "sleep" mode might not provide a temporary
      solution to the problem.</p>

      <p>Digitrax has provided a PR3 firmware update which seems to
      resolve this issue. It may be applied by the user.</p>

      <p>The appropriate update files and instructions are
      available from the "Download" page on the <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com">Digitrax</a> web site. Digitrax
      provides an application to apply the firmware update; the
      software package runs under Microsoft Operating Systems, and
      this is the <strong>strongly recommended</strong> way to
      apply the PR3 firmware update.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, <strong>although not recommended for this
      case</strong>, JMRI provides a tool which can be used to
      update the PR3 firmware. The JMRI tool is <strong>not
      recommended</strong> for this case because the failure could
      happen during the JMRI firmware update process. If the
      failure happens during the PR3 firmware update process, it is
      possible that the PR3 might require factory repair.</p>
