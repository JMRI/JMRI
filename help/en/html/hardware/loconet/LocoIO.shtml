      <h1>JMRI LocoIO Programmer Tools (deprecated)</h1>

      <p><strong>The standalone LocoIO Programmer tool is no longer
      supported. The preferred method to program a LocoIO board as
      of JMRI 3 is via <a href=
      "../../apps/DecoderPro/index.shtml">DecoderPro</a> with a
      dedicated decoder file.</strong><br>
      <em>The following entry is only shown as reference for JMRI
      versions before 3.0.</em></p>

      <p>JMRI contains a tool to simplify programming the LocoIO
      accessory input/output/controller board. This tool was
      greatly updated by John Plocher for JMRI release 1.8.</p>

      <p>The <a href="#curent">first section</a> of this page is
      John's description of the current LocoIO programmer. The
      <a href="#older">second part</a> of the page contains
      instructions for the older programmer, which is still
      available. <a name="current" id="current"></a></p>

      <h2>Using the second LocoIO Programmer</h2>

      <p>The second version <strong>(no longer supported)</strong>
      <em>only</em> dealt with SV1 &amp; SV2 (address/subaddress)
      and SV3-SV50 (primary mode, value1 and value2 for ports
      1-16). In particular, it did <em>not</em> address SV0 (board
      level configuration), SV51-SV98 (alternate Opcodes) or
      SV101-124 (servo config).</p>

      <p>Usage model:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Enter a LocoIO address and sub-address</li>

        <li>Click on "probe" button</li>

        <li>If a locoIO is found at that address, its firmware
        version is displayed (the Monitor LocoNet window will show
        all the LocoIO's that responded to the probe request if you
        need to refresh your memory)</li>

        <li>If you wish to change the address of a locoIO board,
        you MUST ensure that it is the ONLY LocoIO-based board
        connected to the LocoNet, as the address is set via a
        broadcast message. A popup will remind you of this. If you
        ignore it, then ALL of the LocoIO's on your LocoNet will be
        reprogrammed with the same new address.</li>

        <li>"read all" reads all the CV values from the LocoIO
        specified. "write all" writes them all out</li>

        <li>The individual read/write buttons do the same, but for
        only one port at a time.</li>

        <li>"capture" extracts the address out of the next turnout
        or occupancy sensor LocoNet message it sees and uses it as
        the address of the selected port.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- No longer supported, so no usage for a To Do list here -->
      <!-- <p>
To-Do list:
<ul>
<li>Need UI to configure the various SV0 states.

<li>Write a "change address" routine that takes both the
    old and new addresses and does the change without using a
    broadcast address.

<li>Write a set of config data out to a text file in the
    form used by Hans Deloofs standalone Windows programmer, and read it back when
    requested.
</ul>

      <h2>Using the first LocoIO Programmer</h2><a href=
      "images/locoio.gif"><img src="images/locoio.gif" width="100"
      height="50"></a>

      <p>There was an older LocoIO programmer, which is still
      available in JMRI. This section contains the instructions for
      that programmer.</p>

      <p>The programmer provides a table-based interface for
      configuring <a href=
      "http://www.locobuffer.com/LocoIO/LocoIO.htm">John Jabour's
      LocoIO board</a>, a powerful component for building CTC
      boards and control panels. (More information on the board is
      available at <a href=
      "http://www.locobuffer.com/LocoIO/LocoIO.htm">http://www.locobuffer.com/LocoIO/LocoIO.htm</a>)</p>

      <p>A LocoIO board has 16 signal pins, each of which can be
      programmed as an input or output, and to do a number of
      different things. The board is also sometimes described as
      having 16 channels.</p>

      <p>The channels are configured via LocoNet messages. The
      LocoIO programmer uses a table to represent the configuration
      of each channel.</p>

      <p>The "Action" column is used to select how the channel
      behaves. Click in a cell to be given a menu of available
      choices. Currently, the choices are:</p>

      <div class="list">
        <dl>
          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Toggle switch controls
          turnout"</dfn></dt>

          <dd class="first">
            <p>Generate a OPC_SW_REQ to close/throw a turnout when
            a toggle switch changes state. When the input goes
            high, a "close" command is sent; when the input goes
            low, a "throw" command is sent. The channel
            configuration value is 0x0F.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Input low flips
          turnout"</dfn></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Generate a OPC_SW_REQ LocoNet message when the input
            goes low. This is intended for use with a momentary
            pushbutton. The command sent will alternate the
            position of the addressed turnout or signal; if "close"
            was last sent, a "throw" will be sent now and
            vice-versa. The channel configuration value is
            0x2F.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Input high flips
          turnout"</dfn></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Generate a OPC_SW_REQ LocoNet message when the input
            goes high. This is intended for use with a momentary
            pushbutton. The command sent will alternate the
            position of the addressed turnout or signal; if "close"
            was last sent, a "throw" will be sent now and
            vice-versa. The channel configuration value is
            0x6F.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Status message sets
          output"</dfn></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Drive an output from OPC_INPUT_REP input status
            messages on the LocoNet. The output goes high when an
            "input high" message is received, and goes low when an
            "input low" message is received. These messages are
            also used for block occupancy status; the output will
            go high when the block is occupied, and low when its
            empty. The channel configuration value is 0XC0.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Turnout close cmd sets
          output"</dfn></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Drive an output on the LocoIO board from received
            OPC_SW_REQ commands. The channel configuration value is
            0x80. This adjusts the address field to look for a
            command that sets the turnout "closed".</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Turnout throw cmd sets
          output"</dfn></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Drive an output on the LocoIO board from received
            OPC_SW_REQ commands. The channel configuration value is
            0x80. This adjusts the address field to look for a
            command that sets the turnout "thrown".</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>

      <p>The "Hex Value1,Value2" column sets the address that the
      LocoIO board will use for LocoNet communications. This
      contains a hexadecimal representation of the two
      configuration values described in John Jabour's LocoIO
      programming guide. You generally won't need to figure out
      these addresses, as the <span class="button">capture</span>
      buttons will find them for you.</p>

      <p>We're also planning to have a "User Address" column that
      will show the human-readable address for turnouts and
      sensors. For turnout messages, this is the same number that
      you would use on your throttle. For block occupancy messages,
      this is the block number. For input status messages, this is
      the input number, which is twice the number of the associated
      turnout, plus one if its a DS54 "switch" input.</p>

      <p>The <span class="button">Read</span> button reads from the
      LocoIO board via the LocoNet and shows the current
      configuration for that pin. The <span class=
      "button">Write</span> button stores the current settings to
      the LocoIO board.</p>

      <p>The <span class="button">Capture</span> button provides an
      easier way to find a needed LocoNet address. Configure the
      input and output for a particular pin, then press the
      <span class="button">Capture</span> button. The address in
      the next LocoNet message of the right type will be put in the
      address column.</p>

      <p>For example, if you have a channel set to act when a
      "Turnout closed status message" is received, press the
      <span class="button">Capture</span> button and use your
      throttle to command the correct turnout Closed.</p>

      <p>As another example, if the channel is configured to send a
      "Send throw turnout command", press the <span class=
      "button">Capture</span> button and use your throttle to
      command the correct turnout Thrown.</p>

      <p>At the bottom of the table are some general controls. The
      LocoIO address field sets the address of the board being
      programmed. LocoIO processors are sent with an address of
      1051 programmed; see below for how to change that. Address
      "0" is a global address which any LocoIO board will respond
      to; make sure you have only one connected when you use
      that!</p>

      <p>The <span class="button">Set address</span> button will
      use the global address to configure a specific address into a
      LocoIO board. Again, make sure you have only one connected
      (This button is disabled in the current version while we sort
      out a problem).</p>

      <p>The <span class="button">Open...</span> and <span class=
      "button">Save...</span> buttons are not yet implemented. They
      will eventually allow you to load and store configuration
      files.</p>

      <p>The <span class="button">Read All</span> and <span class=
      "button">Write All</span> buttons read or write all of the
      channels, and are just a convenience.</p>

      <p>Status messages during capture/read/write are displayed at
      the bottom of the window. If no response is heard from the
      LocoIO unit, the operation will be retried until it succeeds
      or until you close the window.</p>
