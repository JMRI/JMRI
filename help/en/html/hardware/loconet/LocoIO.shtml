      <h1>JMRI LocoIO Programmer</h1>

      <p>The <strong>preferred method to program a LocoIO board</strong> since
      JMRI 3 is using <a href="../../apps/DecoderPro/index.shtml">DecoderPro</a> with the
      dedicated <a href=
      "../../../../../xml/decoders/Public_Domain_HDL_LocoIO.xml">Public_Domain_HDL_LocoIO</a> Decoder
      Definition. See full instructions <a href="#current">below</a>.</p>

      <p>A LocoIO board is a DIY stationary interface to LocoNet for inputs (fascia pushbuttons, turnout feedback or
      occupancy sensors) and outputs (fascia indicator LEDs, signal LED's, turnout motors etc.). The original <a href=
      "http://www.locobuffer.com/LocoIO/LocoIO.htm">LocoIO</a>
      design by John Jabour was further developed by <a href="http://users.telenet.be/deloof/">Hans Deloof</a> from
      Belgium.<br>
      A typical board contains 16 signal pins, also called channels or ports. Each port can be individually programmed
      as an input or an output, and to perform a number of different things (depending on the module's hardware and
      firmware (PIC) version:</p>

      <p>Inputs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Block Detector - Active Low</li>
        <li>Block Detector - Active High</li>
        <li>Block Detector - Active Low - Delayed</li>
        <li>Block Detector - Active High - Delayed</li>
        <li>Push Button - Active Low</li>
        <li>Push Button - Active Low - Indirect</li>
        <li>Switch Point Feedback - Normal</li>
        <li>Switch Point Feedback - Contact 2</li>
        <li>Switch Point Feedback - Contact 1</li>
        <li>Push Button - Active High - Indirect</li>
        <li>Push Button - Active High</li>
        <li>Toggle Switch</li>
        <li>Toggle Switch - Indirect</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Outputs</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed - 1 - Off</li>
        <li>Fixed - 2 - Off</li>
        <li>Fixed - 1 - On</li>
        <li>Fixed - 2 - On</li>
        <li>Pulse - 2 - Soft Reset</li>
        <li>Pulse - 1 - Soft Reset</li>
        <li>Pulse - 2 - Hard Reset</li>
        <li>Pulse - 1 - Hard Reset</li>
        <li>Fixed - 1 - Off - Blink</li>
        <li>Fixed - 2 - Off - Blink</li>
        <li>Fixed - 1 - On - Blink</li>
        <li>Fixed - 2 - On - Blink</li>
        <li>Fixed - 1 - Off - 4-Way</li>
        <li>Fixed - 1 - Off - 4-Way - Blink</li>
        <li>Fixed - 2 - Off - 4-Way</li>
        <li>Fixed - 2 - Off - 4-Way - Blink</li>
        <li>Fixed - 1 - On - 4-Way</li>
        <li>Fixed - 1 - On - 4-Way - Blink</li>
        <li>Fixed - 2 - On - 4-Way</li>
        <li>Fixed - 2 - On - 4-Way - Blink</li>
        <li>Block (Occupancy) Detector</li>
        <li>Block Detector - Blink</li>
        <li>Servo (LocoServo ports 5-12 only)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since LocoIO rev 1.49</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Port Not In Use</li>
        <li>On older boards, you are advised to configure unused ports as Output Fixed to prevent accidental
          signals</li>
      </ul>
      <p>See the Cheat Sheet included in the DecoderPro LocoIO Programmer for further details.</p>

      <p>The ports are configured via LocoNet messages, but the DecoderPro Programming
      interface takes care of many technical details. Documentation is included below and
      in the decoder definition file.</p>

      <h2>LocoIO Programmer via Roster</h2>
      <span class="since">Since
      <a href="https://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri4.21.2.shtml" target="_blank">JMRI 4.21.2</a></span>
      <p>The <a href=
      "../../../../../xml/decoders/Public_Domain_HDL_LocoIO.xml">Public_Domain_HDL_LocoIO</a> Decoder
      Definition in the "Public Domain and DIY" category supports set-up of a wide range of LocoIO
      devices up to LocoIO/LocoBooster/LocoRCD/LocoServo rev 1.54 hardware since 2020.

      <p>To use the current LocoIO Programmer follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Turn on the layout and power up the LocoIO hardware. No jumpers or buttons on the LocoIO need touching in
          order to preceed.</li>
        <li>Open DecoderPro or the Roster menu option in PanelPro.</li>
        <li>In the Decoder Installed box, navigate to
          "Public-domain and DIY" &gt; "Hans Deloof LocoIO".</li>
        <li>Looking at your hardware, select the correct PIC programmer firmware version from the list. It often is
          labeled on the biggest IC chip. If your version is not in the list, select the first higher one. In this
          example we pick "LocoIO v1.53":<br>
          <a href="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create1_New.png"><img
          src="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create1_New.png"
          width="370" height="235" alt="Screenshot LocoIO Config step 1"></a>
        </li>
        <li>On the right of the Create New Loco pane, enter a name for this module, eg. "LocoIO 81/1 rev 1.53", and
        fix the ultra-long decoder DCC address suggested. We chose 81, the factory default board address:<br>
        <a href="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create2_Correct.png"><img
        src="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create2_Correct.png"
        width="370" height="235" alt="Screenshot LocoIO Config step 2"></a><br>
        Click [Save] and close the Create New Loco pane.</li>

        <li>You will see the new entry appear in the Roster.<br>
        Select it, make sure to select Programming on Main, and click [Program]:<br>
        <a href="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create3_POM.png"><img
        src="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create3_POM.png"
        width="294" height="230" alt="Screenshot LocoIO Config step 3"></a>
        </li>

        <li>On the Basic tab, enter the actual LocoIO Main Address and Sub-address, "81" and "1" respectively in our
        example:<br>
        <a href="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create4_CheckAddress.png"><img
        src="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create4_CheckAddress.png"
        width="343" height="261" alt="Screenshot LocoIO Config step 4"></a>
        </li>

        <li>Next, go to the Roster Entry pane, click [Save to Roster] and close &amp; reopen the LocoIO
          definition from the Roster to update the actual decoder address:<br>
          <a href="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create5_SaveClose.png"><img
          src="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create5_SaveClose.png"
          width="343" height="261" alt="Screenshot LocoIO Config step 5"></a>
        </li>

        <li>Returning to the Basic tab, click [Read full sheet]. If a LocoIO is found at the address, its firmware
        version is displayed (the Monitor LocoNet window will show more precise information regarding the firmware).</li>

        <li><strong>Warning:</strong> If you wish to change the address of a LocoIO board,
        you <strong>MUST first ensure that ONLY a single LocoIO-based board is
        connected to the LocoNet</strong>, as the address is set via a broadcast message.<br>
        If you Write CV2 and CV3 on the CVs tab or press [Write All] from the Basic tab, <strong>ALL</strong>
        LocoIO's on your LocoNet will be reprogrammed with the same new address.
        </li>

        </li>

        <li>After Read All, many ports will show a Mode selected. Due to the complexity of the LocoIO memory
          DecoderPro can't figure out some choices, so you will have to assist at this point for those ports that still
          show "Port not in Use". At least you will notice the numbers already changed.
          For example on Port 4 the number in the Config field reads "95":<br>
          <a href="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create9a_Port4Combo.png"><img
          src="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create9a_Port4Combo.png"
          width="405" height="130" alt="Screenshot LocoIO Config step 9a"></a>
        </li>

        <li>Turn to the Cheat Sheet tab reference, in the Config column look up "95". It's is a Block Detector -
          Active High:<br>
          <a href="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create9b_CheatSheet.png"><img
          src="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create9b_CheatSheet.png"
          width="274" height="195" alt="Screenshot LocoIO Config step 9b"></a>
        </li>

        <li>Return to the Ports tab and in the Port 4 Mode combo, pick "Block Detector - Active High" (either odd or even
          address, will correct automatically later on):<br>
          <a href="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create9c_Port4ComboOpen.png"><img
          src="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create9c_Port4ComboOpen.png"
          width="425" height="130" alt="Screenshot LocoIO Config step 9c"></a>
        </li>

        <li>After clicking [Read changes on sheet]:<br>
          <a href="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create9d_Port4ModeSet.png"><img
          src="images/LocoIoDefinition/Create9d_Port4ModeSet.png"
          width="427" height="126" alt="Screenshot LocoIO Config step 9d"></a>
        </li>

        <li>After fixing all mode combo's that are not "0", once again click [Read full sheet] to update all fields
          and inspect the LocoIO configuration. Scroll down to see more ports:<br>

          width="564" height="442" alt="Screenshot LocoIO Config step 10"></a>
        </li>

        <li>Inputs allow setting up to two more actions carried out when the pin goes to ON. You can set the action
          type and the address on the right hand side of the LocoIO programmer pane as shown here. See the HDL
          documentation for examples and further information:<br>

      <a href="images/LocoIO_v2.png"><img src="images/LocoIO_v2.png"
      width="397" height="305" alt="Screenshot of LocoIO Configuration Tool
      v2 (deprecated)"></a>
      <p><em>The following entry is only shown as reference for JMRI
      versions before 3.0.</em></p>
      <p>You can still use it for the original boards, but consider
      switching over to configuring your LocoIO boards with the current
      programmer, documented <a href="#current">above</a>.</p>
      <p>Version 2 was written by John Plocher for JMRI release 1.8 and
      <em>only</em> dealt with SV1 &amp; SV2 (address/subaddress)
      and SV3-SV50 (primary Mode, Value1 and Value2 for ports
      1-16). In particular, it did not handle SV0 (board
      level configuration), SV51-SV98 (alternate Opcodes) or
      SV101-124 (servo config).</p>

      <p>Available options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter the LocoIO board address as hex value (example: 0x51 =
        81 decimal)</li>
        <li>Click on "Probe" button.If a locoIO is found at that address,
        its firmware version is displayed (the Monitor LocoNet window
        will show all the LocoIO's that responded to the probe request
        if you need to refresh your memory)</li>
        <li>Select a port operation mode from the drop down list</li>
        <li>"Read All" reads all the CV values from the LocoIO
        specified. "Write All" writes them all out</li>
        <li>The individual read/write buttons do the same, but for
        only one port at a time.</li>
        <li>"Capture" extracts the address out of the next turnout
        or occupancy sensor LocoNet message it sees and uses it as
        the address of the selected port.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>LocoIO Programmer 1 <strong>(no longer supported)</strong></h2><a href=
      "images/locoio.gif"><img src="images/locoio.gif" width="346"
      height="162" alt="Screenshot of LocoIO Configuration Tool v1
      (deprecated)"></a>

      <p>The first LocoIO programmer was part of JMRI 1.x.
      It provided a table-based interface for configuring <a href=
      "http://www.locobuffer.com/LocoIO/LocoIO.htm">John Jabour's
      LocoIO board</a>, a powerful component for building CTC
      boards and control panels. (More information on the board is
      available at
      <a href="http://www.locobuffer.com/LocoIO/LocoIO.htm"
      >http://www.locobuffer.com/LocoIO/LocoIO.htm</a>)</p>

      <p>The LocoIO programmer v1 used a table to represent the
      configuration of each channel.</p>

      <p>The "Action" column is used to select how the channel/port
      behaves. Click in a cell to be given a menu of available
      choices. Currently, the choices are:</p>

      <div class="list">
        <dl>
          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Toggle switch controls
          turnout"</dfn></dt>

          <dd class="first">
            <p>Generate a OPC_SW_REQ to close/throw a turnout when
            a toggle switch changes state. When the input goes
            high, a "close" command is sent; when the input goes
            low, a "throw" command is sent. The channel
            configuration value is 0x0F.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Input low flips
          turnout"</dfn></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Generate a OPC_SW_REQ LocoNet message when the input
            goes low. This is intended for use with a momentary
            pushbutton. The command sent will alternate the
            position of the addressed turnout or signal; if "close"
            was last sent, a "throw" will be sent now and
            vice-versa. The channel configuration value is
            0x2F.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Input high flips
          turnout"</dfn></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Generate a OPC_SW_REQ LocoNet message when the input
            goes high. This is intended for use with a momentary
            pushbutton. The command sent will alternate the
            position of the addressed turnout or signal; if "close"
            was last sent, a "throw" will be sent now and
            vice-versa. The channel configuration value is
            0x6F.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Status message sets
          output"</dfn></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Drive an output from OPC_INPUT_REP input status
            messages on the LocoNet. The output goes high when an
            "input high" message is received, and goes low when an
            "input low" message is received. These messages are
            also used for block occupancy status; the output will
            go high when the block is occupied, and low when its
            empty. The channel configuration value is 0XC0.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Turnout close cmd sets
          output"</dfn></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Drive an output on the LocoIO board from received
            OPC_SW_REQ commands. The channel configuration value is
            0x80. This adjusts the address field to look for a
            command that sets the turnout "closed".</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="left"><dfn>"Turnout throw cmd sets
          output"</dfn></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Drive an output on the LocoIO board from received
            OPC_SW_REQ commands. The channel configuration value is
            0x80. This adjusts the address field to look for a
            command that sets the turnout "thrown".</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>

      <p>The "Hex Value1,Value2" column sets the address that the
      LocoIO board will use for LocoNet communications. This
      contains a hexadecimal representation of the two
      configuration values described in John Jabour's LocoIO
      programming guide. You generally won't need to figure out
      these addresses, as the <span class="button">capture</span>
      buttons will find them for you.</p>

      <p>The <span class="button">Read</span> button reads from the
      LocoIO board via the LocoNet and shows the current
      configuration for that pin. The <span class=
      "button">Write</span> button stores the current settings to
      the LocoIO board.</p>

      <p>The <span class="button">Capture</span> button provides an
      easier way to find a needed LocoNet address. Configure the
      input and output for a particular pin, then press the
      <span class="button">Capture</span> button. The address in
      the next LocoNet message of the right type will be put in the
      address column.</p>

      <p>For example, if you have a channel set to act when a
      "Turnout closed status message" is received, press the
      <span class="button">Capture</span> button and use your
      throttle to command the correct turnout Closed.</p>

      <p>As another example, if the channel is configured to send a
      "Send throw turnout command", press the <span class=
      "button">Capture</span> button and use your throttle to
      command the correct turnout Thrown.</p>

      <p>At the bottom of the table are some general controls. The
      LocoIO address field sets the address of the board being
      programmed. LocoIO processors are sent with an address of
      1051 programmed; see below for how to change that. Address
      "0" is a global address which any LocoIO board will respond
      to; make sure you have only one connected when you use
      that!</p>

      <p>The <span class="button">Set address</span> button will
      use the global address to configure a specific address into a
      LocoIO board. Again, make sure you have only one connected.</p>

      <p>The <span class="button">Read All</span> and <span class=
      "button">Write All</span> buttons read or write all of the
      channels, and are just a convenience.</p>

      <p>Status messages during capture/read/write are displayed at
      the bottom of the window. If no response is heard from the
      LocoIO unit, the operation will be retried until it succeeds
      or until you close the window.</p>
