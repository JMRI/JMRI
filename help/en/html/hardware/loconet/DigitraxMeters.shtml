      <h1 id="Introduction">Introduction to JMRI Volt and Current Meters with Digitrax
      Hardware</h1>

      <p>Under certain configurations, JMRI provides a "Voltage/Current Meter" tool under the
      "Tools" menu item. This tool may be used to display information reported by certain Digitrax
      hardware.</p>

      <p>The Voltage/Current Meter tool can report voltage or current data from any LocoNet device
      which reports voltage and current information using special Loconet messages. In order to
      help differentiate the possible sources, each source's data is identified by a name which
      includes the device type and the device serial number. Each is individually selectable in the
      Voltage/Current Meter tool.</p>

      <p>It is helpful to re-configure the Voltage/Current Meter tool's "Settings" for displaying
      "2 integer digits" and "1 decimal digit". This matches the tool's display to the precision of
      the data reported on LocoNet.</p>

      <p>Note that the current reported by modern Digitrax boosters and command stations tends to
      be the "power input" current, not the "DCC Track Current". See <a href=
      "#Limitations_Current">Limitations</a>, below.</p>

      <h1 id="SupportedHardware">Hardware which supports Digitrax "Meters"</h1>

      <p>The JMRI's LocoNet functionality supports the voltage and current reporting from the
      following Digitrax devices:</p>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="3">** It is suspected that these devices report voltage and current data
          that is compatible with this tool, but this has not yet been confirmed.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Other Digitrax devices which include the appropriate capabilities are automatically
      supported. However, where a specific device type is not understood by JMRI, the associated
      voltage meter and current meter data will be available, via names which include a device
      number instead of a device name.</p>

      <h1 id="Limitations">Limitations</h1>

      <p>The LocoNet implementation which supports reporting of voltage and current has the
      following limitations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The JMRI implementation of voltage and current measurement capabilities applies to
        those devices which support "Query Mode" reporting of voltage and current mesurements.</li>

        <li>At least some versions of DCS210+ command stations seem to have problems in reporting
        reliable data.</li>

        <li>Proper reporting of voltage and current measurements may only be available with certain
        firmware versions. Be sure to update your LocoNet device firmware to help ensure proper
        measurement reporting.</li>

        <li>When displaying LocoNet-reported Voltage and/or Current values, the tools will
        generally receive new data about every 30 seconds.</li>

        <li>
          <a id="Limitations_Current">While the tool linked in the "Tools" menu calls one tool
          "Track Current"</a>, the LocoNet implementation does not report DCC track current
          exactly. Instead, the LocoNet implementation reports the "input power's current
          consumption". This will generally be the DCC track current plus some "overhead" current
          which is consumed by the command station circuitry.
        </li>

        <li>The LocoNet implementation relies upon the information reported by the "Query Mode"
        reporting of "Vtrk" (for the data used by the "Track Voltage" tool) and "Query Mode"
        reporting of "Iin" (for the data used by the "Track Current" tool).</li>
      </ul>
