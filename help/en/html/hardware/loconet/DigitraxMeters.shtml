      Introduction to JMRI Volt and Current Meters with Digitrax Hardware</a></h1>

      <p>Under certain configurations, JMRI provides tools under the "Tools" menu
          item which may display "Track Voltage" and "Track Current" tools.  When
          a LocoNet connection is defined and that connection is defined to use
          any of certain Digitrax command stations, JMRI provides those tools.  When
          a LocoNet connection is defined without a command station, or with 
          any of the un-supported command stations, those tools will not be 
          available. Those tools may also be available when a non-LocoNet connection
          is defined and that connection type supports reporting of voltage and/or
          current.</p>
      <p>Note that "Track Current" is not necessarily a correct description of the
          information that Digitrax command stations can provide.  See <a href="#Limitations_Current">Limitations</a>,
          below.</p>
      
      <h1><a id="SupportedHardware" name="SupportedHardware">Hardware which supports Digitrax "Meters"</a></h1>
      <p>The JMRI's LocoNet functionality supports the voltage and current reporting
          from the following Digitrax command stations:</p>
      <ul><li>DCS240</li><li>DCS210</li><li>DCS52</li></ul>
      <p>Other Digitrax devices may be added to this list as the appropriate 
          capabilities become available, both in hardware and in JMRI capabilities.</p>
      <h1><a id="Limitations" name="Limitations">Limitations</a></h1>
      <p>The LocoNet implementation which supports reporting of voltage and 
          current has the following limitations:
      <ul>
          <li>The JMRI implementation of voltage and current measurement capabilities
              applies only to the DCS240, DCS210, and DCS52.</li>
          <li>Proper reporting of voltage and current measurements may only be 
              available with certain command station firmware versions.  Be sure 
              to update your command station firmware to help ensure proper 
              measurement reporting.</li>
          <li>When displaying LocoNet-reported Voltage and/or Current values, the
              tools will generally receive new data about every 30 seconds.</li>
          <li>If multiple DCS240s, DCS210s, and/or DCS52s are connected to the
              connection's LocoNet, they will all reply to the LocoNet query for 
              updated information.  The last one of these to report its measurements
              will be reflected on the display.</li>
          <li><a id="Limitations_Current" name="Limitations_Current">While the tool 
              linked in the "Tools" menu calls one tool "Track Current"</a>, 
              the LocoNet implementation does not report DCC track current exactly.  
              Instead, the LocoNet implementation reports the "input power's current 
              consumption".  This will generally be the DCC track current plus some 
              "overhead" current which is consumed by the command station circuitry.</li>
          <li>The LocoNet implementation relies upon the information reported by 
              the "Query Mode" reporting of "Vtrk" (for the data used by the "Track 
              Voltage" tool) and "Query Mode" reporting of "Iin" (for the data used
              by the "Track Current" tool).</li>
          <li>While other devices, including some Digitrax booster models, are able to provide
              "Query Mode" data, the LocoNet implementation which provides 
              information to the "Track Voltage" and "Track Current" tools ignores 
              those responses.  This is because those tools do not have any 
              provisions for handling multiple sources of voltage and current data.</li>
