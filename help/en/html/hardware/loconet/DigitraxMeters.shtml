      Introduction to JMRI Volt and Current Meters with Digitrax Hardware</a></h1>

      <p>Under certain configurations, JMRI provides a "Voltage/Current Meter" tool 
          under the "Tools" menu item.  This tool may be used to display information
          reported by certain Digitrax hardware.</p>
      <p>The Voltage/Current Meter tool can report voltage or current data from
          any LocoNet device which reports voltage and current information using
          special Loconet messages.  In order to help differentiate the possible
          sources, each source's data is identified by a name which includes the
          device type and the device serial number.  Each is individually selectable
          in the Voltage/Current Meter tool.</p>
      <p>It is helpful to re-configure the Voltage/Current Meter tool's "Settings"
          for displaying "2 integer digits" and "1 decimal digit".  This matches
          the tool's display to the precision of the data reported on LocoNet.</p>
      <p>Note that the current reported by modern Digitrax boosters and command
          stations tends to be the "power input" current, not the "DCC Track 
          Current".  See <a href="#Limitations_Current">Limitations</a>,
          below.</p>
      
      <h1><a id="SupportedHardware" name="SupportedHardware">Hardware which supports Digitrax "Meters"</a></h1>
      <p>The JMRI's LocoNet functionality supports the voltage and current reporting
          from the following Digitrax devices:</p>
      <table border='2'>
          <tr><td><strong>Device</strong<td>
              <td><strong>Typical "name" of voltage meter</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Typical "name" of current meter</strong></td></tr>

          <tr><td colspan="3">* At least some DCS210+ devices report inconsistent data.</td></tr>
          <tr><td colspan="3">** It is suspected that these devices report voltage 
                  and current data that is compatible with this tool, but this

      </table>
      <p>Other Digitrax devices which include the appropriate capabilities are
          automatically supported.  However, where a specific device type is not 
          understood by JMRI, the associated voltage meter and current meter data
          will be available, via names which include a device number instead of
          a device name.</p>
      <h1><a id="Limitations" name="Limitations">Limitations</a></h1>
      <p>The LocoNet implementation which supports reporting of voltage and 
          current has the following limitations:
      <ul>
          <li>The JMRI implementation of voltage and current measurement capabilities
              applies to those devices which support "Query Mode" reporting of
              voltage and current mesurements.</li>
          <li>At least some versions of DCS210+ command stations seem to have 
              problems in reporting reliable data.</li>
          <li>Proper reporting of voltage and current measurements may only be 
              available with certain firmware versions.  Be sure to update your 
              LocoNet device firmware to help ensure proper measurement reporting.</li>
          <li>When displaying LocoNet-reported Voltage and/or Current values, the
              tools will generally receive new data about every 30 seconds.</li>
          <li><a id="Limitations_Current" name="Limitations_Current">While the tool 
              linked in the "Tools" menu calls one tool "Track Current"</a>, 
              the LocoNet implementation does not report DCC track current exactly.  
              Instead, the LocoNet implementation reports the "input power's current 
              consumption".  This will generally be the DCC track current plus some 
              "overhead" current which is consumed by the command station circuitry.</li>
          <li>The LocoNet implementation relies upon the information reported by 
              the "Query Mode" reporting of "Vtrk" (for the data used by the "Track 
              Voltage" tool) and "Query Mode" reporting of "Iin" (for the data used
              by the "Track Current" tool).</li>
