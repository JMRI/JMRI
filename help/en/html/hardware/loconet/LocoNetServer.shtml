      <h1>Hardware Support: Connecting Multiple Computers to
      LocoNet&reg; via JMRI LocoNet Server</h1>
      <p>This page describes how to use the inbuilt LocoNet&reg;
      Client/Server capability of JMRI to connect multiple
      computers to a single LocoNet-equipped layout.</p>

      <p>Briefly, one computer is physically connected to the
      LocoNet, and acts as a "Server" for others. One or more
      "Client" computers can then connect via standard TCP/IP
      protocols to the Server.</p>

      <h2>Setup for JMRI LocoNet Client/Server</h2>One computer
      running JMRI acts as the Server, which is directly connected
      to the LocoNet, the other computers running JMRI connect to
      the Server computer as Clients.

      <ul>
        <li>Configure the LocoNet connection just like for any
        other use. Select the protocol that corresponds to your
        hardware (e.g. <a href="LocoBufferII">LocoBuffer-II</a>,
        etc), the communication port, and other options. It's
        best to make sure this is working well before
        proceeding.</li>

        <li>You can then manually start the server by selecting
        "Start LocoNet Server" from the LocoNet menu. This will
        allow other computers to connect to the layout until you
        stop the program; the next time you start it, you'll have
        to do this again.</li>

        <li>You can also have the server start automatically every
        time you start the program by

        <ul>
          <li>Open the Preferences from the Edit menu (on Windows
          or Linux) or from the Application menu (OS X)</li>

          <li>Under "Start Up", click "Add &#9662;"</li>

          <li>Select "Perform action..."</li>

          <li>Find and select "Start LocoNet Server" and click
          "OK"</li>

          <li>Save the preferences.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The program in the Client computer can then be configured
      to connect to the layout via the LocoNet Server by:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Make sure the Server computer is running the LocoNet
        server</li>

        <li>Open the program on the Client computer</li>

        <li>Open the preferences from the Edit menu</li>

        <li>For layout connection, select "LocoNet Server"</li>

        <li>In the "Server hostname" box that appears, type the
        Internet name or address of the computer that's running the
        LocoNet Server. An internet address is something like
        127.0.1.12; a name is something like jmri.org</li>

        <li>Save the preferences and restart the program.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Notes:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>It's strongly recommended that you connect the master
        computer to the LocoNet with a LocoBuffer or LocoBuffer-II.
        Although a MS-100 will basically work for this application,
        correction of the resulting occasional LocoNet errors may
        cause noticeable delays in updating the remote
        computers.</li>

        <li>If the computers are all close to the LocoNet, e.g.
        acting as local control panels, you don't really need
        LocoNet Server to do this. You can instead connect each of
        the computers to the LocoNet via their own LocoBuffer or
        LocoBuffer-II (or MS-100, though this is not recommended)
        and have them individually take part in the LocoNet
        communications. This doesn't cause any additional
        communications load. It does cost a little more for the
        extra adapters, and doesn't permit you to put a computer
        remote from the layout.</li>
      </ul>
