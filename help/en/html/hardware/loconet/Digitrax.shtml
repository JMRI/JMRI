	<h2>Supported Command Stations</h2>
	<p>DecoderPro works with your Digitrax command station to program
	decoders.  To do this, it communicates with the command station
	over the LocoNet using one of several types of LocoNet adapter.</p>
	<P>DecoderPro will work with all the following command stations:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Zephyr Starter Set</li>
	  <li>Super Empire Builder Set</li>
	  <li>Super Chief Set</li>
	  <li>DCS50 Command Station/Booster/Throttle </li>
	  <li>DB150 Command Station/Booster</li>
	  <li>DCS100 Command Station/Booster</li>
	  <li>DCS200 Command Station/Booster</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.uhlenbrock.de/3/index.htm">Intellibox: The Uhlenbrock Central Unit</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <P>To connect your computer to the LocoNet, and hence to the command
    station, you need one of the following adapters:</P>
	  <li><a href="LocoBufferUSB.shtml">LocoBuffer-USB</a></li>
	  <li><a href="LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer II</a></li>
	  <li><a href="LocoBuffer.shtml">LocoBuffer</a></li>
	  <li><a href="MS100.shtml">MS-100</a></li>
	</ul>
	<P>Generally, any of these can be used with any type of computer
	to communicate with any type of command station.  It is strongly
	recommended, however, that you use a LocoBuffer-style device in preference 
	to an MS100.  The MS100 does not provide reliable communications,
	and cannot be used at all if your computer is a Macintosh running
	MacOS X.
	
	<p>
	DecoderPro can also use a 
	<a href="PR2.shtml">Digitrax PR2</a> to program and test decoders.
	The PR2 is a stand-alone unit which does not connect to the 
	rest of the layout, the command station, nor to a LocoNet.
	For more information on using a PR2 with DecoderPro, please
	see the
	<a href="PR2.shtml">PR2 setup page</a>.
	
	<h2>Setup</h2>

	  <p>To connect your computer to a Digitrax DCC system, you need a
	  <a href="LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer II</a>,
	  <a href="LocoBuffer.shtml">LocoBuffer</a> or
	  <a href="MS100.shtml">MS-100</a> to act as an adapter.
      See below for more
	  information on these.  The LocoBuffer II is highly recommended.</p>

	  <P> Note that these are LocoNet interfaces, not standalone
	  programmers like the Digitrax PR1.  Neither of them will let you
	  read CVs if you have an Empire Builder!  For that you need a
	  Chief or Zephyr command station.  (We're working on PR1 support,
	  and would welcome help).</p>
	  	  
	  <ol>
	  <li>Connect
	  your adapter to the LocoNet, and connect your
	  computer to it with the appropriate serial cable.</li>

	  <li> Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.
	  This opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you
	  can select it from the "Edit" menu.  </li>

	  <li> Select "Digitrax MS100" or "Digitrax LocoBuffer" from the top
	  selection box. You can then select the proper serial port in the
	  second selection box.  </li>

	  <li> The baud rate box will be fixed if you've selected an MS100.
	  There are two choices for the LocoBuffer; select the one the
	  corresponds to the jumper settings on the LocoBuffer board. We
	  recommend that you start with the 19,200 choice for the
	  LocoBuffer and LocoBuffer II;
	  see the
	  <a href="LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer II</a> and
	  <a href="LocoBuffer.shtml">LocoBuffer</a>
	  pages	for more information.</li>

	  <li> The fourth box should be left on "hardware flow control"
	  unless you later consistently get a message about the LocoBuffer
	  control leads being improperly set up, in which case you might
	  want to try to bypass that by selecting "no flow control".  This
	  box will be blank if you've selected MS100.</li>

	  <li> In the fifth box, select the type of command station you
	  have.  Note that this program can't read decoder CVs if you have
	  an Empire Builder (DB150); that's due to the Empire Builder
	  hardware, and there's nothing we can do about it.</li>

	  <li> The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you
	  to select how the program will look.  "Metal" is the native Java
	  look available on all types.  Other choices will vary with your
	  computer type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive"
	  look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X
	  respectively.</li>

	  <li> In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default
	  programmer format. You can override this each time you open the
	  programmer, so this is here just for convenience.</li>

	  <li> Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
	  quit, click "Yes".</li>

	  <li> Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>
	  </ol>
    <P>
    If you are going to control turnouts, signals or other devices
    on your layout from JMRI or another program, we recommend
    that you set the command station's "Meter Switch Commands"
    option off.  When on, this option greatly reduces the number 
    of commands the LocoNet can handle each second, which can cause
    significant delays when you're controlling signals, etc. To turn
    it off, you can use the "Configure Command Station" tool in the LocoNet
    menu to set Option Switch 31 to "T" (thrown), or set it
    directly in the command station using a Digitrax throttle.
    
    <h2>Network Connections</h2>
    There are several methods available to connect multiple 
    computers to a single LocoNet.  These communicate
    via standard TCP/IP protocols, and can even work 
    remotely.
    <A HREF="LocoNetworking.shtml">For more information ...</a>

	<h2>Limitations</h2>
	<P><b>PR-1 not currently supported</b> - Note that DecoderPro
	cannot directly program decoders via a PR1 programmer.  You have to
	use one of the command stations above.</p>

	<P><b>MacOS X and the MS100</b> - Because MacOS X can't communicate
	at the special baud rate used by the MS100, the MS100 won't work 
	with MacOS X.  You should get a LocoBufffer II instead.
	
	<p><b>Serial ports on older Macintoshes and the MS100</B> - 
	A standard Macintosh RS422 serial port will not work directly with
	an MS100. Since it doesn't have two output status lines (DTR and
	RTS), it can't provide correct power to the MS100.  It may be
	possible to provide external power; if you're interested in trying
	this, we'd be happy to help work out a solution. A LocoBuffer will
	work fine with a standard Macintosh RS422 serial port.</p>

	<P><b>Apple USB connections</B> -
	  DecoderPro is tested with both a MS100 and a LocoBuffer on a
	  USB Macintosh using a Keyspan PDA Adapter to provide the serial
	  port; for information please see <a
	  href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/DigiTrax/KeyspanAdapters/KeyspanUSB.shtml">http://jmri.sourceforge.net/DigiTrax/KeyspanAdapters/KeyspanUSB.shtml</a>.
	  Note that we've had a report that certain models of the PDA
	  adapter don't work at 57,600 baud with the LocoBuffer,  so please
	  try 19,200 baud if you're having trouble. </p>
	    See our page on 
	    <A HREF="../hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB adapters</a>
	    for more information

	<P><b>Uhlenbrock Intellibox</B> - The Intellibox has two
	  LocoNet connections, called LocoNet-T and LocoNet-B.  
	  The LocoNet-T connection can drive more devices, but does
	  not provide the Rail-Synch signals that some LocoNet devices
	  (particularly the BDL-16, -162 and -168) require.  A
	  LocoBuffer II should be connected to the LocoNet-T connection
	  if it is configured to take power from the LocoNet.
