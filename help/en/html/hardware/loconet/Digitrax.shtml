      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <p>JMRI software, including DecoderPro and PanelPro, works
      with your Digitrax command station to program decoders. To do
      this, it communicates with the command station over the
      LocoNet&reg; using one of several types of <a href=
      "#adapters">adapter</a>.</p>

      <h3>Command Stations</h3>

      <p>JMRI software supports the following LocoNet-based command
      stations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Zephyr Starter Set</li>

        <li>Zephyr Xtra Starter Set</li>

        <li>Super Empire Builder Set</li>

        <li>Chief Starter Set</li>

        <li>Super Chief Set</li>

        <li>Super Chief Xtra Set</li>

        <li>DCS50 Command Station/Booster/Throttle</li>

        <li>DCS51 Command Station/Booster/Throttle</li>

        <li>DCS52 Command Station/Booster/Throttle</li>

        <li>DB150 Command Station/Booster</li>

        <li>DCS100 Command Station/Booster</li>

        <li>DCS200 Command Station/Booster</li>

        <li>DCS240 Advanced Command Station/Booster</li>

        <li><a href="Uhlenbrock.shtml">Intellibox: The Uhlenbrock
        Central Unit</a></li>

        <li><a href="Uhlenbrock.shtml">Intellibox II or
        IB-Com</a></li>

        <li>DCC-Mux: DCC data combiner with built-in LocoNet
        command station</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For systems which do not provide a real LocoNet Command
      Station, two additional options are supported. When a layout
      uses LocoNet peripheral devices but not a LocoNet-based
      command station, a "<a href="StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">Standalone
      LocoNet</a>" is used.<br>
      In addition, JMRI software may be configured to use a simulated
      LocoNet connection instead of a real LocoNet connection. This
      is the "<a href="LocoNetSim.shtml">LocoNet&reg; Simulator</a>".</p>

      <a name="adapters" id="adapters"></a>
      <h3>Computer Interfaces</h3>

      <p>To connect your computer to the LocoNet, and hence to the
      command station, you need one of the following adapters:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a title="RR-CirKits USB interface" href=
        "LocoBufferUSB.shtml">LocoBuffer-USB</a></li>

        <li><a title="Digitrax PR3 and PR3 Xtra USB interface" href=
        "PR3.shtml">PR3, PR3 Xtra, and DCS240's "integrated" PR3 USB Interface</a></li>

        <li><a title="Digitrax PR4 USB interface" href=
        "PR4.shtml">PR4</a></li>

        <li><a title="RR-CirKits Serial interface" href=
        "LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer II</a></li>

        <li><a title="Original Kit Version" href=
        "LocoBuffer.shtml">LocoBuffer</a></li>

        <li><a title="Digitrax Serial interface" href=
        "MS100.shtml">MS-100</a></li>

        <li><a title="BT LocoBridge" href=
        "BTLocoBridge.shtml">Bluetooth LocoBridge</a></li>
      </ul>
      (Note: The Digitrax DSC240 has a built-in adapter that's
      similar to the Digitrax PR3; if you have a DCS240, configure
      JMRI for it by selecting a PR3 connection type and a DCS240
      command station type)

      <p>Generally, any of these can be used with any type of
      computer to communicate with any type of command station.
      Currently, the LocoBuffer-USB , PR3, and PR4 are the recommended
      computer interface solutions. The LocoBuffer II and original
      LocoBuffer are no longer commercially available; their
      primary advantage now is that they use a traditional serial
      port, which may be the only suitable connection type
      available on some older computers.</p>

      <p>The MS100 is <em>not</em> recommended; it sometimes fails to
      provide reliable communications, and it cannot be used with
      JMRI if you are using Mac OS X or on most Windows Vista
      machines. If you have problems with the MS100, you might not
      be able to fix them, and nobody may be able to help you.</p>

      <p>The Uhlenbrock Intellibox command stations can also be
      controlled directly through it's serial port or USB
      connection; there's a <a href="Uhlenbrock.shtml">separate
      page</a> on how to do this.</p>

      <h4><a name="Programmer" id="Programmer">PR2, PR3, and PR4 acting as Decoder
      Programmers</a></h4>JMRI can also use a <a title=
      "Digitrax programmer" href="PR2.shtml">Digitrax PR2</a>, the
      <a title="Digitrax Programmer/USB interface" href=
         "PR3.shtml">Digitrax PR3</a>, or the <a title="PR4.shtml">Digitrax PR4</a>
         to program and test decoders. The PR2 is
      a stand-alone decoder programming unit which does not connect
      to the rest of the layout, the command station, nor to a
      LocoNet. For more information on using a PR2 with DecoderPro,
      please see the <a href="PR2.shtml">PR2 setup page</a>. The
      PR3 and PR4 devices can be configured in JMRI to operate as either a stand-
      alone programmer, or as an interface to to a LocoNet. There
      is more information on the <a href="PR3.shtml">PR3 setup
          page</a> and the <a href="PR4.shtml">PR4 setup page</a>.

      <h2><a name="Limitation" id="Limitation">Hardware Interface and Command Station Limitations</a></h2>

      <p><strong>Uhlenbrock Intellibox</strong> - The Intellibox has two
      LocoNet connections, called LocoNet-T and LocoNet-B. The
      LocoNet-T connection can drive more devices, but does not
      provide the Rail-Synch signals that some LocoNet devices
      (particularly boosters and the BDL16, BDL162 and BDL168)
      require. A LocoBuffer should be connected to the LocoNet-T
      connection.</p>

      <p><strong>Uhlenbrock Intellibox II and IB-Com</strong> - The
      Intellibox II and IB-Com have two LocoNet connections, called
      LocoNet-T and LocoNet-B. The LocoNet-T connection can drive
      more devices, but does not provide the Rail-Synch signals
      that some LocoNet devices (particularly boosters and the
      BDL16, BDL162 and BDL168) require. A LocoBuffer should be
      connected to the LocoNet-T connection.</p>

      <p><strong>PR-1 not supported</strong> - Note that DecoderPro
      cannot directly program decoders via a PR1 programmer. JMRI
      supports decoder programming either via the PR3 as a
      stand-alone programmer or via a command station.</p>

      <p><strong>Mac OS X and the MS100</strong> - Because Mac OS X can't
      communicate at the special baud rate used by the MS100, the
      MS100 won't work with Mac OS X. You should get a
      LocoBuffer-USB instead.</p>

      <p><strong>Microsoft Vista and the MS100</strong> - It has been
      reported that Vista does not support the special baud rate
      used by the MS100. If you find that your MS100 does not work
      on your Vista machine you should get a LocoBuffer-USB, PR3, or PR4
      instead.</p><a name="Setup" id="Setup"></a>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <p>To connect your computer to a Digitrax DCC system, you
      need a <a title="RR-CirKits USB interface" href=
      "LocoBufferUSB.shtml">LocoBuffer-USB</a>, <a title=
      "Digitrax PR3 USB interface" href="PR3.shtml">PR3</a>, <a title=
      "Digitrax PR4 USB interface" href="PR4.shtml">PR4</a>, <a title=
      "RR-CirKits Serial interface" href=
      "LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer-II</a>, <a title=
      "Original Kit Version" href="LocoBuffer.shtml">LocoBuffer</a>
      or <a title="Digitrax Serial interface" href=
      "MS100.shtml">MS100</a> to act as an adapter. The LocoBuffer-USB is highly
      recommended. See <a href="#adapters">below</a> for more on
      adapters.</p>

      <p>Note that except for the PR3 and PR4, these are only LocoNet
      interfaces, not stand alone programmers like the Digitrax PR2.
      The Digitrax PR3 and PR4 devices may act either as a standalone
      programmer or as a LocoNet interface.  Readback of decoder CVs
      is possible when using a programming track controlled by a PR3 or PR4
      (in stand-alone programming mode) or when using a programming track
      controlled by a Chief, Zephyr, Advanced (DCS210) or Evolution (DCS240)
      command station. The Empire Builder (DB150) command station does not allow
      Readback of decoder CVs; users of the Empire Builder can add CV Readback
      capability by using a programming track connected to a PR3 or PR4 when
      operating in stand-alone programming mode.</p>

      <p>The steps below show how to add a connection to JMRI
      (DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc.) for a LocoNet-based system.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Connect your adapter to the LocoNet, and connect your
        computer to it with the appropriate serial or USB
        cable.</li>

        <li>Mac and Windows users should install the proper USB
        drivers if they are using USB devices.</li>

        <li>Linux and Mac users should be sure that the correct
        Java communications packages have been installed.</li>

        <li>Open a JMRI program and go to the "Preferences" panel.
        This normally opens automatically the first time each
        program is run, or you can select it from the "Edit"
        menu.</li>

        <li>Select the "Connections" item in the window at the
        left.</li>

        <li>Select "Digitrax" in the "System Manufacturer"
        box.</li>

        <li>Select the appropriate adapter type in the "System
        Connection" box.</li>

        <li>You can then configure the proper settings in the
        "Settings" box. The "Serial Port" must be properly selected
        and the connection settings properly configured in order
        for JMRI to talk to the adapter hardware. On some systems
        with some system connection adapter types, the "Serial
        Port" setting will be automatically selected. In other
        cases the first possible "Serial Port" connection will be
        selected by default. It may be necessary to use tools
        provided with the computer operating system to determine
        which "Serial Port" is appropriate for your particular
        situation.</li>

        <li>Select the appropriate "Command Station Type":

          <p>When the "Connection Type" is set for the PR3 or PR4, the
          "Command Station Type" can be set to "PRx in stand-alone
          programming mode" or set to one of the command station
          types. When set for stand-alone programming, the PR3/PR4 will
          not communicate with LocoNet. When set for a specific
          command station type, the PR3/PR4 programming track is not
          used; instead, decoder programming is done through the
          mechanisms provided by the selected command station.</p>

          <p>When "DB150 (Empire Builder)" is selected, JMRI
          decoder programming is done via the DB150 programming
          mechanisms. The DB150 is not capable of reading decoder
          CV values, so JMRI will not be able to read decoder CV
          values via the DB150 programming mechanisms. Empire
          Builder users can use a PR3/PR4 in stand-alone programmer
          mode, instead of the Empire Builder programming track, to
          allow decoder CV readback. Some users configure
          DecoderPro for programming decoders using the PR3/PR4 in
          stand-alone programming mode, and then configure PanelPro
          to use the PR3/PR4 in LocoNet interface mode (also called
          "MS100 mode") to allow PanelPro to communicate with the
          Empire Builder command station and LocoNet-connected
          peripherals. More PR3 setup information can be found on
          the <a href="PR3.shtml">PR3 setup page</a>.  More PR4 setup
          information can be found on the <a href="PR4.shtml">PR4
          setup page</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>The "Connection Prefix" is used to help JMRI
        communicate separately with multiple "connections" to
        layout hardware. Each "connection" must have a unique
        identifier, which is specified as the "Connection Prefix".
        By default, the first LocoNet connection is given a prefix
        of "L", and additional LocoNet are given prefixes like
        "L1", "L2", ... Most users should be able to use the
        default "Connection Prefix" value provided by the JMRI
        tools.

          <p>It is recommended that all connections for LocoNet
          hardware use a prefix that begins with "L", as other
          characters are normally associated with other hardware
          connection types.</p>
        </li>

        <li>When a JMRI tool is configured for more than one
        connection, each connection gets a menu item on the main
        JMRI tool window. To help users differentiate between their
        different connections, each connection has a "Connection
        Name", which is used as the name of the associated menu
        item on the main JMRI tool window. Users may change the
        "Connection Name" for any connection to suit their
        needs.</li>

        <li>Some adapters may have addition configuration options,
        which may be shown by checking the "Additional Connection
        Settings". This may show additional settings which may be
        made for some adapter types. These include, but are not
        limited to, the options listed here.

          <ul>
            <li>The "Baud Rate" setting. When multiple settings are
            available, this must be set to match the needs of the
            particular hardware adapter specified in the "System
            Connection" setting. This setting will be pre-set and
            unchangeable you have selected a LocoBuffer-USB, PR3, PR4,
            or MS100 "System Connection". There are two speed
            choices for the LocoBuffer and LocoBuffer-II; select
            the one that corresponds to the jumper settings on your
            LocoBuffer unit. We recommend that you start with the
            19,200 choice for the LocoBuffer or LocoBuffer-II; see
            the <a href="LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer-II</a> and
            <a href="LocoBuffer.shtml">LocoBuffer</a> pages for
            more information.</li>

            <li>The <a href="#TurnoutCmdHandling">"Command Station
            Turnout Command Rejection and JMRI Turnout Command
            Handling"</a> settings are described <a href=
            "#TurnoutCmdHandling">below</a>.</li>

            <li>The "Transponding Present" allows you indicate whether
                certain special hardware is present and configured.
                If you have LocoNet-attached boards that configure
                in "ops mode", or if you have Digitrax Transponding
                installed, set this to "Yes". Otherwise, set it to
                "No". </li>

            <li>The "Connection Uses" selection determines how
            "flow control" is implemented in software. This
            selection should be configured for "hardware flow
            control" unless you later consistently get a JMRI
            console message about the LocoBuffer control leads
            being improperly set up, in which case you might want
            to try to bypass that by selecting "no flow control".
            This box will be blank if you've selected
            LocoBuffer-USB, PR3, PR4 or MS100.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the
        program to quit, click "Yes".</li>

        <li style="text-align:left;">Restart JMRI. You should be up
        and running.<br></li>
      </ol>

      <p>If you are going to control Turnouts, Signals or other
      devices on your layout from JMRI or another program, we
      recommend that you disable, where available, the command
      station's "Meter route/switch output when not in trinary"
      feature.  When enabled, this option greatly reduces the number of
      commands the LocoNet can handle each second, which can cause
      significant delays when you're controlling signals, etc. To
      disable it, you can use the "Configure Command Station" tool
      in the <strong>LocoNet</strong> menu, or the Roster-based mechanism, or
      the throttle-based programming mechanisms as described in the
      manual for your command station.  The command station may not
      immediately accept OpSw setting changes, so it may be necessary
      to "power-cycle" the command station, or to "put the command
      station to sleep" via the command station front-panel switch.</p>

      <p>Note that some command stations disable metering (i.e.
      provide faster turnout command handling) when OpSw31="t" and
      others when OpSw31="c".  Here's a list of command stations
      and the OpSw31 setting which will speed-up command station
      turnout command handling:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DCS100/DCS200 - OpSw31="t" for faster turnout command handling
        (i.e. disables metering)</li>
        <li>DCS240 - OpSw31="c" for faster turnout command handling (i.e. disables metering)</li>

      <p>If you will have multiple connections, the "Defaults" tab
      in the "Preferences" panel may be used to direct certain
      types of operations to different connections. A good example
      of this is a system with two PR3 connections, one in
      stand-alone programmer mode for programming decoder CVs, and
      the other for communication with a layout LocoNet and command
      station. In this case, use the "Defaults" settings to select
      one LocoNet connection only for "Programmer" and the other
      LocoNet connection for "Throttles", "Power Control", and

      <h2><a name="Using" id="Using">Using JMRI with
      LocoNet&reg;</a></h2>JMRI provides a number of features which
      allow it to interact with LocoNet.  Some key things to know about
      are included here.

      <h3><a name="LocoNetAddressing" id="LocoNetAddressing">LocoNet Device Addressing</a></h3>
      <p>Many LocoNet devices can be directly addressed by JMRI,
        such as the individual turnout outputs on a DS54, or the
        individual block detection inputs on a BDL16x. For more
        information on how to find those addresses, see <a href=
        "Addressing.shtml">this page</a>.</p>

      <h3><a name="LocoNetTools" id="LocoNetTools">LocoNet Tools</a></h3>
        <p>JMRI provides a variety of LocoNet-related tools. These
        primarily allow configuration of LocoNet device
        functionality, but also include some tools for status
        monitoring. Information on these tools can be found at the
        <a href="LocoNetTools.shtml">LocoNet&reg; tools
        page</a>.</p>

      <h2><a name="Network" id="Network">Networked Computers and
      LocoNet&reg;</a></h2>There are several mechanisms available
      to allow multiple computers to communicate with LocoNet.
      These communicate via standard TCP/IP protocols, and can even
      work remotely. At least one of the networked computers must
      have a functioning LocoNet interface. See <a href=
      "LocoNetworking.shtml">this page</a> for more information.

      <h2><a name="Debugging" id="Debugging">Debugging</a></h2>

      <ul>
        <li>When using the LocoBuffer or LocoBuffer-II, be sure
        that the JMRI preferences for the connection are set to use
        the same Baud rate as the LocoBuffer or LocoBuffer-II.</li>

        <li>On Windows O/S machines, be sure that the JMRI
        connection is set to use the correct COM port. Use Windows
        "Device Manager" to help determine which COM port your
        interface hardware is using, then verify that JMRI is
        configured to use that COM port.</li>

        <li>On Windows platforms, the COM port assignment can
        change if the interface hardware is moved from one USB port
        on the computer to another USB port. Avoid changing how
        your LocoNet-to-computer interface is connected to the
        computer.</li>

        <li>On Windows platforms, the COM port assignment can
        change if the interface hardware is connected via a USB
        hub. At Windows start-up, the computer can assign different
        COM port numbers to devices downstream of USB hubs, even if
        all of the USB hardware connected in the system has not
        been changed. Avoid connecting your LocoNet-to-computer
        hardware downstream of a hub. Note that a computer monitor
        which has USB connectors, and which is connected to a PC
        using a USB cable is considered to have a built-in USB
        hub.</li>

        <li>Some PR3 devices were shipped with poor quality USB
        cables. These cables have been known to cause a computer to
        fail to communicate with the PR3 or to have intermittent
        communication. Users should consider replacing the original
        USB cable from the PR3 with a known-good USB cable.</li>

      <h4><a name="ErraticReadback" id="ErraticReadback">Erratic or
      Non-Functioning CV Readback</a></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Some mobile decoders will only allow proper Readback of
        CV values when there is a sufficient electrical load
        connected to the F0F (front headlamp) output connections or
        the motor connections. This means that an incandescent lamp
        or LED is properly connected to the front headlamp
        connection and functional. Other mobile decoders will only
        provide proper CV Readback when a motor is connected to the
        mobile decoder motor connections. Consult the documentation
        for your mobile decoder to determine what connections are
        required to allow proper CV readback.</li>

        <li>Some Digitrax hardware is capable of successful CV read
        and write operations on some mobile decoders but is unable
        to reliably read and/or write CVs for other mobile
        decoders. This problem is most obvious with sound decoders
        from some manufacturers. Some suggestions are listed here.

          <ul>
            <li>When using a Zephyr (DCS50) or Zephyr Xtra (DCS51),
            enable its "Blast Mode" programming feature. This will
            often allow correct writing of mobile decoder CV
            values.</li>

            <li>"Programming on the main" can allow a Chief (DCS100
            or DCS200) to properly write to difficult mobile
            decoder's CV values.</li>

            <li>A programming booster, such as the
            <i>SoundTraxx</i> <strong>PTB-100</strong> or the <i>DCC
            Specialties</i> <strong>Power Pax</strong> can often be used
            between the command station programming track
            connections and the programming track to allow
            successful read and write access of CVs on mobile
            decoders which do not allow Readback on a programming
            track connected directly to the programming
            hardware.</li>

            <li>Some PR3 users report that the PR3 programming
            track can successfully read and program sound decoders
            when the PR3 is powered using an 18 Volts DC power
            supply instead of a lower-voltage power supply such as
            the PS12 or PS14. <strong>Do this at your own
            risk!</strong> <em>Current Digitrax documentation for
            the PR3 defines a maximum input voltage of 15 Volts DC,
            where previously the maximum voltage was listed as 20
            Volts DC. Use of input voltages higher than 15 Volts DC
            could damage the PR3 hardware.</em></li>

      <h4><a name="TurnoutCmdHandling" id=
      "TurnoutCmdHandling">Command Station Turnout Command
      Rejection and JMRI Turnout Command Handling</a></h4>

      <p>Digitrax command stations pass LocoNet switch command
      messages to the DCC track signal so that track-connected
      accessory decoders can receive the switch commands. Digitrax
      command stations seem to buffer the switch requests and
      forward them to the DCC track signal in a way that does not
      have a noticeable impact on mobile decoder response to
      throttle control operations. This buffer is limited, and
      under conditions of heavy LocoNet switch command traffic, can
      overflow. When this happens, the command station will respond
      with a message (a <code>\&lt;LONG_ACK\&gt;</code> opcode)
      saying that it rejected (did not accept) the switch command.
      When the command station gives this response, the switch
      command is not placed into the buffer and is forgotten.<br>
      This can be problematic, depending on how the device which
      sent the switch command responds to the rejection message on
      LocoNet. Many LocoNet devices do not notice the rejection
      message, so do not attempt to re-send the switch command.
      Other LocoNet devices can pay attention to the rejection
      message and can wait a while before re-sending the message.
      Some LocoNet devices can be programmed either to resend the
      switch command if the rejection message is seen, or to not
      resend if the rejection message is seen.<br>
      This wide variety of behaviors can cause inconsistent or
      unreliable behavior of any device which relies on stationary
      decoder messages on the DCC track signal. Note that this can
      include devices which connect to LocoNet and which monitor
      the DCC track signal which is available on the LocoNet cable
      "RailSync" wires.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a name="turncmdhandsettings" id=
          "turncmdhandsettings">Turnout Command Handling
          Settings</a>

          <p>JMRI has various mechanisms to help handle these
          temporary LocoNet switch command buffer overloads. These
          mechanisms are controlled by the "Turnout Command
          Handling" option for each LocoNet-based connection. The
          four JMRI Turnout Command Handling options are described
          below.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Normal - the default setting, is recommended for
            the vast majority of layouts. In this mode of
            operation, JMRI will quickly retry the last LocoNet
            switch command seen before the command station's switch
            command rejection message, and will continue to repeat
            the switch command until a switch command is accepted
            by the command station. This quick retry can cause
            extremely high levels of activity on LocoNet.</li>

            <li>Spread - This mode is the same as "Normal",
            described above, except that JMRI implements additional
            delay between any switch commands which it sends to
            LocoNet. This should reduce the likelihood that JMRI
            commands would cause an overflow of the Digitrax
            command station switch command buffer, but does not
            have any effect on other LocoNet devices which generate
            LocoNet switch commands. The retry mechanism described
            above for the "Normal" mode is enabled.</li>

            <li>Once Only - This disables the JMRI retry mechanism
            for rejected switch commands. JMRI will not retry any
            LocoNet switch command messages. The amount of delay
            between any two JMRI-generated switch commands sent to
            LocoNet is the same as "Normal" mode.</li>

            <li>Both - This option both disables the JMRI rejected
            switch command retry mechanism and increases the delay
            between any two switch commands sent by JMRI to
            LocoNet.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These options do not take effect until the preferences
          are saved and JMRI is restarted.<br>
          None of these options can <i>guarantee</i> that
          <i>all</i> LocoNet switch messages <i>will</i> be passed
          to the DCC track signal.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a name="alternatives" id="alternatives">Command Station Turnout Command
          Rejection Avoidance Strategies</a>
          <p>There are a number of strategies which can be used to avoid the
          "turnout command retry storms" which can occur with JMRI.

          <ul>
              <li>Do not use "flashing" signal aspects when signal hardware does
              not provide the flashing mechanism.  When the hardware does not
              provide an appropriate flashing mechanism, JMRI must manually
              change the signal head aspect from "a lit color" to "dark" and
              repeat for the duration that the signal head displays a flashing
              aspect.  This is a problem that occurs with JMRI when using SE8C
              signal heads, and can occur with other signal head types.
              <p>Alternatively, in some cases it may be possible to configure the
              signaling hardware so that JMRI need not send frequent individual
              turnout commands to implement flashing aspects.  While this option
              may be useful with some signaling hardware, this option does
              not apply to JMRI when using SE8C signal heads.</li>

              <li>Some users find it possible to take advantage of the JMRI
              "automation" feature which uses a different mechanism to control
              switches.  With a LocoNet connection, this mechanism uses LocoNet
              messages which are specifically sent to the DCC track signal.  These
              messages are neither the "normal" LocoNet turnout control messages
              nor the "alternate" LocoNet turnout control messages used with the
              command station "Bushby" feature, described below.
              <p>See <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml#automation">
              Turnout Table "automation"</a>help for more information on this
              mechanism.
              <p>When using this mechanism with LocoNet connections, the turnout
              must not be configured for "MONITORING" feedback mode, as the
              messaging used with this mechanism does not use the messages required
              by "MONITORING" feedback mode.
              This may be done in the JMRI <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">
              "Turnout Table"</a> by setting a turnout's  "Feedback" mode to one
              of "Direct", "OneSensor", "TwoSensor", "Indirect" or "Exact" (choose
              one depending on the usable mode), and then configure the "Turnout
              Automation" mode to "RAW".
              <p>The image below shows one possible configuration which takes
              advantage of this JMRI feature for a LocoNet turnout.
              <p><a href="images/LnTurnoutFeedbackAutomationSettings.png">
              <img width="50%" src="images/LnTurnoutFeedbackAutomationSettings.png"
              alt="Image showing JMRI turnout entry with feecback and
              automation settings visible"></a>
              <p>(Click the image for a larger version of the image.)
              <p>The effect of this setting is to (potentially) reduce the maximum
              rate at which the command station must forward LocoNet turnout
              control messages to the DCC track signal.  This (potentially) reduces
              the demands on the command station's buffering, thus potentially
              reducing the likelihood of the command station's buffer filling.
              <p>When this mode is used for a given turnout, JMRI does not make
              any use of the "Bypass Bushby Bit" or the "Send ON and OFF"
              configuration information.
              <p>This type of JMRI configuration does not affect those LocoNet
              turnout control messages generated by other LocoNet devices.
              <p>There is some
              question about how Digitrax command stations handle the messages
              associated with this mechanism, which must be buffered by the
              command station, and whether that command station buffering is any
              different than the buffering used with "normal" and "alternate"
              LocoNet turnout messages.
              </li>
              <li>JMRI normally sends an "ON" LocoNet message followed by an
              "OFF" LocoNet message when controlling switches, just like Digitrax
              throttles do.  <span class="since">Since
              <a href="http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri4.15.7.shtml" target="_blank">
              JMRI 4.15.7</a></span>, it is possible to configure JMRI to send
              only "ON" messages to turnouts, without sending "OFF" messages.  Many
              accessory decoders work well when only receiving "ON" messages.
              <p>Using this JMRI feature reduces the number of LocoNet switch
              control messages which need to be forwarded to the DCC track signal,
              which reduces the probability that any given LocoNet switch command
              will arrive at the command station when its buffer is already full.
              <p>To configure this JMRI operating mode, it is necessary to
              configure each individual JMRI turnout, via the JMRI
              <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">
              "Turnout Table"</a>.  The image below shows that turnouts
              LT10 and LT12 are configured to send both "ON" and "OFF" messages -
              each of these turnouts have the "Send ON and OFF" checkbox checked.
              In the image, turnouts LT11 and LT13 have the checkbox unchecked, so
              JMRI will only send "ON" messages when JMRI controls these turnouts.

              <p>(Click the image for a larger version of the image.)
              <p>If the "Send ON and OFF" column is not visible, you may check the
              "Show System-specific columns" checkbox at the bottom of the window, or
              you may "right-click" while pointing to any visible header and then
              check the "Send ON and OFF" checkbox.
              <p>When a new JMRI turnout is created, the "Send ON and OFF" checkbox
              is checked by default.
              <p>Note that the "Send ON and OFF" checkbox settings have no effect LocoNet
              switch control messages sent by other LocoNet agents.</li>

              <li>It is possible to configure Digitrax command stations so that they
              do not forward <i>"regular"</i> LocoNet turnout control messages to
              the DCC track signal (and RailSync wires on the LocoNet cable).  This
              may be done by enabling the command station's "Bushby" feature, typically
              done by configuring the command station's OpSw27 to "c"losed.  JMRI
              provides two methods for modifying Digitrax command station OpSw
              settings.  Both are described in this <a href="CommandStationConfig.shtml">
              Command Station Configuration</a> help page.
              <p>When the command station "Bushby" feature is enabled, only turnout
              commands using a special LocoNet message type will be forwarded to
              the DCC track signal.  This can be used in a few different ways.
              <ul>
                  <li>Some users simply enable the command station "Bushby" feature,
                  without re-configuring any LocoNet device or JMRI features.  In
                  this case, no turnout control messages are forwarded to the DCC
                  track signal by the command station, and those devices which get
                  their control information from turnout commands on the DCC track
                  signal (or the low-power version on the RailSync wires on the
                  LocoNet cable) will not be controllable.
                  <p>This option is only suitable for layouts where there are no
                  devices which are controlled solely by the DCC track signal (or
                  its low-power equivalent on the LocoNet cable.
                  <p>Note that some devices get their control messages from the
                  low-power DCC track signal on the LocoNet RailSync wires <i>or</i>
                  from the LocoNet Data wires.  If this type of device must be
                  controllable when the command station's Bushby feature is enabled,
                  the device must be configured to get control messages from the
                  LocoNet Data wires.  An example is the SE8C, which defaults to
                  receive control messages from the low-power DCC track signal on
                  the LocoNet cable.  To configure the SE8C to be controlled by
                  LocoNet messages, set the SE8C OpSw14 to "C"losed.  Other device
                  types may require similar re-configuration to be controllable.
                  </li>

                  JMRI 4.15.7</a></span>, JMRI provides a feature which "bypasses"
                  the command station's "Bushby" feature and therefore allows JMRI
                  to control those devices which are controlled by turnout control
                  information on the DCC track signal.  This requires configuration
                  of individual JMRI Turnouts (via the
                  <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">
                  "Turnout Table"</a>) to have their "Bypass Bushby Bit" checkbox
                  checked.  This enables JMRI to send "alternate" LocoNet Turnout
                  control messages to the command station, and these "alternate"
                  messages will be buffered so that they may be passed to the DCC
                  track signal, regardless of the state of the command station's
                  "Bushby" feature.
                  <p>To configure this JMRI feature for a turnout, define the
                  turnout (if necessary) in the JMRI <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">
                  "Turnout Table"</a>, and place a check in the turnout's "Bypass
                  Bushby Bit" checkbox.  If the "Bypass Bushby Bit" column is not
                  visible in the table, you may right-click on the table column header
                  row and check "Bypass Bushby Bit", or check the "Show system-specific
                  settings" checkbox at the bottom of the window.
                  <p>In the image above, turnouts LT12 and LT13 show the "Bypass Bushby
                  Bit" checked.  When JMRI attempts to control either of these two
                  turnouts, JMRI will send an alternate LocoNet turnout control message
                  ("OPC_SW_ACK"), which will bypass the command station's "Bushby"
                  blocking of "regular" LocoNet turnout control messages ("OPC_SW_REQ").
                  <p>Note that the command station still buffers the "alternate"
                  LocoNet turnout control messages, and turnout message rejection
                  can occur.  As such, it is important to configure the "Bypass Bushby
                  Bit" option only on those turnouts which require conrol via the
                  DCC track signal or the low-power version that is available on
                  the LocoNet cable's RailSync wires.
                  <p>Also note that setting the JMRI "Bushby Bit Bypass" feature
                  a given turnout does <em>not</em> affect how turnout control
                  messages from other LocoNet are encoded.  Unless another LocoNet
                  device uses the "alternate" LocoNet turnout control message, that
                  LocoNet device will not be able to pass turnout control messages
                  to the DCC track signal when the command station "Bushby" feature
                  is enabled.
                  </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
          <li>The best turnout command rejection avoidance strategy is one in
          which the command station never even sees the LocoNet turnout control
          messages. This can be done by using only devices which send and/or
          receive switch control messages via the LocoNet data bus, and placing
          all of those devices on a  <i>"Standalone"</i> LocoNet for use by those
          devices. This standalone LocoNet can be separately connected to JMRI
          (on a second connection) so that JMRI can access the command station,
          throttles, fast clock, and other resources via one LocoNet connection,
          and access signals and turnouts via another LocoNet connection. This
          requires a separate LocoNet interface device for each connection.
          <p>See the JMRI <a href="StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">Standalone LocoNet&reg;</a>
          page for background, ideas, and suggestions for implementing a
          Standalone LocoNet.</li>

          "cmdStationTrkPwrOff">Turnout command rejection when
          track power is off</a>

          <p>Some more recent Digitrax command stations will refuse
          to accept switch commands when track power is turned off.
          This can result in a "storm" of repeated switch messages
          on LocoNet if track power is off when switch messages are
          sent. This problem can be avoided by ensuring that track
          power is on when switch messages are to be sent.</p>

          <a name="multConnTurnoutReject" id=
          "multConnTurnoutReject">Turnout command rejection and
          multiple active LocoNet connections</a>

          <p>When JMRI has multiple active connections to a single
          LocoNet, it may be necessary to configure all but one of
          the active LocoNet connections for "Turnout Command
          Handling" type of "Only One", with one active LocoNet
          connection configured for one of the other "Turnout
          Command Handling" types. Failure to do this could cause
          the various JMRI LocoNet connection instances to
          independently attempt to resolve any turnout messages
          which have been rejected by the command station. This
          could result in a storm of turnout command retries on
          LocoNet.<br>
          Similarly, when multiple JMRI instances are working with
          the same LocoNet, only one JMRI connection to the LocoNet
          should be configured for a "Turnout Command Handling"
          type other than "Only One". Failure to do this could
          cause the various JMRI LocoNet connection instances to
          independently attempt to resolve any turnout messages
          which have been rejected by the command station. This
          could result in a storm of turnout command retries on
          LocoNet.</p>

      <a name="loconetRoster" id="loconetRoster"></a><h3>Configuring some LocoNet
          devices via "Roster" entries</h3>
      <p>Some LocoNet devices can be configured via JMRI a "roster" entry.  Simply
          select the appropriate "decoder" name when creating a new roster entry.
          These include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>DCS100/DCS200/DCS50/DCS51/DCS52/DB150/DCS210/DCS240 (only when acting as
              a command station)</li>
          <li>BDL16/BDL162/BDL168</li>
          <li>DS64</li>
          <li>PM4/PM42</li>
          <li>SE8C</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Often, these "decoder" definitions have some limitations on which features
          can be configured, and, where appropriate, limitations on the supported
          range of "board id" values.  These limitations are documented on a "Notes"
          tab within the "comprehensive" programmer window.

      <p>Note that JMRI generally provides other (historical) tools which are able to
        configure the same set of features via tools in the "LocoNet" menu.  Any
        changes made to device configuration using the historical tools will
        <strong>not</strong> be reflected in a roster entry for the device.  If you wish to
        keep the roster updated with any changes made via historical tools or using
        other tools or processes, it will be necessary to manually update the
        roster entry.</p>

      <a name="devicetoollimits" id="devicetoollimits"></a><h3>Some JMRI LocoNet-specific device and feature limitations</h3>

      <ul>

          <li><p>At this time, Digitrax "expanded" slots are not directly supported.
                  This has several implicaitons:
              <ul>
                  <li>The
           <a href=
            "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/loconet/slotmon/SlotMonFrame.shtml">
            Monitor Slots</a> tool is only able to display information for "standard"
      slots.  It is possible when using a DCS240 that a loco can be shown as
      occupying a "standard" slot when it actually is being controlled by an
      "extended" slot.  When this occurs, the display will generallly be "corrected" within a few minutes.</li>
                  <li>JMRI can have difficulty acquiring and/or dispatching a loco
                      when the loco has been acquired into an "expanded" slot by
                      a throttle with enabled "expanded" slot capability.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>As such, many users find that disabling DCS240 "expanded" slot
              capability can improve some aspects of JMRI "throttle" functionality,
              including WiThrottle Server funcitonality.</p></li>


          <li><p>At this time, the Digitrax BXP88 and BXPA1 devices do not support a
      mechanism to allow JMRI to program individual device OpSw settings via
      LocoNet messaging.</p>
              <p>While JMRI cannot provide mechanisms to configure these
      devices, for their block detection and transponding features, their
      behavior is similar to the BDL16x device.  JMRI's existing support for
      BDL16x block detection and transponding features provides appropriate
      support for the BXP88/BXPA1 detection and transponding operational
      features.  JMRI's existing support for PM4x power management features
      provides appropriate support for the BXP88/BXPA1 power management
      operational features.</p></li>

          <li><p> The LNWI similarly does not provide mechanisms to allow JMRI configuration
            of individual LNWI OpSw settings.  However, some LNWI "SSID" information
            may be influenced by the operations performed by the <a href=
            "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/loconet/duplexgroup/DuplexGroupTabbedPanel.shtml">
            Configure Duplex Group</a>
            tool.  Note that some specific LNWI OpSw settings are able to block the effect
            of that tool upon the LNWI's SSID configuration.</p></li>
          <li>LocoNet does not provide any good way to allow JMRI to configure the
            settings of any "booster".  Configure boosters using the mechanisms
            documented by the booster manufacturer.</li>
          <li>The LocoNet "Command Station Configure" tool does not give access to OpSw
            settings for OpSw 49 and above.  This prevents the tool from accessing
            some OpSw settings on DCS240, DCS210, and DCS52 command stations.
            JMRI's "<a href="../../apps/DecoderPro/Roster.shtml">Roster</a>"-based
            command station configuration does not have this limitation.  Both
            mechanisms are described in <a href="CommandStationConfig.shtml">this page</a>.</li>
