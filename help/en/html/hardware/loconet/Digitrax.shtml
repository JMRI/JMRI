      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <p>JMRI software, including DecoderPro and PanelPro, works
      with your Digitrax command station to program decoders. To do
      this, it communicates with the command station over the
      LocoNet&reg; using one of several types of <a href=
      "#adapters">adapter</a>.</p>

      <h3>Command Stations</h3>

      <p>JMRI software supports the following LocoNet-based command
      stations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Zephyr Starter Set</li>

        <li>Zephyr Xtra Starter Set</li>

        <li>Super Empire Builder Set</li>

        <li>Chief Starter Set</li>

        <li>Super Chief Set</li>

        <li>Super Chief Xtra Set</li>

        <li>DCS50 Command Station/Booster/Throttle</li>

        <li>DCS51 Command Station/Booster/Throttle</li>

        <li>DB150 Command Station/Booster</li>

        <li>DCS100 Command Station/Booster</li>

        <li>DCS200 Command Station/Booster</li>

        <li>DCS240 Advanced Command Station/Booster</li>

        <li><a href="Uhlenbrock.shtml">Intellibox: The Uhlenbrock
        Central Unit</a></li>

        <li><a href="Uhlenbrock.shtml">Intellibox II or
        IB-Com</a></li>

        <li>DCC-Mux: DCC data combiner with built-in LocoNet
        command station</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For systems which do not provide a LocoNet command
      station, two additional options are supported. When a layout
      uses LocoNet peripheral devices but not a LocoNet-based
      command station, a "Standalone" LocoNet is used. See <a href=
      "StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">Standalone LocoNet</a>. In
      addition, JMRI software may be configured to use a simulated
      LocoNet connection instead of a real LocoNet connection. This
      is the "LocoNet Simulator".</p><a name="adapters" id=
      "adapters"></a>

      <h3>Computer Interfaces</h3>

      <p>To connect your computer to the LocoNet, and hence to the
      command station, you need one of the following adapters:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a title="RR-CirKits USB interface" href=
        "LocoBufferUSB.shtml">LocoBuffer-USB</a></li>

        <li><a title="Digitrax PR3 and PR3 Xtra USB interface" href=
        "PR3.shtml">PR3, PR3 Xtra, and DCS240's "integrated" PR3 USB Interface</a></li>

        <li><a title="Digitrax PR4 USB interface" href=
        "PR4.shtml">PR4</a></li>

        <li><a title="RR-CirKits Serial interface" href=
        "LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer II</a></li>

        <li><a title="Original Kit Version" href=
        "LocoBuffer.shtml">LocoBuffer</a></li>

        <li><a title="Digitrax Serial interface" href=
        "MS100.shtml">MS-100</a></li>

        <li><a title="BT LocoBridge" href=
        "BTLocoBridge.shtml">Bluetooth LocoBridge</a></li>
      </ul>(Note: The Digitrax DSC240 has a built-in adapter that's
      similar to the Digitrax PR3; if you have a DCS240, configure
      JMRI for it by selecting a PR3 connection type and a DCS240
      command station type)

      <p>Generally, any of these can be used with any type of
      computer to communicate with any type of command station.
      Currently, the LocoBuffer-USB and PR3 are the recommended
      computer interface solutions. The LocoBuffer II and original
      LocoBuffer are no longer commercially available; their
      primary advantage now is that they use a traditional serial
      port, which may be the only suitable connection type
      available on some older computers.</p>

      <p>The MS100 is not recommended; it sometimes fails to
      provide reliable communications, and it cannot be used with
      JMRI if you are using Mac OS X or on most Windows Vista
      machines. If you have problems with the MS100, you might not
      be able to fix them, and nobody may be able to help you.</p>

      <p>The Uhlenbrock Intellibox command stations can also be
      controlled directly through it's serial port or USB
      connection; there's a <a href="Uhlenbrock.shtml">separate
      page</a> on how to do this.</p>

      <h4><a name="Programmer" id="Programmer">PR2, PR3, and PR4
      Programmers</a></h4>JMRI can also use a <a title=
      "Digitrax programmer" href="PR2.shtml">Digitrax PR2</a>, the 
      <a title="Digitrax Programmer/USB interface" href=
         "PR3.shtml">Digitrax PR3</a>, or the <a title="PR4.shtml">Digitrax PR4</a>
         to program and test decoders. The PR2 is
      a stand-alone decoder programming unit which does not connect
      to the rest of the layout, the command station, nor to a
      LocoNet. For more information on using a PR2 with DecoderPro,
      please see the <a href="PR2.shtml">PR2 setup page</a>. The
      PR3 and PR4 devices can be configured in JMRI to operate as either a stand-
      alone programmer, or as an interface to to a LocoNet. There
      is more information on the <a href="PR3.shtml">PR3 setup
          page</a> and the <a href="PR4.shtml">PR4 setup page</a>.

      <h2><a name="Limitation" id="Limitation">Limitations</a></h2>

      <p><b>Uhlenbrock Intellibox</b> - The Intellibox has two
      LocoNet connections, called LocoNet-T and LocoNet-B. The
      LocoNet-T connection can drive more devices, but does not
      provide the Rail-Synch signals that some LocoNet devices
      (particularly boosters and the BDL16, BDL162 and BDL168)
      require. A LocoBuffer should be connected to the LocoNet-T
      connection.</p>

      <p><b>Uhlenbrock Intellibox II and IB-Com</b> - The
      Intellibox II and IB-Com have two LocoNet connections, called
      LocoNet-T and LocoNet-B. The LocoNet-T connection can drive
      more devices, but does not provide the Rail-Synch signals
      that some LocoNet devices (particularly boosters and the
      BDL16, BDL162 and BDL168) require. A LocoBuffer should be
      connected to the LocoNet-T connection.</p>

      <p><strong>PR-1 not supported</strong> - Note that DecoderPro
      cannot directly program decoders via a PR1 programmer. JMRI
      supports decoder programming either via the PR3 as a
      stand-alone programmer or via a command station.</p>

      <p><b>Mac OS X and the MS100</b> - Because Mac OS X can't
      communicate at the special baud rate used by the MS100, the
      MS100 won't work with Mac OS X. You should get a
      LocoBuffer-USB instead.</p>

      <p><b>Microsoft Vista and the MS100</b> - It has been
      reported that Vista does not support the special baud rate
      used by the MS100. If you find that your MS100 does not work
      on your Vista machine you should get a LocoBuffer-USB or PR3
      instead.</p><a name="Setup" id="Setup"></a>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <p>To connect your computer to a Digitrax DCC system, you
      need a <a title="RR-CirKits USB interface" href=
      "LocoBufferUSB.shtml">LocoBuffer-USB</a>, <a title=
      "Digitrax USB interface" href="PR3.shtml">PR3</a>, <a title=
      "RR-CirKits Serial interface" href=
      "LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer-II</a>, <a title=
      "Original Kit Version" href="LocoBuffer.shtml">LocoBuffer</a>
      or <a title="Digitrax Serial interface" href=
      "MS100.shtml">MS100</a> to act as an adapter. See below for
      more information on these. The LocoBuffer-USB is highly
      recommended.</p>

      <p>Note that except for the PR3, these are only LocoNet
      interfaces, not stand alone programmers like the Digitrax PR2
      and PR3. Readback of decoder CVs is possible when using a
      programming track controlled by a PR3 (in stand-alone
      programming mode) or a programming track controlled by a
      Chief or Zephyr command station. The Empire Builder command
      station does not allow Readback of decoder CVs; users of the
      Empire Builder can add CV Readback capability by using a
      programming track connected to a PR3 operating in stand-alone
      programming mode.</p>

      <p>The steps below show how to add a connection to JMRI
      (DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc.) for a LocoNet-based system.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Connect your adapter to the LocoNet, and connect your
        computer to it with the appropriate serial or USB
        cable.</li>

        <li>Mac and Windows users should install the proper USB
        drivers if they are using USB devices.</li>

        <li>Linux and Mac users should be sure that the correct
        Java communications packages have been installed.</li>

        <li>Open a JMRI program and go to the "Preferences" panel.
        This normally opens automatically the first time each
        program is run, or you can select it from the "Edit"
        menu.</li>

        <li>Select the "Connections" item in the window at the
        left.</li>

        <li>Select "Digitrax" in the "System Manufacturer"
        box.</li>

        <li>Select the appropriate adapter type in the "System
        Connection" box.</li>

        <li>You can then configure the proper settings in the
        "Settings" box. The "Serial Port" must be properly selected
        and the connection settings properly configured in order
        for JMRI to talk to the adapter hardware. On some systems
        with some system connection adapter types, the "Serial
        Port" setting will be automatically selected. In other
        cases the first possible "Serial Port" connection will be
        selected by default. It may be necessary to use tools
        provided with the computer operating system to determine
        which "Serial Port" is appropriate for your particular
        situation.</li>

        <li>Select the appropriate "Command Station Type":

          <p>When the "Connection Type" is set for the PR3, the
          "Command Station Type" can be set to "PR3 in stand-alone
          programming mode" or set to one of the command station
          types. When set for stand-alone programming, the PR3 will
          not communicate with LocoNet. When set for a specific
          command station type, the PR3 programming track is not
          used; instead, decoder programming is done through the
          mechanisms provided by the selected command station.</p>

          <p>When "DB150 (Empire Builder)" is selected, JMRI
          decoder programming is done via the DB150 programming
          mechanisms. The DB150 is not capable of reading decoder
          CV values, so JMRI will not be able to read decoder CV
          values via the DB150 programming mechanisms. Empire
          Builder users can use a PR3 in stand-alone programmer
          mode, instead of the Empire Builder programming track, to
          allow decoder CV readback. Some users configure
          DecoderPro for programming decoders using the PR3 in
          stand-alone programming mode, and then configure PanelPro
          to use the PR3 in LocoNet interface mode (also called
          "MS100 mode") to allow PanelPro to communicate with the
          Empire Builder command station and LocoNet-connected
          peripherals. More PR3 setup information can be found on
          the <a href="PR3.shtml">PR3 setup page</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>The "Connection Prefix" is used to help JMRI
        communicate separately with multiple "connections" to
        layout hardware. Each "connection" must have a unique
        identifier, which is specified as the "Connection Prefix".
        By default, the first LocoNet connection is given a prefix
        of "L", and additional LocoNet are given prefixes like
        "L1", "L2", ... Most users should be able to use the
        default "Connection Prefix" value provided by the JMRI
        tools.

          <p>It is recommended that all connections for LocoNet
          hardware use a prefix that begins with "L", as other
          characters are normally associated with other hardware
          connection types.</p>
        </li>

        <li>When a JMRI tool is configured for more than one
        connection, each connection gets a menu item on the main
        JMRI tool window. To help users differentiate between their
        different connections, each connection has a "Connection
        Name", which is used as the name of the associated menu
        item on the main JMRI tool window. Users may change the
        "Connection Name" for any connection to suit their
        needs.</li>

        <li>Some adapters may have addition configuration options,
        which may be shown by checking the "Additional Connection
        Settings". This may show additional settings which may be
        made for some adapter types. These include, but are not
        limited to, the options listed here.

          <ul>
            <li>The "Baud Rate" setting. When multiple settings are
            available, this must be set to match the needs of the
            particular hardware adapter specified in the "System
            Connection" setting. This setting will be pre-set and
            unchangeable you have selected a LocoBuffer-USB, PR3,
            or MS100 "System Connection". There are two speed
            choices for the LocoBuffer and LocoBuffer-II; select
            the one that corresponds to the jumper settings on your
            LocoBuffer unit. We recommend that you start with the
            19,200 choice for the LocoBuffer or LocoBuffer-II; see
            the <a href="LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer-II</a> and
            <a href="LocoBuffer.shtml">LocoBuffer</a> pages for
            more information.</li>

            <li>The <a href="#TurnoutCmdHandling">"Command Station
            Turnout Command Rejection and JMRI Turnout Command
            Handling"</a> setting is described <a href=
            "#TurnoutCmdHandling">below</a>.</li>

            <li>The "Connection Uses" selection determines how
            "flow control" is implemented in software. This
            selection should be configured for "hardware flow
            control" unless you later consistently get a JMRI
            console message about the LocoBuffer control leads
            being improperly set up, in which case you might want
            to try to bypass that by selecting "no flow control".
            This box will be blank if you've selected
            LocoBuffer-USB, PR3 or MS100.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the
        program to quit, click "Yes".</li>

        <li style="text-align:left;">Restart JMRI. You should be up
        and running.<br></li>
      </ol>

      <p>If you are going to control Turnouts, Signals or other
      devices on your layout from JMRI or another program, we
      recommend that you set the command station's "Meter
      route/switch output when not in trinary" option "Off"
      (Thrown). When On, this option greatly reduces the number of
      commands the LocoNet can handle each second, which can cause
      significant delays when you're controlling signals, etc. To
      turn it off, you can use the "Configure Command Station" tool
      in the <b>LocoNet</b> menu to set Option Switch 31 to "T"
      (Thrown), or set it via the Roster-based mechanism, or set 
      it directly in the command station using a Digitrax 
      Throttle.</p>

      <p>If you will have multiple connections, the "Defaults" tab
      in the "Preferences" panel may be used to direct certain
      types of operations to different connections. A good example
      of this is a system with two PR3 connections, one in
      stand-alone programmer mode for programming decoder CVs, and
      the other for communication with a layout LocoNet and command
      station. In this case, use the "Defaults" settings to select
      one LocoNet connection only for "Programmer" and the other
      LocoNet connection for "Throttles", "Power Control", and
      "Command Station".</p>

      <h2><a name="Using" id="Using">Using JMRI with
      LocoNet&reg;</a></h2>JMRI provides a number of features which
      allow it to interact with LocoNet.

      <ul>
        <li>Many LocoNet devices can be directly addressed by JMRI,
        such as the individual turnout outputs on a DS54, or the
        individual block detection inputs on a BDL16x. For more
        information on how to find those addresses, see <a href=
        "Addressing.shtml">this page</a>.</li>

        <li>JMRI provides a variety of LocoNet-related tools. These
        primarily allow configuration of LocoNet device
        functionality, but also include some tools for status
        monitoring. Information on these tools can be found at the
        <a href="LocoNetTools.shtml">LocoNet&reg; tools
        page</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="Network" id="Network">Networked Computers and
      LocoNet&reg;</a></h2>There are several mechanisms available
      to allow multiple computers to communicate with LocoNet.
      These communicate via standard TCP/IP protocols, and can even
      work remotely. At least one of the networked computers must
      have a functioning LocoNet interface. See <a href=
      "LocoNetworking.shtml">this page</a> for more information.

      <h2><a name="Debugging" id="Debugging">Debugging</a></h2>

      <ul>
        <li>When using the LocoBuffer or LocoBuffer-II, be sure
        that the JMRI preferences for the connection are set to use
        the same Baud rate as the LocoBuffer or LocoBuffer-II.</li>

        <li>On Windows O/S machines, be sure that the JMRI
        connection is set to use the correct COM port. Use Windows
        "Device Manager" to help determine which COM port your
        interface hardware is using, then verify that JMRI is
        configured to use that COM port.</li>

        <li>On Windows platforms, the COM port assignment can
        change if the interface hardware is moved from one USB port
        on the computer to another USB port. Avoid changing how
        your LocoNet-to-computer interface is connected to the
        computer.</li>

        <li>On Windows platforms, the COM port assignment can
        change if the interface hardware is connected via a USB
        hub. At Windows start-up, the computer can assign different
        COM port numbers to devices downstream of USB hubs, even if
        all of the USB hardware connected in the system has not
        been changed. Avoid connecting your LocoNet-to-computer
        hardware downstream of a hub. Note that a computer monitor

        <li>Some PR3 devices were shipped with poor quality USB

      <h4><a name="ErraticReadback" id="ErraticReadback">Erratic or
      Non-Functioning CV Readback</a></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Some mobile decoders will only allow proper Readback of
        CV values when there is a sufficient electrical load
        connected to the F0F (front headlamp) output connections or
        the motor connections. This means that an incandescent lamp
        or LED is properly connected to the front headlamp
        connection and functional. Other mobile decoders will only
        provide proper CV Readback when a motor is connected to the
        mobile decoder motor connections. Consult the documentation
        for your mobile decoder to determine what connections are
        required to allow proper CV readback.</li>

        <li>Some Digitrax hardware is capable of successful CV read
        and write operations on some mobile decoders but is unable
        to reliably read and/or write CVs for other mobile
        decoders. This problem is most obvious with sound decoders
        from some manufacturers. Some suggestions are listed here.

          <ul>
            <li>When using a Zephyr (DCS50) or Zephyr Xtra (DCS51),
            enable its "Blast Mode" programming feature. This will
            often allow correct writing of mobile decoder CV
            values.</li>

            <li>"Programming on the main" can allow a Chief (DCS100
            or DCS200) to properly write to difficult mobile
            decoder's CV values.</li>

            <li>A programming booster, such as the
            <i>SoundTraxx</i> <b>PTB-100</b> or the <i>DCC
            Specialties</i> <b>Power Pax</b> can often be used
            between the command station programming track
            connections and the programming track to allow
            successful read and write access of CVs on mobile
            decoders which do not allow Readback on a programming
            track connected directly to the programming
            hardware.</li>

            <li>Some PR3 users report that the PR3 programming
            track can successfully read and program sound decoders
            when the PR3 is powered using an 18 Volts DC power
            supply instead of a lower-voltage power supply such as
            the PS12 or PS14. <strong>Do this at your own
            risk!</strong> <em>Current Digitrax documentation for
            the PR3 defines a maximum input voltage of 15 Volts DC,
            where previously the maximum voltage was listed as 20
            Volts DC. Use of input voltages higher than 15 Volts DC
            could damage the PR3 hardware.</em></li>

      <h4><a name="TurnoutCmdHandling" id=
      "TurnoutCmdHandling">Command Station Turnout Command
      Rejection and JMRI Turnout Command Handling</a></h4>

      <p>Digitrax command stations pass LocoNet switch command
      messages to the DCC track signal so that track-connected
      accessory decoders can receive the switch commands. Digitrax
      command stations seem to buffer the switch requests and
      forward them to the DCC track signal in a way that does not
      have a noticeable impact on mobile decoder response to
      throttle control operations. This buffer is limited, and
      under conditions of heavy LocoNet switch command traffic, can
      overflow. When this happens, the command station will respond
      with a message (a <code>\&lt;LONG_ACK\&gt;</code> opcode)
      saying that it rejected (did not accept) the switch command.
      When the command station gives this response, the switch
      command is not placed into the buffer and is forgotten.<br>
      This can be problematic, depending on how the device which
      sent the switch command responds to the rejection message on
      LocoNet. Many LocoNet devices do not notice the rejection
      message, so do not attempt to re-send the switch command.
      Other LocoNet devices can pay attention to the rejection
      message and can wait a while before re-sending the message.
      Some LocoNet devices can be programmed either to resend the
      switch command if the rejection message is seen, or to not
      resend if the rejection message is seen.<br>
      This wide variety of behaviors can cause inconsistent or
      unreliable behavior of any device which relies on stationary
      decoder messages on the DCC track signal. Note that this can
      include devices which connect to LocoNet and which monitor
      the DCC track signal which is available on the LocoNet cable
      "RailSync" wires.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a name="turncmdhandsettings" id=
          "turncmdhandsettings">Turnout Command Handling
          Settings</a>

          <p>JMRI has various mechanisms to help handle these
          temporary LocoNet switch command buffer overloads. These
          mechanisms are controlled by the "Turnout Command
          Handling" option for each LocoNet-based connection. The
          four JMRI Turnout Command Handling options are described
          below.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Normal - the default setting, is recommended for
            the vast majority of layouts. In this mode of
            operation, JMRI will quickly retry the last LocoNet
            switch command seen before the command station's switch
            command rejection message, and will continue to repeat
            the switch command until a switch command is accepted
            by the command station. This quick retry can cause
            extremely high levels of activity on LocoNet.</li>

            <li>Spread - This mode is the same as "Normal",
            described above, except that JMRI implements additional
            delay between any switch commands which it sends to
            LocoNet. This should reduce the likelihood that JMRI
            commands would cause an overflow of the Digitrax
            command station switch command buffer, but does not
            have any effect on other LocoNet devices which generate
            LocoNet switch commands. The retry mechanism described
            above for the "Normal" mode is enabled.</li>

            <li>Once Only - This disables the JMRI retry mechanism
            for rejected switch commands. JMRI will not retry any
            LocoNet switch command messages. The amount of delay
            between any two JMRI-generated switch commands sent to
            LocoNet is the same as "Normal" mode.</li>

            <li>Both - This option both disables the JMRI rejected
            switch command retry mechanism and increases the delay
            between any two switch commands sent by JMRI to
            LocoNet.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These options do not take effect until the preferences
          are saved and JMRI is restarted.<br>
          None of these options can <i>guarantee</i> that
          <i>all</i> LocoNet switch messages <i>will</i> be passed
          to the DCC track signal.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a name="alternatives" id="alternatives">Avoidance
          strategies</a>

          <p>Some users may be able to reduce the likelihood of
          this problem occurring by allowing signal hardware to
          generate blinking signal aspects instead of programming
          JMRI to sequentially send "on" and "off" messages to the
          signal hardware.<br>
          Other users who do not have <i>any</i> hardware which are
          controlled by DCC stationary decoder messages on the DCC
          track signal (or on the LocoNet cable's RailSync wires)
          may decide to prevent the command station from forwarding
          <i>any</i> LocoNet switch control messages to the DCC
          track signal (and RailSync wires) by enabling the command
          station's "Bushby bit". Use the JMRI LocoNet <a href=
          "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/loconet/cmdstnconfig/CmdStnConfigFrame.shtml">
          Configure Command Station</a> tool, or the Roster-based
          mechanism for Command Station OpSw settings.<br>
          One good way to avoid this problem is to prevent the
          Digitrax command station from receiving the LocoNet
          switch control messages. This can be done by using only
          devices which send and/or receive switch control messages
          via the LocoNet data bus, and to implement a
          <i>standalone</i> LocoNet for use by those devices. This
          standalone LocoNet can be separately connected to JMRI so
          that JMRI can access the command station, throttles, fast
          clock, and other resources via one LocoNet connection,
          and access signals and turnouts via another LocoNet
          connection. This requires a separate LocoNet adapter for
          each connection. See <a href=
          "StandaloneLocoNet.shtml">Standalone LocoNet&reg;</a> for
          background, ideas, and suggestions for implementing a
          standalone LocoNet.</p>

          "cmdStationTrkPwrOff">Turnout command rejection when
          track power is off</a>

          <p>Some more recent Digitrax command stations will refuse
          to accept switch commands when track power is turned off.
          This can result in a "storm" of repeated switch messages
          on LocoNet if track power is off when switch messages are
          sent. This problem can be avoided by ensuring that track
          power is on when switch messages are to be sent.</p>

          <a name="multConnTurnoutReject" id=
          "multConnTurnoutReject">Turnout command rejection and
          multiple active LocoNet connections</a>

          <p>When JMRI has multiple active connections to a single
          LocoNet, it may be necessary to configure all but one of
          the active LocoNet connections for "Turnout Command
          Handling" type of "Only One", with one active LocoNet
          connection configured for one of the other "Turnout
          Command Handling" types. Failure to do this could cause
          the various JMRI LocoNet connection instances to
          independently attempt to resolve any turnout messages
          which have been rejected by the command station. This
          could result in a storm of turnout command retries on
          LocoNet.<br>
          Similarly, when multiple JMRI instances are working with
          the same LocoNet, only one JMRI connection to the LocoNet
          should be configured for a "Turnout Command Handling"
          type other than "Only One". Failure to do this could
          cause the various JMRI LocoNet connection instances to
          independently attempt to resolve any turnout messages
          which have been rejected by the command station. This
          could result in a storm of turnout command retries on
          LocoNet.</p>
