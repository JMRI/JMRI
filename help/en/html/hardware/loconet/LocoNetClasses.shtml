      <h1>Support: The JMRI LocoNet&reg; implementation</h1>

      <p>This page describes various high-level structures of the
      JMRI LocoNet&reg; implementation. Please also read the
      <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/package-summary.html">
      Javadocs for the jmrix.loconet package</a>.</p>

      <h2>LocoNet-specific values</h2>
      <p>The <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnConstants.html">
      LnConstants class</a> provides static, final constants to
      represent various fields and values in LocoNet messages. At
      some point, some of this should be built into to the specific
      classes (i.e. LocoNetMessage) so the coding and decoding
      algorithms don't have to appear in so many places.</p>

      <h2>Sending and receiving LocoNet messages</h2>

      <p>The <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LocoNetInterface.html">
      LocoNetInterface</a> class provides the basic connection to a
      LocoNet for user classes. Messages are sent by passing them
      to a LocoNetInterface implementation, and you can register
      with a LocoNetInterface to be notified of all LocoNet
      traffic.</p>

      <p><img src="images/LocoNetInterfaceUML.png" alt=
      "UML of JMRI's LocoNet Interface"></p>

      <p>The <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LocoNetMessage.html">
      LocoNetMessage</a> class represents the basic message.
      Currently (since July 2001), this class doesn't really help other
      code construct and decode LocoNet packets, but rather just
      contains them. This should be improved.</p>

      <p>The steps to send a message to the LocoNet are:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Create a <a href=
        "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LocoNetMessage.html">
        LocoNetMessage</a> object, and fill it with the message you
        want to send. It's not necessary to fill in the error-check
        byte; that will be done as part of sending.</li>

        <li>Locate an object providing a <a href=
        "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LocoNetInterface.html">
          LocoNetInterface</a> interface. In many cases, the
          <a href=
          "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnTrafficController.html">
          LnTrafficController</a> is providing this, and the object
          can be located with
          <pre>
        LocoNetInterface l = LnTrafficController.instance();
          </pre>
        <br><span class="since">Since <a href="/releasenotes/jmri4.11.6.shtml" target="_blank">JMRI 4.11.6</a></span>
        The
          <a href=
          "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnTrafficController.html">
          LnTrafficController</a> is connected to a given <a href=
          "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo.html">
          LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo</a>, and the
        object can be located with
          <pre>
        LocoNetInterface l = memo.getLnTrafficController();
          </pre>
          </li>

        <li>Send the message:
          <pre>
        l.sendLocoNetMessage(msg);
        
</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Classes that want to receive inbound LocoNet packets
      should implement the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LocoNetListener.html">
      LocoNetListener</a> interface, and register their desire to
      listen via an object with a <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LocoNetInterface.html">
      LocoNetInterface</a> interface. It's important to note that
      listener objects can't assume that they receive incoming
      LocoNet messages in any specific thread. In particular, they
      should not assume that they receive these messages in a GUI
      thread, so they'll have to forward any changes to the user
      interface.</p>

      <h2>Implementing the LocoNet connection</h2>

      <p>Implementing communication with a real LocoNet is handled
      by classes that implement the LocoNetListener interface.
      There are currently three (see below): <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnTrafficController.html">
      LnTrafficController</a> and its subclasses <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnPacketizer.html">
      LnPacketizer</a> and <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnTrafficRouter.html">
      LnTrafficRouter</a>.</p>

      <h3>LnTrafficController</h3>

      <p>The <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnTrafficController.html">
      LnTrafficController</a> abstract class provides some common
      implementation for it's subclasses, and adds a mechanism to
      find a usable LocoNetInterface implementation.</p>

      <p>The routine addLocoNetListener and removeLocoNetListener
      methods are implemented here, along with a notify method to
      forward LocoNetMessages to the listeners.</p>

      <p>Until JMRI version 4.11.5 the static instance() method
      was used by a large number of
      jmrix.loconet classes to find a LocoNetInterface for
      transmitting and receiving messages. It worked through a
      "self" static member, which was initialized when a
      LnTrafficController subclass object was created. All objects
      wanting to send or receive over the LocoNet will thence use
      the last-created LnTrafficController implementation.<br>
      See the section on "<a href="#startup">Startup</a>" for
      more information on this.</p><img src=
      "images/LnTrafficControllerUML.png" alt=
      "UML of JMRI's LocoNet Traffic Controller">

      <h3>LnPacketizer</h3>

      <p>The <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnPacketizer.html">
      LnPacketizer</a> class extends the LnTrafficController
      implementation to send and receive packets over a LocoBuffer
      serial link to a LocoNet. It works with an implementation of
      the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnPortController.html">
      LnPortController</a> - Abstract class, which works at the
      level of character streams. These communicate through Java
      streams which carry the LocoNet messages as character
      sequences. LnPortController implementations are available for
      the LocoBuffer, MS100 and for reading from a hex log
      file.</p>

      <p>It uses separate threads for transmission and reception of
      characters from the streams. The receive operation is done in
      a thread so it can easily stall when no messages are
      available. The transmit operation is done in a thread for a
      similar reason; sometimes a LocoBuffer will shut off input
      (output from the program), which causes the stream write
      operations to stall. By doing those in a separate thread, we
      can detect or at least bypass this without the entire program
      coming to a stop.</p>

      <h3>LnTrafficRouter</h3>

      <p>The <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnTrafficRouter.html">
      LnTrafficRouter</a> class provides a scatter-gather operation
      for the LocoNetListener interface. Note that this
      implementation doesn't transform the LocoNetMessages into
      serial traffic.<br>
      <img src="images/LocoNetConnections.gif" alt=
      "Drawing of how various objects route messages" width="640"
      height="480"><br>
      Note the LnTrafficRouter object. It provides a
      LocoNetInterface for all the LocoNet-using messages in the
      remote node, so that only one copy of each message has to
      travel across the remote link.</p>

      <p>Note that the "some remote comm class" could also be
      implemented as a subclass of LnTrafficRouter, instead of
      communicating with one. 
      <!-- This subclass from 2002 is no longer supported as of JMRI 4.3, see http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/package-tree.html (Egbert Broerse 2015)
<h3>LocoNetInterfaceScaffold</h3>
The 
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LocoNetInterfaceScaffold.html">LocoNetInterfaceScaffold</a> class provides a LnTrafficController implementation for use in test programs.
Rather than communicate with a real LocoNet, it provides scaffolding to 
make it easy to test the transmission and receipt of messages. --></p>

      <h2><a name="startup" id="startup">Startup</a></h2>
      <p>There are "action" classes that connect to an input source.
      The main program puts these in a menu, on a button, etc,
      so that the user can select the connection desired.<br>
      The current (March 2002) set is:

      <ul>
        <li>LocoBufferAction - creates a LocoBufferAdapter object
        and configures for operation with a LocoBuffer</li>

        <li>MS100Action - creates a MS100Adapter object and
        configures for operation with an MS100</li>

        <li>LnHexFileAction - creates an LnHexFilePort object and
        configures for operation as "LocoNet Simulator"
        (previously, this was known as "LocoNet Hex File", as it
        can load contents from a file of hexadecimal strings)</li>
      </ul>
      In addition to configuring the adapter for the input source,
      something has to configure the complete set of Manager
      objects and the LocoNet-handling objects. These include:

      <ul>
        <li>Typically a LnPacketizer, which becomes the "instance"
        for objects that use memo.getLnTrafficController() to
        locate an interface.</li>

        <li>A ProgrammerInstance</li>

        <li>A PowerManagerInstance</li>

        <li>A TurnoutManagerInstance</li>
      </ul>These last three provide LocoNet-based services for the
      higher-level JMRI interfaces.

      <p>The configure() methods in the various adapter classes do
      this. That's not a very general mechanism. Although a
      LnPacketizer is the right thing to connect to each of the
      serial port adapters, the rest of the configuration might
      vary.</p>

      <h2>Port adapters</h2><a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/loconet/LnPortController.html">LnPortController</a>
      is an abstract base class to carry common implementations for
      the Adapter classes that connect to serial ports with
      specific protocols.

      <h4>MS100</h4>
      <p>Note that the current MS100 implementation is
      not as robust as we really need it to be. In particular,
      back-off and retransmit is not being checked. Other interface
      devices, such as the Digitrax PR3, the LocoBuffer,
      LocoBuffer-II, and LocoBuffer-USB all implement an internal
      microcontroller which handles back-off and retransmit
      operations properly and are therefore preferred over the
      MS100.</p>

      <p>The MS100Action class (package jmrix.loconet.ms100) starts
      up a LocoNet connection via a MS100. When triggered, it
      creates a visible MS100Frame object.</p>

      <p>In turn, the MS100Frame creates an MS100Adapter object,
      then shows the available comm ports, allowing the user to
      pick one. The MS100Adapter object implements the
      LnPortController interface, so it can eventually connect an
      LnTrafficController to a serial port and MS100.</p>

      <p>When the "Open MS100 port" button is pressed, the
      MS100Frame object</p>

      <ul>
        <li>passes the selected communication port to the
        MS100Adapter. The MS100 adapter then creates a new
        LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo() object, connects to that port
        and creates input and output streams</li>

        <li>
        <span class="since">Since <a href="/releasenotes/jmri4.11.6.shtml"
        target="_blank">JMRI 4.11.6</a></span>
        then makes sure that a LnTrafficController object
        exists by calling the memo.getLnTrafficController() method<br>
        (providing multi-connection support and replacing the use of
        LnTrafficController.instance() used before)
        </li>

        <li>connects that LnTrafficController instance to the
        MS100Adapter (subclass of LnPortController)</li>

        <li>starts LnTrafficController in a new thread so that it
        can handle inbound messages asynchronously.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>LocoBuffer</h4>

      <p>Very similar to the MS100 case, with the same sequence of
      operations. The port setup is somewhat different. Classes are
      in the jmrix.loconet.locobuffer package.</p>

      <h4>HexFile</h4>

      <p>The HexFile classes (package jmrix.loconet.hexfile) are
      meant to simulate a LocoNet connection from a data file. They
      provide the "LocoNet Simulator" connection type. A
      hexadecimal format data file feeds in messages as if they
      came from an outside connection.</p>

      <p>Initialization is provided by the HexFileAction class.
      When triggered, it creates a visible HexFileFrame object.
      This provides a button the user can use to select an input
      file.</p>

      <p>When a file is selected, the HexFileFrame object</p>

      <ul>
        <li>creates a HexFileAdapter object connected to that
        file</li>

        <li>
        The HexFileAdapter adapter then creates a new
        LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo() object, connects to that port
        and creates input and output streams
        </li>

        <li>
        <span class="since">Since <a href="/releasenotes/jmri4.11.6.shtml"
        target="_blank">JMRI 4.11.6</a></span>
        then makes sure that a LnTrafficController object
        exists by calling the memo.getLnTrafficController() method<br>
        (providing multi-connection support and replacing the use of
        LnTrafficController.instance() used before)
        </li>

        <li>connects that LnTrafficController instance to the
        HexFileAdapter (subclass of LnPortController)</li>

        <li>starts LnTrafficController in a new thread so that it
        can handle inbound messages asynchronously.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Unlike the MS100Frame and LocoBufferFrame objects, the
      HexFileFrame object stays visible so that it can control the
      flow of messages from the file.</p>

      <h2>Slot and Programmer management</h2>

      <p>"Slots" are basic to the operation of a LocoNet command
      station. They are represented by the LocoNetSlot class. Like
      LocoNetMessage, this class does not (yet) provide a lot of
      support for creating and decoding slot status. The
      SlotManager class listens to LocoNet traffic to keep an
      up-to-date idea of the command stations slot contents. It ma
      someday be necessary for the SlotManager to actively
      communicate with the command station to update that
      information, but for not the SlotManager only listens to slot
      change commands that originate on the LocoNet or are
      transmitted from the program.</p>

      <p>The SlotListener interface should be implemented by any
      class that wants to be notified when a slot changes.</p>

      <p>Because Digitrax command stations handle programming via a
      special reserved slot, the jmri.Programmer interface is also
      implemented by the loconet.SlotManager class. This greatly
      complicates the class, but is acceptable for now.</p>
