      <h1>Hardware Support: Connecting to a Digitrax
      PR2</h1><a href=
      "http://digitrax.com/prd_compint_pr2.php"><img src=
      "images/PR2.jpg" alt="PR2 picture"></a><br>
      The PR2 is a standalone programmer that can be used to set
      CV's in all decoders that DecoderPro supports. It can also be
      used to download sound information into Digitrax sound
      decoders and, within its limited current capability, run one
      locomotive to test it.

      <p>To use it, you connect it to its power supply and to a
      dedicated piece of track which you'll use for a programming
      track. Also, connect the 25 pin RS232 connector to a serial
      port on your computer. You may have to use a USB to serial
      adapter, and/or a DB25 to DB9 connector adapter (The PR2 has
      a standard RS232 25 pin connector; most computers now have a
      9 pin RS232 connector, and there are simple adapters
      available to convert the wiring.)</p>

      <p>The PR2 is not a LocoNet&reg; interface, and does not
      connect to the LocoNet on your layout in any way. It cannot
      attach to a command station like the MS100, PR3, LocoBuffer,
      LocoBuffer-II, and LocoBuffer-USB do. The cable that comes
      with the PR2 is not a LocoNet cable, and you should not plug
      a LocoNet cable into the PR2.</p>

      <p>For more information on the PR2 itself, please see the
      <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/products/computer-control/pr2/">Digitrax
      PR2 page</a> and the <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/tsd/product/PR2/">PR2 support
      page</a> in the <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/tsd/">Digitrax Tech Support
      Depot</a>.</p>

      <h2>Recommended setup</h2>

      <p>To set up DecoderPro to use the PR2:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start DecoderPro.</li>

        <li>Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and
        configure the connection by selecting the Connections item
        at left and:

          <ul>
            <li>Select Digitrax as the Manufacturer</li>

            <li>Select the PR2 as the Connection</li>

            <li>Select the serial port that's connected to the
            PR2</li>

            <li>The speed will be fixed at 57,600 baud; don't try
            to change this in your computer's settings</li>

            <li>The "Flow Control" option defaults to "Use Hardware
            Flow Control", which uses the status leads in the
            serial connection to determine when the PR2 is ready to
            send and receive. You should try that first, as it is
            the most reliable mode. Only if you can't program
            decoders using that choice, and only after checking
            that you're using the right port, should you select
            "None" for this Preference field and try again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click Save at the bottom of the Preferences pane, quit
        the program and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Usage suggestions</h2>

      <p>You can use a JMRI throttle to control the locomotive
      connected to the PR2. Use the JMRI Power Control or the
      "Power" menu item on the Throttle's menu bar to turn on track
      power, and then you can operate the locomotive normally.</p>

      <p>The PR2 can only provide very limited current, so Digitrax
      has built a "neutral mode" into their sound decoders. When
      JMRI and the PR2 is running a Digitrax sound decoder, the
      motor is disconnected to reduce the current load. You can
      still ramp the speed up and down with the throttle and listen
      to how the sound responds, but the motor won't move the
      locomotive.</p>

      <p>Other decoders, including decoders from other
      manufacturers, may draw enough motor current to trip the PR2
      internal circuit breakers. This will cause JMRI to mark track
      power as "off". Just wait a couple seconds and turn the track
      power back on to recover.</p>
