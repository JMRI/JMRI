JMRI Hardware Guide: Connecting to a Digitrax PR2
</h1>

</a><br>
The PR2 is a standalone programmer that can be used
to set CVs in all decoders that DecoderPro supports.
It can also be used to download sound information into
Digitrax sound decoders and, within its limited current
capability, run one locomotive to test it.

<p>
To use it, you connect it to its power supply and to a 
dedicated piece of track which you'll use for a programming track.
Also, connect the 25 pin RS232 connector to a serial port on your 
computer. You may have to use a USB to serial adapter, and/or a DB25 to DB9 connector
adapter.  (The PR2 has a standard RS232 25 pin connector; most computers
now have a 9 pin RS232 connector, and there are simple adapters
available to convert the wiring.)

<p>
The PR2 is not a LocoNet&reg; interface, and
does not connect to the LocoNet on your layout in any way.
It cannot attach to a command station like the
MS100, PR3, LocoBuffer, LocoBuffer-II, and LocoBuffer-USB do. 
The cable that comes with the PR2 is not a LocoNet
cable, and you should not plug a LocoNet cable into the PR2.

<p>
For more information on the PR2 itself, please see the
<a href="http://digitrax.com/prd_compint_pr2.php">Digitrax PR2 page</a>
and the 
<a href="http://www.digitrax.com/kb/index.php?c=272">PR2 page</a>
in the 
<a href="http://www.digitrax.com/kb/index.php">Digitrax Knowledge Base</a>.

<h2>Recommended setup</h2>
<p>
To set up DecoderPro to use the PR2:
</p>

<UL>
<LI>
Start DecoderPro.
<li>
Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and configure the connection by:
<UL>
<LI>Select LocoNet PR2
<LI>Select the serial port that's connected to the PR2
<li>The speed will be fixed at 57,600 baud; don't try to change this 
in your computer's settings
<li>The "Flow Control" option defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which
uses the status leads in the serial connection to determine when the PR2
is ready to send and receive.  You should try that first, as it is the most
reliable mode.  
Only if you can't program decoders using that choice, 
and only after checking that you're using the right port, should you select "None" for 
this preference and try again.
</UL>
<li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window, quit the program and restart.
</UL>

<h2>Usage suggestions</h2>

<P> 
You can use a JMRI throttle to control the locomotive connected
to the PR2. Use the JMRI Power Control or the "Power" menu item 
on the Throttle's menu bar to turn on track power, and then you 
can operate the locomotive normally.  

<p>The PR2 can only
provide very limited current, so Digitrax has built a "neutral mode"
into their sound decoders.  When JMRI and the PR2 is running
a Digitrax sound decoder, the motor is disconnected to reduce the current load.
You can still ramp the speed up and down with the throttle and listen to
how the sound responds, but the motor won't move the locomotive.

<p>
Other decoders, including decoders from other manufacturers, may 
draw enough motor current to trip the PR2 internal circuit breakers.
This will cause JMRI to mark track power as "off". Just wait a couple
seconds and turn the track power back on to recover.
