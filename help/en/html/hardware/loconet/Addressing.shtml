LocoNet&reg; systems address input Sensors and output Turnouts using numbers.
This page describes how those numbers are defined in JMRI, and how they relate
to the numbers in other (hardware) systems.

<a name="turnout" id="turnout"></a>
<h2>Addressing LocoNet Turnouts</h2>
<p>
Inside packets on the LocoNet, output Turnouts are addressed with numbers from 0 to 4095.
Throttles, however, address these with numbers from 1 to 4096. To avoid user
confusion, JMRI uses the same numbering as the Throttles for Turnout System Names:  LT1 to LT4096.
<p>
Note that when the LocoNet Monitor panel shows the contents of the LocoNet packets
in text, it uses the same addressing, hence 1 to 4096.  This is then different 
from the raw bytes that are displayed, but at least it's consistent with what 
users expect to see.  We agree that's confusing, but there has to be some 
confusion somewhere, given the way this was set up.

<h3>The Turnout Table</h3>
<p>The JMRI Turnout Table shows a list of all Turnouts JMRI is aware of. Every 
    time JMRI sees a LocoNet message which specifies a Turnout, JMRI updates an 
    existing entry in the Turnout Table or creates a new entry if one does not already 
    exist.  Each Turnout in the table can also be assigned a "User Name".</p>
<p>The Turnout Table provides a useful snapshot of the current state of all 
    known Turnouts, and allows the user to change the state of those Turnouts.</p>
<p>Additional information on Turnouts and the Turnout Table may be found at the
    <a href="../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">main Turnouts page</a>.</p>

<h2>Addressing LocoNet Sensors</h2>

Inside packets on the LocoNet, Sensors are addressed with numbers from 0 to 4095.
Digitrax documentation refers to these as 1 to 4096, however.  Just like
Turnouts, we use the documentation numbering to define the Sensor System Names: LS1 to LS4096.
<p>
The simplest way to find the 
right number for a given Block is to open a "LocoNet monitor" window, and drop a 
locomotive onto the Block you're interested in.  You'll see the 
LocoNet message, complete with number, in the window that looks 
something like this:
<pre>
   General sensor input report: contact 161 (DS54 switch 81 Aux input) (BDL16 11,1) is Hi 
</pre>
The contact number, 161 in this case, is the address of the Sensor.
Prefix that with LS to get the Sensor System Name, e.g. LS161 in this case.
<p>
If you wish to manually enter in the hardware address to the system you can do it
by enter in the board number, followed by the channel number separated by a ":"<br>
So for a Sensor on board 11, channel 1 you would enter into the Hardware Address field : 
<b>11:1</b>
<p>
If you want to calculate the address of a BDL168 input, you can use:
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number = 16 * (board number) + (channel number) - 16
</code>
where "channel number" runs from 1 to 16.  For example, the first circuit
(number 1) on board 11 has number:
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number = 16 * (11) + (1) - 16 = 161
</code>
as we saw in the example above.
<p>
If you want to calculate the address of a DS54 aux input, use:
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number = 2 * (turnout number - 1) + 1
</code>
For example, the aux input associated with turnout 81 has number:
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number = 2 * (81 - 1) + 1 = 161
</code>
If it's the switch input, you add one more to that:
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number = 2 * (turnout number - 1) + 2
</code>
<p>For example, the switch input associated with turnout 12 has number:</p>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number = 2 * ( 12 - 1 ) + 2 = 24
</code>

<h3>The Sensor Table</h3>
<p>The JMRI Sensor Table shows a list of all Sensors JMRI is aware of. Every 
    time JMRI sees a LocoNet message which specifies a Sensor, JMRI updates an 
    existing entry in the table or creates a new entry if one does not already 
    exist.  Each Sensor in the table can be assigned a "User Name".</p>
<p>The Sensor Table provides a useful snapshot of the current state of all 
    known Sensors.</p>

    <a href="../../tools/Sensors.shtml">main Sensors page</a>.</p>

<a name="transponding" id="transponding"></a><h2>Addressing Transponding</h2>

<p>Digitrax Transponding is handled via the Reporter mechanism
in JMRI.  Reporters gather information from the layout and make it
available when it changes.  JMRI refers to Reporters using the System Name
<i>LRx</i> where <i>x</i> is a number which corresponds to a detection zone.</p>

<p>The Transponding zones are numbered sequentially from 1 to 4096.  Current 
    BDL16x hardware implements only odd-numbered Transponding zones.  The first 
    Transponding zone of a BDL16x board is reported as Reporter number 
    <span style="font-family: monospace">(1 +(board address -1) * 16)</span>. 
    The second Transponding zone of a BDL16x board is reported as Reporter number 
    <span style="font-family: monospace">(1 +(board address -1) * 16) + 2</span>.</p>
<p>Reporter numbering is summarized in the table below:</p>
    <table border="2">
        <tr align="center"><td>Board Address</td><td>Zone</td><td>Reporter Number</td></tr>
        <tr align="center"><td rowspan="8">1</td><td>A</td><td>LR1</td></tr>

<h3>The Reporter Table</h3>
<p>The JMRI Reporter Table shows a list of all Reporters JMRI is aware of. JMRI 
    creates an entry in this table for each new Transponding zone for which it sees a 
    Transponding message. Each Reporter in the table can be assigned a "User Name".</p>
<p>Once you have the Transponding hardware installed and at least one Locomotive
    transponding properly, it is simple to fill in the Reporter Table for each 
    Transponding zone by running the transponding Locomotive through all 
    transponding-capable zones. It may be convenient to fill in a "User Name"
    in the JMRI Reporter Table at the same time when the Locomotive first enters 
    each Transponding zone.</p>
<p>Additional information on Reporters and the Reporter Table may be found at the
    <a href="../../tools/Reporters.shtml">main Reporter page</a>.</p>

<a name="SVs" id="SVs"></a>
<h2>Addressing LocoNet device System Variables (SVs)</h2>
(The following was first fully available in
<a href="http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri4.1.2.shtml">JMRI 4.1.2</a>. Versions before
that may not be complete).
<p>
Like decoders store Configuration Variables (CVs) to hold their settings, 
some LocoNet-compatible devices have System Variables (SVs).
<p>
There are (at least) two variations of the protocol for accessing these.
JMRI can use version 1 or version 2 to access compatible SVs by selecting
"System Variable Type 1" or "System Variable Type 2" as the programming mode, respectively. 
This option is presented
when you're using a LocoNet System Connection that actually connects to a LocoNet, 
such as a LocoBuffer-USB or PR3 in MS100 mode.
<p>
SVs are numbered from 1 to 127 for version 1 hardware and from 1 to 2^16-1 = 65,535
for version 2 hardware.  Their names can be written in several formats:
<ul>
<li>nnnn, e.g. 12345 - Like regular CVs, this is the format to read and write an entire
byte.
<li>nnnnL, e.g. 123L - (version 2 only) This means read or write four bytes at a time. This is more
efficient for large variables, but note that you should be careful not to define overlapping
CVs that point to the same memory: having CV10L and CV12L present will cause confusion, 
as will having both CV12L and CV13 present.
<li>nnnn^HH, e.g. 123^80 - (version 2 only) This means a masked write.  Only the bits marked with a 1
in the two hex digits after the "^" character will be written to the device.  In the example case, that 
means just the most-significant bit will be written. The values of the other bits currently
in the device are not changed.
This is a bit subtle, so we provide some examples.
<table border="2">
<tr><th>CV<br/>Number</th><th>Prior<br/>Content</th><th>Value<br/>Written</th><th>Masked<br/>Value</th><th>New<br/>Content</th><tr>
<tr><td>CV1^01</td><td>0x55</td><td>0x22</td><td>0x01</td><td>0x23</td></tr>
<tr><td>CV1^01</td><td>0x54</td><td>0x22</td><td>0x01</td><td>0x22</td></tr>
<tr><td>CV1^0F</td><td>0x55</td><td>0x33</td><td>0x03</td><td>0x53</td></tr>
<tr><td>CV1^F0</td><td>0x55</td><td>0x33</td><td>0x03</td><td>0x53</td></tr>
<tr><td>CV1^33</td><td>0xF0</td><td>0x77</td><td>0x30</td><td>0x37</td></tr>
</table>
Note that, unlike the JMRI "mask" attribute, the value is not shifted over to match the mask bits.
This is perhaps best used for single bit values via enum variables, where the specified
choices can have the right bit coding.  Or don't use it at all, and rely on DecoderPro
to write the combined values of full words properly.
</ul>

<h3>SV version 1 board addressing</h3>
In some documentation, the SV version 1 protocol uses a two part address:  83/1, for example.
(SV version 2 uses a single number with up to 14 bits; 0 is not used)
There doesn't seem to be a standard way to map that to a single number.
JMRI maps A/B to (B-1)*256+A.  Most boards seem to use N/1 addresses, so this
makes that correspond to just N in JMRI.  To summarize:
<p>
<table border="2">
<tr><th width="80px">Old<br/>Style</th><th width="80px">JMRI<br/>Number</th>
<tr><td>10/1</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>83/1</td><td>83</td></tr>
<tr><td>83/2</td><td>339</td></tr>
<tr><td>83/0</td><td>-173</td></tr>
</table>
Note that N/0 addresses do special operations, and aren't really addresses:  They turn
the programming messages into commands.  They're available using negative numbers
as above, but they're really not recommended!

<h3>Using this in a DecoderPro "board" definition</h3>

You can use all of the DecoderPro tools to manage a board using the LocoNet SV protocol
if you provide an appropriate definition file.  These are in the same format as a 
decoder definition file, except that to specify the LocoNet SV Version 2 protocol you modify the
"programming" element to looks like:
<pre><code>
    &lt;programming direct="no" paged="no" register="no" ops="no"&gt;
        &lt;mode&gt;LOCONETSV2MODE&lt;/mode&gt;
    &lt;/programming&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>LocoNet SV Version 1 protocol is the same exception you specify LOCONETSV1MODE.
 For more information, see the 
 <a href="">schema definition file</a>.
 <p>
 Note that the version 1 protocol is no longer recommended.  If you're writing
 a decoder definition for a board that can use both, you should skip version 1 by
 providing just the LOCONETSV2MODE option.
