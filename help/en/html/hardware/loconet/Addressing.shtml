      <h1>General LocoNet Object Types and Addressing: "System Names" and "User Names"</h1>
      <p>LocoNet&reg; systems provide "general purpose inputs" via LocoNet "Sensors",
          provide "general purpose outputs" via either LocoNet-connected or DCC-connected
          "Turnouts", and provide "Reporter zone" numbers via LocoNet "Transponding zones".
          Each of these object types use independent addressing within LocoNet messaging.</p>
      <p>There is a direct relationship between an object's LocoNet
          address and one of two ways in which JMRI works with the object.  The object's
          JMRI "System Name" has this direct relationship.</p>
      <p>Alternately, JMRI allows the user to reference the object using a "User
          Name", which is a user-defined name for the object.  When referencing these objects
          within JMRI, one can generally use either the object's "User Name"
          or its "System Name" to reference the object.</p>
      <p>Use of these descriptive "User Names" to reference objects within JMRI can
          simplify development and debugging of JMRI "Signaling" configurations and
          "Logix Conditionals".  JMRI developers <strong>suggest</strong> that users make
          use of object "User Names" wherever possible.  Additional general
          information on JMRI "System Names" and "User Names" may be found <a
              href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml"> here.</a></p>

      <h2>System Names and LocoNet</h2>
      <p>JMRI communicates with the individual physical turnouts, sensors, reporters and other
          physical objects via individual "system names".  Each physical object which JMRI
          interacts with has a unique "system name". A typical JMRI system name is
          made up of a letter which indicates the connection type, plus another
          letter which indicates the type of object, plus one or more digits to
          indicate which specific object is being referenced.</p>
      <p>LocoNet system names typically look like "LT5", "LS2013", and "LR535".  These
          three system names represent <strong>L</strong>ocoNet <strong>T</strong>urnout
          <strong>5</strong>, <strong>L</strong>ocoNet <strong>S</strong>ensor
          <strong>2013</strong>, and <strong>L</strong>ocoNet <strong>R</strong>eporter
          <strong>535</strong>,
          respectively.</p>

      <p>It is important to note that JMRI generally treats each unique object "system name"
          as a separate object.  This means that the sensor with system name "LS9"
          is a separate entity from the objects referred to by the system names
          "LT9", "LR9", and "L2S9".  It is possible that specific LocoNet
          hardware imposes some specific relationship between various objects with
          the same address, but JMRI does not assume any relationship between
          them.</p>
      <p>Similarly, where a JMRI installation has more than one simultaneously-active LocoNet
          connection, JMRI will be configured with differing "prefix" information
          for each connection.  The unique prefixes are used in the JMRI system names
          to indicate which LocoNet connection the object refers to.  "LT5" refers
          to switch 5 on a system connection with prefix "L", while "L2T5" refers
          to switch 5 on a different system which has a prefix of "L2".  Those two
          independent system names denote two independently-controlled and independently-
          controllable turnouts on the two independent communication channels.</p>

      <h2><a name="tables" id="tables">JMRI Sensor, Turnout, and Reporter Tables</a></h2>

      <p>For user monitoring of these objects, and, as appropriate, user control of
          these objects, JMRI provides a "table" for each of these object types.
          These tables list all of the objects of a given type (i.e. "Turnouts")
          which are known to JMRI at a given time.  Each Table shows the System
          Name, User Name (if assigned) and State of each known object.  Additional
          configuration and comment information may also apply for some object types;
          where applicable, additional configuration buttons and  information fields
          may appear in the Table on the same line as a given object.</p>

      <p>LocoNet "Turnouts" are found in the "Turnout Table",
          LocoNet "Sensors" are found in the "Sensor Table",
          and LocoNet "Transponding Zones" are found in the "Reporters Table".
          Entries to these tables may be made manually by the user, or automatically
          when JMRI "sees" a LocoNet message which implies an object which is not
          already in the appropriate table.  A sample of a JMRI Sensor Table is shown
          below.</p>

      <img src="images/SensorTable.png" alt="An image showing a screen-capture of a sample Sensor Table" width="500">

      <h3><a name="SaveYourWork" id="SaveYourWork">Saving your changes</a></h3>

      <p>JMRI does not remember the Turnout, Sensor or Reporter table entries from
          a previous JMRI session unless you take specific action to save your
          information, and unless you take specific action to instruct JMRI to read
          the saved configuration.  (This is generally also true of the information
          in the other Tables.)</p>
      <p>JMRI "Panel files" are used to save the information from the "Tables".  A
          JMRI "Panel file" may also include information needed to display any
          JMRI "Layout Editor" panels and/or JMRI "Control Panel Editor" panels
          you have defined (this is the reason the file is called a "Panel file").
          Saving a "panel file" may be done from one of the "Tables" windows (i.e.
          "Turnouts", "Sensors", etc.) by selecting the "File" menu item and then
          selecting "Store", then either "Store configuration only to File..." or
          "Store Configuration and Panels to File...".</p>
      <p>JMRI provides a few different ways to automatically load a "panel file"
          at JMRI start-up.  The most-commonly used mechanism is via JMRI's "Start Up"
          "Preferences", which can be accessed via the JMRI "File" menu, then selecting
          "Start Up".  Simply select "Add", then "Open file...", and then select the
          file (or, if required, multiple files) to be opened at start-up.  Then
          select "Open".  It is then necessary to "save" the configuration profile
          to configure JMRI to use the new settings on next JMRI start-up.</p>
      <p>On subsequent JMRI invocations, all start-up actions are invoked,
          including any "start-up" actions you have defined to "Load" a "Panel File".</p>
      <p>If automatic reloading of the table entries is not desired, it is possible
          to manually read a panel file.  Under the JMRI "Panels" menu item, select
          "Open Panel..." and then locate and select one or more panel files
          containing the appropriate information.  Select the "Open Panels" button
          to read those files into JMRI.</p>
      <p>Note that JMRI panel files are typically specific to a given system
          connection.  If you have configured JMRI for multiple system connections,
          the panel file will typically be available only for the system connection
          in which it was created.</p>

      <h3>Adding an item to the table</h3>
      <p>From the Tables window, with the "object type" selected in the list at
          the left ("Turnouts", for example), select the "Add..." button which is
          found near the bottom of the window.  This opens a new window where you
          may enter the information for the new object.  If you are asked for a
          "Hardware Address", you should not specify a "System Name"; instead
          you should enter the "address" of the item you are adding - for example,
          "14" (without the quotes), to specify an object with hardware address "14".
          The tool will figure out the full "System Name" from the "System Connection"
          setting and the "Hardware Address" value.</p>
      <p>As an example of manually adding a LocoNet turnout, consider adding
          turnout number 34, and assigning the object the "User Name" "Yard
          throat 3/4 track switch".  This may be done via the "Turnout Table" by
          pressing the "Add..." button at the bottom of the table, then entering the
          information shown here.</p>
      <p><img src="images/AddNewTurnout.png" alt="Adding a LocoNet Turnout" width="550"/></p>
      <p>Activate the "Create" button to add the new entry into the "Turnout Table".</p>
      <p>When multiple "connections" are configured in the current JMRI Configuration
          Profile, the "System Connection" box allows selecting between the
          connections which are available.  JMRI will create a system name using
          a connection prefix which applies to the selected "system connection".</p>
      <p>Because an object's System Name must be unique, the tool will report an
          error message if you enter information which would duplicate a pre-existing
          object's System Name.</p>

      <a name="turnouts" id="turnouts"></a>
      <h2>Addressing LocoNet Turnouts</h2>

      <p>Digitrax throttles and JMRI use identical numbering for LocoNet turnouts.
          The "Hardware Address" number JMRI uses to refer to a turnout is exactly the
          same number as used when using a Digitrax throttle to control a "Switch".
          Digitrax documentation describes LocoNet turnout numbers as having a
          range from 1 to 2048.  JMRI uses a "System Name" to refer to the hardware
          object, and the "System Connetion Prefix" and "object type character" must
          be used in conjunction with the "Hardware Address" number to make a complete
          System Name for a LocoNet Turnout.</p>
      <p>For example, if a JMRI is configured for a single LocoNet connection, and
          that connection has the default "System Prefix" of "L", and a turnout
          on that LocoNet connection has an address of 12, then the associated
          JMRI System Name would be "LT12", where "<strong>L</strong>" is the
          "system connection prefix", "<strong>T</strong>" represents a "Turnout"
          object type, and "<strong>12</strong>" is the "Hardware Address" of the
          turnout.</p>
      <p>As another example, if a JMRI LocoNet connection has a user-defined system
          connection prefix of "GRAPE", and a turnout on that connection has an
          address of 12, then the associated JMRI System Name would be "GRAPET12",
          where "<strong>GRAPE</strong>" is the "system connection prefix", "T" represents a
          "<strong>T</strong>urnout" object type, and <strong>12</strong> is the
          "Hardware Address" of the turnout.  Note that if JMRI is configured for
          two connections, one with system connection prefix "L" and the other with
          system connection prefix "GRAPE", the JMRI system name "LT12" refers to
          a turnout object which is considered entirely separate from the turnout
          referred to by the object with system name "GRAPET12".</p>

      <h3>The Turnout Table</h3>

      <p>The JMRI Turnout Table shows a list of all Turnouts JMRI
      is aware of. Every time JMRI sees a LocoNet message which
      specifies a Turnout, JMRI updates the "known state" of an existing entry in
      the Turnout Table or JMRI creates a new entry if one does not already
      exist.  When JMRI automatically adds a Turnout Table entry in this
      way, it does so with a blank "User Name".  Users may update the "User Names"
      in the Turnout Table.  As noted <a href="#SaveYourWork">above</a>, it is
      helpful to save your Turnout Table changes so that you may re-load those
      updates into JMRI at a future time.</p>

      <p>The Turnout Table provides a useful snapshot of the
      current state of all Turnouts "known to JMRI", and allows the user to
      change the state of those Turnouts.</p>

      <p>Additional information on Turnouts and the Turnout Table
      may be found at the main JMRI <a href="../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnouts</a> page.</p>

      <h3>JMRI "Lights"</h3>
      <p>JMRI provides an object-type called "Lights".  For some DCC systems, "Light"
          objects are defined and addressed separately from "Turnout" objects.  LocoNet
          does not define a separate "Light" object.  To support "light" objects on LocoNet
          connections, JMRI maps its "Light" objects into equivalent LocoNet "Turnout" objects.</p>
      <p>This means that changing the state of a JMRI "Light" object with System
          Name "LL123" will actually modify the LocoNet turnout which corresponds
          to the JMRI turnout with System Name "LT123".</p>
      <p>Additional information on Lights and the Light Table
      may be found at the main JMRI <a href="../../tools/Lights.shtml">Lights</a> page.</p>

      <a name="sensor" id="sensor"></a>
      <h2>Addressing LocoNet Sensors</h2>

      <p>Digitrax throttles and JMRI use identical numbering for LocoNet sensors.
          The "Hardware Address" number JMRI uses to refer to a sensor is exactly
          the same number as is reported by some Digitrax throttles which can
          monitor for and display information from LocoNet sensor state messages.
          Digitrax documentation describes LocoNet sensor numbers as having a
          range from 1 to 4096. JMRI uses a "System Name" to refer to the hardware
          object, and the "System Connection Prefix" and "object type character"
          must be used in conjunction with the "Hardware Address" number to make
          a complete System Name for a LocoNet Sensor.</p>
      <p>For example, if a JMRI is configured for a single LocoNet connection,
          and that connection has the default "System Prefix" of "L", and a sensor
          on that LocoNet connection has an address of 12, then the associated JMRI
          System Name would be "LS12", where "<strong>L</strong>" is the "system connection prefix",
          "<strong>S</strong>" represents a "Sensor" object type, and "<strong>12</strong>" is the "Hardware Address"
          of the Sensor.</p>
      <p>As another example, if a JMRI LocoNet connection has a user-defined system
          connection prefix of "GRAPE", and a sensor on that connection has an
          address of 12, then the associated JMRI System Name would be "GRAPES12",
          where "<strong>GRAPE</strong>" is the "system connection prefix", "<strong>S</strong>" represents a
          "Sensor" object type, and "<strong>12</strong>" is the "Hardware Address" of the sensor.
          Note that if JMRI is configured for two connections, one with system
          connection prefix "L" and the other with system connection prefix
          "GRAPE", the JMRI system name "LT12" refers to a sensor object which
          is considered entirely separate from the turnout referred to by the
          object with system name "GRAPES12".</p>
      <p>The simplest way to find the correct number for a given Sensor is to open
          a JMRI "LocoNet monitor" window, and watch the window while causing a change
          to be reported by the sensor.  Look for an entry which shows a changing
          state which matches the activity.  For sensor which is used to detect block
          occupancy, remove all detectable equipment, then place a locomotive
          onto the chunk of track which is monitored by the block occupancy detector.
          Watch the messages in the monitor for a sensor message.  Then remove the
          equipment from the block to see the sensor change state again.  Confirm
          that the sensor number is consistent.</p>

      <p>The message shown in the LocoNet Monitor window will typically look
          something like this:</p>
          <pre>Sensor LS514 () is High.  (BDL16 # 33, DS2; DS54/DS64 # 65, SwiA/S1).</pre>
      <p>This message is interpreted to mean that The sensor with "System Name" of "LS514"
          and an undefined (empty) "user name" is currently "High".  In this particular
          case, the sensor is being used to report block occupancy detection, and
          "High" means that the block is "occupied".</p>

      <h3>The Sensor Table</h3>

      <p>The JMRI Sensor Table shows a list of all Sensors of which JMRI is
      aware. Every time JMRI sees a LocoNet message which
      specifies a Sensor, JMRI updates an existing entry in the
      Sensor table or creates a new Sensor entry if one does not already exist.
      Each Sensor in the table can be assigned a "User Name".  As noted <a
      href="#SaveYourWork">above</a>, it is helpful to save your Sensor Table
      changes so that you may re-load those updates into JMRI at a future time.</p>

      <p>The Sensor Table also provides a useful snapshot of the current
      state of all known Sensors.</p>

      <p>Additional information on Sensors and the Sensor Table may
      be found at the main JMRI <a href="../../tools/Sensors.shtml">
      Sensors</a> page.</p>

      <a name="transponding" id="transponding"></a>
      <h2>Addressing LocoNet Transponding Zones</h2>

      <p>Digitrax Transponding is handled via the Reporter
      mechanism in JMRI. Reporters gather information from the
      layout and make it available when it changes. JMRI typically refers to
      LocoNet Reporters using the System Name <i>LRx</i> where <i>L</i>
      is the system connection prefix for a LocoNet connection and <i>x</i> is
      a number which corresponds to a detection zone.  The system connection
      prefix may be different when multiple System Connections are configured.</p>

      <p>Within JMRI, <i>Transponding Zones</i> are numbered sequentially from 1 to
      4096. This differs from the way Digitrax throttles report Transponding
      zones.  If the "Find" feature is activated on a DT300x, DT40xx, or DT500x
      throtte, the display will report zones between 0 and 4095.  <strong>When comparing
      JMRI transponding zone numbers and Digitrax throttle-reported zone numbers,
      the JMRI transponding zone number is always one higher than the number
      reported by the Digitrax throttle</strong>.</p>
      <p>Current BDL16x hardware implements only odd-numbered
      Transponding zones.  The first Transponding zone of a BDL16x
      board is reported as JMRI Reporter number <span style=
      "font-family: monospace">(1 +(board address -1) * 16)</span>.
      The second Transponding zone of a BDL16x board is reported as
      Reporter number <span style="font-family: monospace">(1
      +(board address -1) * 16) + 2</span>.</p>
      <p>Reporter numbering is summarized in the table below:</p>

      <p>BXP88 devices implement sequential Transponding zone numbers.  The first
      Transponding zone of a BXP88 is reported as JMRI reporter number
      <span style="font-family: monospace"> (8 * (board address -1)) + 1</span>,
      and the last Transponding zone of a BXP88 is reported as JMRI reporter number
      <span style="font-family: monospace"> (8 * (board address -1)) + 8</span>.
      This numbering happens to match the BXP88 block occupancy Sensor numbering.
      If a BXP88 detection section reports its block occupancy via JMRI's LS45,
      then the transponding zone for that section will be via JMRI's LR45.</p>

      <h3>The Reporter Table</h3>

      <p>The JMRI Reporter Table shows a list of all Reporters JMRI
      is aware of. JMRI creates an entry in this table for each new
      Transponding zone for which it sees a Transponding message.
      Each Reporter in the table can be assigned a "User Name".  You may
      manually enter Reporter Table entries when you know the correct
      System Name for the reporter; it will be updated whenever a LocoNet
      message for that reporter is seen.</p>

      <p>Once you have the Transponding hardware installed and at
      least one Locomotive transponding properly, it is simple to
      fill in the Reporter Table for each Transponding zone by
      running a transponding-enabled locomotive through all
      transponding-capable zones. It may be convenient to fill in a
      "User Name" in the JMRI Reporter Table at the time when
      the Locomotive first enters each Transponding zone.  As noted <a
      href="#SaveYourWork">above</a>, it is helpful to save your Reporters Table
      changes so that you may re-load those updates into JMRI at a future time.</p>

      <p>Additional information on Reporters and the Reporter Table
      may be found at the main JMRI <a href=

      <h1><a name="deviceProg" id="deviceProg"></a>Addressing for LocoNet Device Programming</h1>
      <p>JMRI's LocoNet implementation makes use of a variety of other LocoNet-specific
          addressing schemes for programming LocoNet-based devices.</p>
      <a name="boardId" id="boardId"></a>
      <h2>Device "Board ID"</h2>
      <p>Some LocoNet-based devices may be configured with a "Board ID" number
          which allows computer-based device programming and often influences
          which LocoNet addressing a device uses.  Not all LocoNet devices have
          "Board ID" numbers.</p>

      <p>For example, a Digitrax DS64, connected on the LocoNet connection "L",
          and set for the "Board ID" 2 will default its outputs to be controlled
          by LocoNet turnouts at addresses 5 thru 8.  Within JMRI, the turnouts would be
          controlled by System Names LT5, LT6, LT7, and LT8.  When properly configured,
          the DS64's inputs will default to act as LocoNet "General Sensor" values at sensor
          addresses 9 thru 16 (and JMRI LS9 thru LS17), or as LocoNet "Turnout Feedback"
          values for turnout addresses 5 thru 8.</p>
      <p>JMRI requires use of Board ID value when configuring "Op Switch" values in
          BDL16x, DS64, PM4x, and SE8C devices.  This allows the JMRI device programming
          mechanisms to program only a single device, selected based on the device's
          Board ID value.</p>
      <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Board ID values have independent addressing ranges
          for each device type.  Board ID values for DS64 devices are independent from
          Board ID values for BDL16x devices, Board ID values for PM4x devices, and
          Board ID values for SE8C devices.  You may have one LocoNet which uses
          Board ID 2 for a PM42 device and a BDL16x device and a DS64 device and
          a SE8C device.  In this case, JMRI's device configuration tools will be
          able to configure the devices independently.  But the sensor, turnout,
          reporter, etc. objects of the devices <strong>may overlap</strong> each other.
          Be careful to choose Board ID values for each device such that no two devices
          implement addressed objects which overlap addressed objects of the same
          type but implemented on another LocoNet device.</p>

      <a name="SVs" id="SVs"></a>
      <h2>Addressing LocoNet Device "System Variables" (SVs)</h2>
      <p>(The following was first fully available in <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri4.1.2.shtml">JMRI
      4.1.2</a>. Versions before that may not be complete).</p>

      <p>Like decoders store Configuration Variables (CVs) to hold
      their settings, some LocoNet-compatible (non-Digitrax) devices implement System
      Variables (SVs).</p>
      <p>It is believed that Digitrax hardware does not make use of SVs, so users
          who only have LocoNet hardware produced by Digitrax may skip this section.</p>

      <p>There are (at least) two variations of the protocol for
      accessing these. JMRI can use version 1 or version 2 to
      access compatible SVs by selecting "System Variable Type 1"
      or "System Variable Type 2" as the programming mode,
      respectively. This option is presented when you're using a
      LocoNet System Connection that actually connects to a
      LocoNet, such as a LocoBuffer-USB or PR3 in MS100 mode.</p>

      <p>SVs are numbered from 1 to 127 for version 1 hardware and
      from 1 to 65,535 for version 2 hardware. Their names
      can be written in several formats:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>nnnn, e.g. 12345 - Like regular CVs, this is the format
        to read and write an entire byte.</li>

        <li>nnnnL, e.g. 123L - (version 2 only) This means read or
        write four bytes at a time. This is more efficient for
        large variables, but note that you should be careful not to
        define overlapping CVs that point to the same memory:
        having CV10L and CV12L present will cause confusion, as
        will having both CV12L and CV13 present.</li>

        <li>nnnn^HH, e.g. 123^80 - (version 2 only) This means a
        masked write. Only the bits marked with a 1 in the two hex
        digits after the "^" character will be written to the
        device. In the example case, that means just the
        most-significant bit will be written. The values of the
        other bits currently in the device are not changed. This is
        a bit subtle, so we provide some examples.

          value is not shifted over to match the mask bits. This is
          perhaps best used for single bit values via enum
          variables, where the specified choices can have the right
          bit coding. Or don't use it at all, and rely on
          DecoderPro to write the combined values of full words
          properly.

      <h3>SV version 1 board addressing</h3>In some documentation,
      the SV version 1 protocol uses a two part address: 83/1, for
      example. (SV version 2 uses a single number with up to 14
      bits; 0 is not used) There doesn't seem to be a standard way
      to map that to a single number. JMRI maps A/B to (B-1)*256+A.
      Most boards seem to use N/1 addresses, so this makes that
      correspond to just N in JMRI. To summarize:

      <table border="2">
        <tr>
          <th width="80">Old<br>
          Style</th>

          <th width="80">JMRI<br>

          <td>83/0</td>

          <td>-173</td>
        </tr>
      </table>Note that N/0 addresses do special operations, and
      aren't really addresses: They turn the programming messages
      into commands. They're available using negative numbers as
      above, but they're really not recommended!

      <h3>Using this in a DecoderPro "board" definition</h3>
      <p>You can
      use all of the DecoderPro tools to manage a board using the
      LocoNet SV protocol if you provide an appropriate definition
      file. These are in the same format as a decoder definition
      file, except that to specify the LocoNet SV Version 2
      protocol you modify the "programming" element to looks like:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    &lt;programming direct="no" paged="no" register="no" ops="no"&gt;
        &lt;mode&gt;LOCONETSV2MODE&lt;/mode&gt;
    &lt;/programming&gt;
</pre>

      <p>LocoNet SV Version 1 protocol is the same, except you
      specify LOCONETSV1MODE. </p>

      <p>Note that the version 1 protocol is no longer recommended.
      If you're writing a decoder definition for a board that can
      use both, you should skip version 1 by providing just the
      LOCONETSV2MODE option.</p>

        <p>Digitrax PM4, BDL168, SE8c and
        DS64 boards use a special messaging protocol to program their Op
        Switches.  JMRI supports this mode in Roster-based programming,
        so you can treat these types of boards in much the same way as
        you treat mobile decoders in your locomotives - you may program them
        using the JMRI "Symbolic" programmers (i.e. the Roster).</p>
        <p>Within the JMRI "Symbolic" programmer, the "decoder address" specifies
        the Board ID number assigned to the device being programmed.  Since the
        programmer uses the Board ID number, it is not necessary to re-wire your
        LocoNet when programming these devices.  The individual "Op Switches" are
        referenced using a designator which specifies a "device type number"
        and the OpSw number, with the two numbers separated by a ".".  For example,
        a CV numbered as "113.7" is a reference to a BDL16x device (i.e. 113),
        OpSw 7.  You may ignore the "device type number" when referencing CV
        numbers shown in the JMRI "Symbolic Programmer".

            access type and an Op Switch number, with the two parts of the designator
            separated by a ".".  For example, a CV numbered as "csOpSw.007" is a
            reference to a "command station OpSw" numbered "7".</p>
