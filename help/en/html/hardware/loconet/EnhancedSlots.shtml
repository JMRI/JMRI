      <h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>This help page is presented as a set of "questions and answers".  It is
      hoped that this presentation will answer the basic questions related
      to LocoNet "Enhanced" slots.</p>
      <h2><a name="QandA" id="QandA">Enhanced slots described via Questions and 
              Answers</a></h2>

      <h3><a name="generalideas" id=
      "generalideas">What is a LocoNet "Slot"?</a></h3>

      <p>LocoNet implements the "slot" as the basic mechanism for:
      <ul>
          <li>managing locomotives and the information used when sending a DCC 
              signal to that locomotive;</li>
          <li>managing how locomotives may be grouped together into a consist;</li>
          <li>other system-specific uses.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This discussion focuses on the first two of these items, and ignores the
      last item.</p>

      <h2><a name="WhatsInIt" id="WhatsInIt">What's in a slot?</a></h2>
      <p>Locomotive control and locomotive consisting slots are those slots which may
      contain valid locomotive information.  Valid locomotive information includes 
      the slot's status, a DCC mobile decoder address, the decoder's current 
      speed and direction, some stored information on which functions are active, 
      the type of DCC packet to be sent to the DCC mobile decoder, the "Throttle 
      ID" reported by the last throttle to acquire the slot, and position in a 
      consist (if consisted).</p>

      <h2><a name="whyImportant" id="whyImportant">Why are slots important?</a></h2>
      <p>When a LocoNet throttle acquires a locomotive address, it effectively asks
      the command station for a slot number with which to control a locomotive 
      address.  Once acquired, the throttle uses that <strong>slot number</strong>
      reported by the command station.</p>
    
      <h2><a name="whyDifferent" id="whyDifferent">Why is there a difference 
      between "traditional" and "enhanced" LocoNet slots?</a></h2>
      <p>Some guess that limited available memory in the microcontroller devices 
      used in early Digitrax command stations forced a limit of the available 
      number of slots and amount of information in each slot.</p>
      <p>Some guess that LocoNet designers worried about available data throughput
      on LocoNet if locomotive control messages required more bytes.</p>
      <p>While both of these arguments are logical, only the architects of LocoNet 
      can really know.  But it is known that the "traditional" slot architecture 
      placed a practical limit of up to 120 addressable locos (whether separately 
      controlled or consisted using "basic" consisting).  The "enhanced" slot 
      architecture has extended that capability to be greater than 120 in cases
      where the command station supports more than 120 locomotive-control slots.</p>
      
      <h2><a name="ExpandEnhanceEtc" id="ExpandEnhanceEtc">Why do you use the term
      "Enhanced" slots when Digitrax uses the term "Expanded" slots?</a></h2>
      <p>Upon its introduction, the primary DCS240 selling point seen by users 
      on the Digitrax-Users "Yahoo" list (now the Digitrax-Users "groups.io" list) 
      was the ability to use up to 400 throttles and control up to 400 locomotives.
      This association was well-established before the release of the DCS210 and
      DCS52 command stations.</p>
      <p>Why is this significant?  Because neither the DCS210 nor the DCS52 could
      control more locomotives than a "standard-slot-only" command station, nor 
      could they support any more throttles than such a command station.  But both
      command stations use and understand the LocoNet messages which makes it 
      possible for the DCS240 to support as many as 400 throttles and as many as 
      400 uniquely controllable locos.</p>
      <p>This emphasized that the so-called "expanded" slot is more than simply 
      a mechanism which allows a LocoNet-based system to use more than 120 throttles, 
      and allow the system to control more than 120 unique locomotives.  Instead,
      it is an "ecosystem" which allows different LocoNet messaging for loco control,
      different throttle "steal" behavior, different command station memory of 
      function states, etc.</p>
      <p>So, for the purposes of this discussion, an "enhanced" slot is one which 
      uses newer LocoNet messaging to implement the additional features listed 
      in the previous paragraph, regardless of the slot number value.  So-called 
      "enhanced" slot LocoNet messaging may use slot numbering in the "traditional" 
      slot numbering range, as is done by the DCS210 and DCS52 command stations, 
      or by the DCS240 if it is configured to limit its slots to a maximum of 120.  
      That same "enhanced" slot LocoNet messaging may use slot numbers in the 
      "expanded" slot numbering range to control those locomotives which are held
      in a DCS240 in a slot number which is above the "traditional" slot numbering
      range.</p>
      <h2><a name="PrimaryDiff" id="PrimaryDiff">What are the primary differences 
      between "Traditional" and "Enhanced" 
      LocoNet slots?</a></h2>
      There are four primary differences between "traditional" and "enhanced" 
      LocoNet slots:
      <table border="2">
          <tr><td align="center"><strong>Traditional slots:</strong></td>
              <td align="center"><strong>Enhanced slots:</strong></td></tr>
          <tr><td>use locomotive control slot numbers between 1 and 120 (or less, 
                  depending on command station), using a 4-byte message;</td>
              <td>use locomotive control slot numbers between 1 and 400 (or less, 
                  depending on command station), using 6-byte messages;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr><td>remember only F0 thru F8</td>
              <td>remember F0 thru F28</td>
          </tr>
          <tr><td>can be "shared" between multiple throttles;</td>
              <td>can be "stolen" by another throttle and the first enhanced-slot 
                  throttle no longer has control of the slot ("StealZap");</td>
          </tr>
          <tr><td>can be controlled by "traditional-slot" throttles or by 
                  "enhanced-slot-capable" throttles;</td>
              <td>can be controlled only by "enhanced-slot-capable" throttles;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr><td>can be managed by all Digitrax command stations.</td>
              <td>can only be managed by newer Digitrax command station models.</td>
          </tr>
      </table>
      
      <h2><a name="whatCmdStnsTrad" id="whatCmdStnsTrad">What command stations 
      implement "traditional" slots?</a></h2>
      <p>All LocoNet-compatible command stations implement traditional slots.</p>
          
      <h2><a name="whatCmdStnsEnh" id="whatCmdStnsEnh">What command stations 
      implement "enhanced" slots?</a></h2>
      <p>It is believed that a "LocoNet 2.0" specification defines the "enhanced" 
      slot functionality.  As of this writing, the Digitrax DCS52, DCS210, and 
      DCS240 command stations implement "enhanced" slot functionality.</p>

      <h2><a name="whatThrotTrad" id="whatThrotTrad">What throttles can make use 
      of "traditional" slots?</a></h2>
      <p>It is believed that all LocoNet-compatible throttles can make use of 
          traditional slots to control locomotives and/or consists.</p>

      <h2><a name="whatThrotEnh" id="whatThrotEnh">What throttles can make use 
      of "enhanced" slots?</a></h2>
      <p>As of this writing, the Digitrax DT402-series and DT500-series throttles 
      can make use of "enhanced" slots.  It is believed that the throttle must 
      be configured to allow it to request and use "enhanced" slots - if not 
      configured to use "enhanced" slots, or if the command station does not 
      support "enhanced" slots, the throttle will make use of "traditional" 
      slots.</p>
      <p>It is believed that those WiFi throttles managed by the Digitrax LNWI 
      device can make use of "enhanced" slots, assuming that the command station
      supports "enhanced" slots.</p>

      <h2><a name="whyNot" id="whyNot">JMRI does not directly support "enhanced" 
      slots.  Why not?</a></h2>
      <p>It's hard to support "enhanced" slots for a variety of reasons.
      Primarily, "enhanced" slots add a large number of "boundary conditions" that
      are difficult to manage.  And different Digitrax command stations seem to 
      behave differently when "enhanced" slots are used and certain "boundary 
      conditions" are exercised.  Until these boundary conditions are fully 
      understood, it has been deemed inappropriate to provide enhanced slot 
      support in JMRI.  This means that JMRI will not, at this time, control 
      locomotives or consists using "enhanced" slot LocoNet messaging.</p>
      
      <h2><a name="someSupport" id="someSupport">There really is some JMRI 
      support for "enhanced" slots.  Why is that?</a></h2>
      <p>A few JMRI developers have reverse-engineered the apparent behavior of some
      aspects of "enhanced" slot functionality.  As of this writing, that has been
      limited primarily to the "LocoNet Monitor" feature.  It has been thought that any 
      improper behavior of the "LocoNet Monitor" functionality at "boundary 
      conditions" would only give an incorrect display in the LocoNet Monitor 
      window but cannot cause JMRI to misbehave.</p>
      <p>As of this writing, other places where JMRI makes use of "enhanced" 
      slots is limited to usage where configuration and operations are done via 
      "enhanced" slot messaging.  Any improper behavior due to "boundary condition" 
      cases for these implementations is thought to not affect the ability of JMRI 
      to control trains.</p>

      <h2><a name="whatItWillTake" id="whatItWillTake">What will it take for 
      JMRI to fully support "enhanced" slots?</a></h2>
      <p>There are a few things at play here.  At a minimum, JMRI will require:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>greater understanding by JMRI developers of the behavior of command 
          stations and throttles, for various boundary conditions, across different 
          command station and throttle implementations;</li>
          <li>an understanding of proper JMRI behavior when both enhanced and 
          traditional slots are used;</li>
          <li>an understanding of how slots "transition" between traditional and
          enhanced;</li>
          <li>some "refactoring" of JMRI's LocoNet code base, to allow for easy 
          management of the "enhanced" slot type;</li>
          <li>a mechanism to provide the user some level of control of enhanced
          slot usage (when enhanced slots are available);</li>
          <li>a re-work of the LocoNet "Monitor Slots" tool to handle the 
          potentially huge number of enhanced slots.</li>
      </ul>
