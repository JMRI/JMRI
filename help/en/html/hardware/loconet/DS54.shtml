      <h1>Hardware Support: DS54 Examples</h1>

      <p class="subtitle">Examples of using a Digitrax DS54 with
      JMRI.</p>

      <p>The Digitrax DS54 accessory decoder can be configured in a
      large number of ways (<a href=
      "../../../manual/index.shtml">DecoderPro</a> can help with
      that).</p>

      <p>Walter Thompson walked through the details of this:</p>

      <p>With the DS54 at defaults these are the LocoNet&reg; msgs
      when either Switch A or Aux A goes positive causing the
      Turnout to "toggle" state:<br>
      When Switch A (blue lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 70
      35].<br>
      When Aux A (orange lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 50
      15]</p>

      <p>I then set "When Switch A input changes, send" ="Turnout
      feedback msg"<br>
      When Switch A (blue lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 70
      36]<br>
      When Aux A (orange lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 50
      15]</p>

      <p>I then set "When Aux A input changes, send"= "Turnout
      feedback message"<br>
      When Switch A (blue lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 70
      36]<br>
      When Aux A (orange lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 50
      16]</p>

      <p>Therefore, when the Switch and Aux inputs are set to send
      a turnout feedback message, the feedback mechanisms built
      into recent versions of JMRI can be used to track the turnout
      state when the local inputs are used to change the
      turnout.</p>

      <h2>Exact Feedback</h2>

      <p>To use exact feedback, you need to connect two
      microswitches to the turnout and to the Switch and Aux inputs
      on the DS54. (You can use the built in Tortoise contacts for
      this)</p>

      <p>Configure the DS54 channel with:</p>
      <pre>
 Aux A input"='Active ON, trigger on change, Positive Level"
 Aux A task"="No Output change"
 When Aux A input changes, send"= "Exact turnout feedback message"
 Switch A input"='Active ON, trigger on change, Positive Level"
 Switch A task"="No Output change"
 Switch A input changes, send"= "Exact turnout feedback message"
</pre>

      <p>Configure Turnout LT9 (via the Turnout Table) to use
      "EXACT" feedback.</p>

      <h1>Programming the DS54</h1>

      <p>The DS54 CV values can be programmed via JMRI using the
      JMRI programming tools using the "Service Mode" programming
      track. This requires a JMRI connection to a command station,
      and the DS54's track inputs must be connected to the
      programming track. As described in the DS54 documentation, it
      is necessary to connect a 100 Ohm 2 Watt resistor between one
      of the programming track rails and the "Yellow" input wire of
      one of the DS54's output connectors. It is also necessary to
      disconnect all other input signal sources.</p>

      <p>Once the connections described above have been made, place
      the programming jumper across the programming jumper pins and
      open the JMRI "Service-Mode Programmer" tool. Navigate to the
      "Digitrax" entry, and select DS54 as the decoder type, and
      press the "Open Programmer" button. You may then read and
      write the CVs just like any mobile decoder.</p>

      <p>When ready to place the DS54 back in normal service,
      disconnect the programming track connections and programming
      resistor, and be sure to remove the programming jumper.</p>

      <h1>DS54 Wiring</h1>

      <p>It is strongly recommended that when multiple DS54s are
      used, that they be connected to the track wires with
      consistent phasing. In other words, all DS54 devices should
      connect the RailA connection to the same terminal position on
      the DS54, and that all DS54s connect the RailB connection to
      the <i>other</i> terminal position. This is important to
      ensure that there is not an unexpected current flow on the
      LocoNet cable due to out-of-phase connections on the DS54
      track connections. Note that this means that the DS54 track
      connections should <i>not</i> be made using track power that
      is from an <i>autoreversing</i> power district.</p>

      Digitrax components</a>.</p>
