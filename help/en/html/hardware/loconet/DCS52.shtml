      <h1>Hardware Support: Connecting to a Digitrax DCS52</h1><br>

      <p>JMRI may be connected to the Digitrax DCS52 in any
      of a wide variety of ways.  Since the DCS52 has a built-in USB interface,
      it is possible to simply plug a USB cable into the computer and the DCS52,
      and configure JMRI to suit this connection.  It is also possible to use
      another LocoNet interface device, such as a LocoBuffer-USB, Digitrax PR3,
      or Digitrax PR4, to interface a computer to LocoNet, and connect that LocoNet
      to the DCS52.  JMRI does not prefer any one connection method over any
      other method.  Choose one which is suitable for your needs.</p>

      <p>If a USB cable is used to connect the JMRI computer to the DCS52's USB
      connection, JMRI may be configured in one of two modes.  If the computer
      will only be used for decoder programming, and JMRI will not need access to
      LocoNet features other than the DCS52 "programming track", then JMRI may
      be configured to use a "connection" where the DCS52 USB interface is
      placed into a mode where it acts as a standalone decoder
      programmer.  In this mode, JMRI will access the DCS52 dedicated
      programming track connections.  This mimics the "standalone programmer"
      configuration which the PR2 provides, and which the PR3 and PR4 can support.</p>

      <p>Alternately, when JMRI will be used to access LocoNet resources which
      go beyond simply the DCS52 programming track, then JMRI should be configured
      to act as a general-purpose LocoNet interface.  The JMRI "connection" should
      be configured so that the "command station" type specifies the type of
      command station which is being used.</p>

    <p>The table below summarizes these possibilities.</p>
      <table border="3">

      </table>

      <p>Note that it is possible to use the DCS52 in a "booster" mode, and rely upon
      some other command station.  If this configuration is used, the "command station"
      specified for the JMRI connection should match the device which is actually
      acting as the command station.</p>

      <h2>Choosing the configuration profile "command station" setting</h2>

      <p>When setting up a JMRI "connection profile", which "command station" should
      you use when configuring JMRI?  That depends on what you
      intend to do with JMRI.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>If you will <em>only</em> use JMRI to program decoders on
      the dedicated programming track, then configuring the connection for the
      "command station" type of "DCS52 Standalone Programmer" mode
      is a good choice.  In this mode, JMRI will be able to read and write decoder
      CV values.  In this mode, you may also use a JMRI throttle to select and
      control the locomotive on the dedicated programming track, subject to the
      ability of the DCS52 to supply sufficient current to the decoder.  JMRI will
      <em>not</em> be able to access LocoNet peripherals and JMRI throttles will <em>not</em>
      be able to control decoders via the "main track".</li>

      <li><p>If you wish JMRI to be able to control decoders via the DCS52 main track
      outputs, and access LocoNet devices, then configuring the connection for the
      "command station" type of "DCS52 Standalone Programmer" mode
      is a good choice.  In this mode, JMRI is able to control decoders connected
      via the main track outputs and access LocoNet devices.   JMRI may also
      perform decoder programming via the dedicated programming track, but JMRI
      throttles will <em>not</em> be able to run decoders which are on the dedicated
      programming track.</p></li>
      <li>If you think that both modes may be useful to you, you should consider
      setting up <em>two</em> configuration profiles.  Then, when you start
      JMRI, you may select the configuration profile which suits the way you want
      to use JMRI.  And to switch to the other mode, you may simply quit JMRI and
      re-start it, and select the other profile, so that you may perform the other
      type of work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>DCS52 USB interface as a stand-alone decoder programmer</h2>
      <p><img src="images/DCS52StandaloneProgrammerConnections.png"
              alt="Typical connections for DCS52 for use as standalone programmer"
              width="300"></p>

      <p>When the DCS52 USB interface is configured to act as a programmer, it acts
      upon the dedicated programming track via the "programming track" connections
      on the DCS52. When JMRI is properly configured, JMRI
      can use the DCS52 programming track to access decoder CVs when the decoder is
      connected to the programming track.</p>

      <p>This JMRI configuration may also be used to download sound information into
      Digitrax sound decoders and, within its limited current
      capability, run one locomotive to test it. When used with
      Digitrax SFX decoders, "neutral mode" allows you to vary the
      speed without the motor moving the decoder, so you can hear
      how the locomotive sound reacts to varying speeds.</p>

      <p>In this mode of operations, JMRI will not have access to LocoNet-based
      devices.</p>

      <h3>Setup for the DCS52 acting as a standalone programmer</h3>

      <p>To use the DCS52 programming track, connect the DCS52 to its
      power supply and connect a dedicated piece of track which you'll
      use as the programming track to the DCS52 "programming track"
      terminals. Finally, connect a USB cable
      between the DCS52 and your computer.</p>

      <p>To set up JMRI to use the DCS52 via the dedicated
      decoder programming track mode:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start the program.</li>

        <li>Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and
        configure the connection by:

          <ul>
              <li>For the "<strong>System Connection</strong>" setting, select "DCS52 USB Interface"</li>

            <li>Under "<strong>Serial Port</strong>", select the serial port that's connected to the
            DCS52</li>

            <li>In the "<strong>Command station type</strong>" option,
            select the type of command station you've got on your
            LocoNet. Typically, this will be "<code><strong>DCS52
            USB Interface as standalone programmer</strong></code>".</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the speed will be fixed
            at 57,600 baud.</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the "Flow Control" option
            defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which is the
            preferred setting for the DCS52. You should try that
            first, as it is the most reliable mode. Only if you
            can't reliably program decoders using that choice, and
            only after checking that you're using the right port,
            should you select "None" for this preference and try
            again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window,
        quit the program and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The "connection" preferences should look similar to this image:</p>
      <img src="images/DCS52StandConnProfile.png" alt="Sample configuration profile with DCS52 USB interface as a standalone programmer" width="500">

      <h3>DCS52 USB Interface in Standalone Programming Mode Usage Hints</h3>

      <ul>
          <li>You can use a JMRI throttle to control the locomotive
      connected to the DCS52 Programmer track. Use the JMRI Power Control
      or the "Power" menu item on the Throttle's menu bar to turn
      on track power, and then you can operate the locomotive
      normally via a JMRI throttle.</li>

      <li>The DCS52 can only provide very limited current to the programming track, so Digitrax
      has built a "neutral mode" into their sound decoders. When
      JMRI and the DCS52 is running a Digitrax sound decoder, the
      motor is disconnected to reduce the current load. You can
      still ramp the speed up and down with the throttle and listen
      to how the sound responds, but the motor won't move the
      locomotive.
      <ul>
          <li>To implement that "neutral mode" described
      above, the DCS52 automatically writes CV128 to 0 or 1. This
      happens when a JMRI throttle is used to run the locomotive on
      the DCS52 programming track, and there's nothing JMRI can do to
      prevent it. Unfortunately, this can interfere with the CV
      programming on some non-Digitrax decoders. For example, it
      will set the "Master Volume" CV128 on some SoundTraxx
      decoders to a very low volume.</li>

      <li>If you are working with a decoder that uses CV128
      for something, you should either not use a JMRI throttle to
      run the locomotive on the DCS52 programming track, or remember
      to rewrite CV128 with the right value just before removing
      the locomotive from the track.</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li>Other decoders, including decoders from other
      manufacturers, may draw enough motor current to trip the DCS52
      internal circuit breakers. This will cause JMRI to mark track
      power as "off". Just wait a couple seconds and turn the track
      power back on to recover.</li>

      <li>If the DCS52 is in its "Decoder CV programming" mode and JMRI is used to
          access decoder CVs, then the DCS52 display may show programming-related
          information that is not strictly accurate.  This is because the DCS52
          cannot easily discriminate between CV accesses made via its keypad and
          CV accesses made via other sources.</li>

      <li>It is possible run trains via the DCS52 controls and/or LocoNet-based
          throttles  when JMRI is programming a decoder on the DCS52 programming track.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>DCS52 USB interface as a LocoNet Interface</h2>
      <p><img src="images/DCS52LocoNetInterfaceConnections.png"
              alt="Typical connections for DCS52 acting as a LocoNet interface"
              width="300"></p>

      <p>When acting as an interface, the DCS52 USB connection allows JMRI to
      interact with devices connected to LocoNet. This includes
      programming decoders on a programming track attached to a
      LocoNet command station. Where the LocoNet command station
      supports "programming on the main", JMRI is able to make use
      of that feature.</p>

      <h3>Setup for the DCS52 acting as a LocoNet interface</h3>
      <p>To use the DCS52 USB connection as a LocoNet interface, connect a LocoNet cable to
      a LocoNet connector on the DCS52. Connect an appropriate power
      supply to the DCS52, per the Digitrax instructions for the DCS52.  The
      DCS52 USB interface will not be able to communicate with LocoNet unless
      the DCS52 is properly powered. Finally, connect an appropriate USB cable between the
      DCS52 USB connector and your computer.</p>

      <p>To set up a JMRI application to use the DCS52 as an
      interface to a LocoNet which includes a LocoNet command
      station:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start the program.</li>

        <li>Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and
        configure the connection by:

          <ul>
              <li>For the "<strong>System Connection</strong>" setting, select "DCS52 USB Interface"</li>

            <li>Under "<strong>Serial Port</strong>", select the serial port that's connected to the
            DCS52</li>

            <li>In the "<strong>Command station type</strong>" option,
            select the type of command station you've got on your
            LocoNet. Typically, this will be "<code><strong>DCS52
            (Zephyr Express command station)</strong></code>", but, if you have configured
            your DCS52 to act only as a booster, you should select the command
            station option which matches the active command station.</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the speed will be fixed
            at 57,600 baud.</li>

            <li>In the advanced settings, the "Flow Control" option
            defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which is the
            preferred setting for the DCS52. You should try that
            first, as it is the most reliable mode. Only if you
            can't reliably program decoders using that choice, and
            only after checking that you're using the right port,
            should you select "None" for this preference and try
            again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window,
        quit the program and restart.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The "connection" preferences should look similar to this image:</p>

      <img src="images/DCS52LocoNetInterfaceConnProfile.png" alt="Sample configuration profile with DCS52 USB interface as a LocoNet interface" width="500">

      <h2>DCS52 connected via some other LocoNet Interface</h2>
      <p>JMRI may connect to the LocoNet via a LocoNet interface other than the
      DCS52 USB connector.  When connected in this fashion, see the
      JMRI documentation associated with the LocoNet interface which is being
      used.</p>

      <h1>Drivers</h1>

      The DCS52 needs to have a driver installed when used with any Microsoft
      Windows Operating System.  See the Digitrax
      <a href=
         "http://www.digitrax.com/downloads/">"Downloads"</a> page for drivers.
      At the time this help page was written, Digitrax provides Windows drivers
      for the PR3 device.  Those drivers are suitable for use with the DCS52.
      Make sure to follow any instructions, particularly any instructions
      about the order of installing the drivers and plugging in the
      device.

      <p>You don't need to install a separate driver when using
      current versions of Mac OS X or Linux.</p>
