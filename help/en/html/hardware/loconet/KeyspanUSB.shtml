      <h1>Hardware Support: Keyspan USB connections</h1>

      <p>This page describes tests of two USB serial adapters with
      the Digitrax MS100 LocoNet&reg; interface.</p>

      <p>The MS100 is a passive level shifter that gets its power
      from the control leads in the RS232 interface. Digitrax has
      not published a schematic, but Bill Robinson of Team Digital
      has graciously provided a schematic of their level shifter
      which is thought to be very similar.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, this adapter is no longer made. We
          believe that the replacement "Keyspan High Speed Serial
          Adapter" Part# USA-19QW is the same unit.</p>

          <p>We've had a report that this PDA adapter can't work
          with a LocoBuffer at 57,600 baud. There seem to be
          multiple versions of the adapter, with slightly different
          model numbers, and it could be that some of them will
          only work to 56,000 baud.</p>

        <dd>Problems: the USB adapter provides only one control
        line output, and the serial port outputs were only +/- 5V.
        This was not enough to power the MS100 during receive.</dd>

          <p>This was actually the second USB serial adapter I
          tried, after the Keyspan Dual Serial Adapter (see below).
          This adapter provides a DB9 male plug, pinout available
          from the <a href=
          "http://www.keyspan.com/products/USB/PDAadapter/docs/mac/html/homepage29.html">
          Keyspan product support page</a>. Note that there are
          both RTS and DTR outputs; these can be separately
          controlled to provide + and - voltage to the MS100.</p>

          <p>I connected it through a DB9 female to DB25 male
          adapter cable that I happened to have, and the test
          program was immediately able to communicate with the
          LocoNet.</p>

        <dt class="left">Summary: This did not work.</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The initial problem was that the USB adapter provides
          only one control line output (see pinout on the <a href=
          "http://www.keyspan.com/products/USB/usa28x/docs/swp/aPinOuts.html">
          Keyspan product support page</a>. This means that the
          serial port can only provide one of the two + and -
          levels needed for the MS100. Since there are two ports, I
          build a small adapter to use the control line from the
          second port to provide the other level.</p>

          "Keyspan USA-28X did not function">(click to
          enlarge)</a></p>

          <p>The second problem was that the serial port outputs
          were only +/- 5V. This was not enough to power the MS100
          during receive.</p>

          <p>The following picture shows the transmit data levels
          from the Keyspan adapter. DC levels had similar ranges.
          This was a large enough swing to drive the LocoNet
          itself, but not to power the receive level shifter in the
          MS100.</p>

          <p><a href="./images/KeyspanTxD.jpg"><img src=
          "./images/KeyspanTxD-thumb.jpg" alt=
          "Oscilloscope image showing Keyspan USA-28X TxD voltages">
          (click to enlarge)</a></p>

          <p>Providing auxiliary +/- 9V power to the MS100, without
          using the output lines as a power source, was not
          sufficient. The following picture is the received data,
          nominally an RS232 signal of at least +/-6 volts, from
          the MS100. The received data signal was getting up to 6V,
          marginally OK, but it was not going below ground. The USB
          serial adapter was not reporting any received characters
          to the Macintosh.</p>

          <h3>Hardware &amp; Software used</h3>

          <p>The tests were done with a PowerBook G4 400MHz, Mac OS
          9.1. The test program was a Java application created with
          CodeWarrior 4.1.0.3 build 661. This program is available
          on request, see below for address. Java access to the USB
          serial adapters was via Patrick Beard's Macintosh
          implementation of javax.comm.</p>

          <p>The Digitrax system was a Chief, DT100IR throttle, and
          various decoders on the layout. Traffic from command
          station, throttle and various auxiliary components (PM4,
          DS54) was available for testing.</p>
