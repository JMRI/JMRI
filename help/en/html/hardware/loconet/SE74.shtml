      <h1 id="general">Using the SE74 with JMRI</h1>
    <p>The Digitrax SE74 provides a variety of features which may be used with JMRI.
      JMRI-supported features include signal control, switch control, and inputs.

      <h2 id="configuring">Configuring the SE74 with JMRI</h2>
      <p>JMRI is not able (at this time) to provide "configuration" of the SE74.
      Digitrax introduced a different configuration mechanism with the generation of
      devices which includes the DS74.  JMRI developers have not yet provided support
      for this new methodology, in part because it includes a mode which extends to
      non-LocoNet systems, but behaves in a way that is not consistent with other
      products which use a similar mechanism.
      <p>As such, configuring the SE74 must be done using the methods described
      in the Digitrax documentation for the SE74.

      <h2 id="signaling">Signaling using the SE74 with JMRI</h2>

      <p>The SE74 has two mutually-exclusive operating modes which determine how JMRI
      can control the signal heads.  As such, these instructions present two different
      ways of configuring JMRI to control the SE74 - one for each SE74 operating mode.
      One method is "SE8C-compatible" mode.  The other is "Aspect" mode.

      <p>The "Turnout" mode of controlling signals makes use of Turnout control
      messages to convey the "aspect" information to the hardware.  It operates in
      the same way as the SE8C device does, and JMRI support for this mode of operation
      is the same as when using the SE8C device.

      <p>Alternately, control of SE74 signal heads is via an "Aspect".  This mechanism
      uses different LocoNet messaging than SE8C mode, and requires different support
      in JMRI.  SE74 "aspect" mode signaling has a few benefits over SE8C mode.  SE74
      users are encouraged to make use of this mode of SE74 operation.

        <h3 id="aspectsig">Signaling when the SE74 is in "aspect" mode</h3>
        <p>The SE74 offers an alternate mode for controlling signal head appearance.
        In the SE74 documentation, Digitrax refers to this mode as "aspect" mode.
        Control of each individual signal head is via DCC "Extended Accessory Decoder"
        packets.  LocoNet-connected SE74 devices may get their control information
        directly from the LocoNet messaging, rather than from the DCC track signal.

        <p>The DCC "Extended Accessory Decoder" messaging uses an "address space"
        which is independent of the addressing used for turnout control messaging.
        As such, a turnout with address 260 <em>does not</em> conflict with a
        SE74 signal head at "aspect"-mode signaling address 260!  This also makes it
        easier to configure SE74 addressing in a way that does not conflict with
        other "turnout"-type objects associated with the layout.

        <p>When an SE74 is operating in "Aspect" mode and it sees such a message
        which is addressed to one of its signal heads, it extracts the aspect
        number from the message and updates the addressed head to reflect the
        aspect associated with the aspect number.

        Note specifically that the "Aspect" mechanism Digitrax uses is controlled
        at the level of the "Signal Head".  This design choice provides compatibility
        with some 3rd-party LocoNet signaling hardware.  And it means that JMRI
        does not require SE74-specific support in its signaling implementation.  It
        also means that changing the aspect of a mast which has more than one head
        can require more than one message to be issued when the aspect changes.
        (When a JMRI Signal Mast's aspect changes, the JMRI implementation will
        send a message to each Signal Head associated with the Signal Mast, regardless
        of whether the head aspect has changed).

        <p>This SE74 behavior is notably different from the behavior seen in some
        other signaling implementations.  Some devices use a single single DCC extended
        accessory decoder control message to influence _all_ of the heads on the
        mast.  That difference in hardware implementation and messaging usage
        means that configuring a JMRI Signal Mast using other hardware types will
        be different than configuring a JMRI Signal Mast for the SE74-controlled
        signal heads when the SE74 is configured for "Aspect"-mode signaling.

        <h3 id="se8csig">Signaling when the SE74 is in "SE8C-compatible" signaling mode</h3>
        <p>One of the SE74 signal control modes relies upon DCC Accessory Decoder (in other words.
        "Turnout") control mechanisms.  The SE74 Instruction Sheet refers to this mode of
        operation in several different ways:  "4 Turnout" mode, "SE8C Compatible" mode
        and "SW control" mode.  For the purposes of this documentation, the use
        "SE8C" mode shall be used.

        <p>As is implied by one of those names used in the Instruction Sheet, this
        SE74 mode uses the same LocoNet messaging and mechanisms to control the
        signal head behavior.

        <p>When operating in "SE8C" signaling mode, the SE74 may be used JMRI when
        using any DCC system which supports control of turnouts from JMRI.


        <h3 id="whichsigmode">Which SE74 mode should I choose?</h3>
        There are a few considerations when choosing an SE74 signal head control mode:
        <ul>
            <li>Does your DCC system support DCC Extended Accessory Decoder
                control messages <em>or</em> LocoNet?
            <br>
            If your DCC system supports neither, then SE8C mode is the only option.
            <br>If your DCC system supports either or both, then either mode may be used.
            </li>
            <li>Do you already use SE8C-based signaling on your layout?
                <br>If so, then it may make sense to continue to use SE8C mode, for
                the sake of consistency.
            </li>
            <li>Will your signals display any "flashing" aspects?
                <br>When using SE8C mode, any head displaying a flashing aspect
                requires a control message <em>every</em> time the head aspect
                changes.  This message traffic can become problematic in some
                situations.
                <br>
                However, when using SE74 "Aspect" mode signaling,
                only one message is needed to enable the flashing aspect for a
                signal head, and the head will remain flashing until some other
                aspect control message is directed to that head.  This can
                significantly reduce the signaling-related message traffic and can
                reduce or avoid the problematic issues which may be seen with
                flashing aspects and "SE8C" mode signaling.
            <li>If you want/need control over the AUX outputs on the S1 thru S4
                cables, you (apparently) must use Aspect mode, as there appears
                to be no way to control the AUX outputs in "SE8C Compatible" mode.
                JMRI does not have any reasonable way to control the AUX output
                (i.e. what SE74 documentation calls the "Lunar" aspect) when
                SE74 OpSw41 is "C"losed.
            </li>
            <li>Because SE8C-mode signaling is controlled via "Turnout" operations,
                it is necessary to program the SE8C so that its signal control
                addresses do not "conflict" with any other turnout-controlled
                device on the layout.  SE74 "Aspect" mode signaling can only
                conflict with those devices which use the "Extended Accessory
                Decoder" messaging (or its LocoNet equivalent), thus making it <em>
                    far</em> easier to void addressing conflicts.</li>
            <li>Control of a "Lunar" aspect is not available when the SE74 operates
            in "SE8C" signaling mode.  When the SE74 operates in "Aspect" signaling
            mode, a "Lunar" aspect may be displayed.  Depending on the SE74 OpSw
            settings, the "Lunar" aspect may be displayed in addition to another
            aspect (Red/Yellow/Green/Flashing Red/Flashing Yellow/Flashing Green),
            or instead of that other aspect.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the author's <em>opinion</em>, "Aspect" mode is preferred over "SE8C
            Compatible mode" for any system which can support "Aspect" mode.

        <h3 id="configAspectSignaljmri">Configuring SE74 "Aspect"-mode "Signal Head" objects in JMRI</h3>

        <p>This section describes how to associate a JMRI "Signal Head" object with the
        SE74 hardware and one of its controlled Signal Heads, when the SE74 is
        configured to use "Aspect"-mode signaling.  This section does not apply
        when the SE74 is configured for "SE8C"-mode signaling; see <a href="#configSe8cSignalingjmri">
        this section</a> for information on configuring JMRI Signal Head objects
        when using the SE74 in "SE8C"-mode.

        <p>It is assumed that you have JMRI configured to communicate with your
        DCC system, and that you have configured the SE74 for "Aspect" mode signaling
        and that the SE74 has a base address which does not conflict with any other
        aspect-mode signaling hardware.  With those assumptions met, you may
        start configuring the JMRI "Signal Head" objects.

        <p>Within the JMRI Panel Pro application, open the Signal Heads" table
            (i.e. <strong>Tools&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;Tables&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;Signal&nbsp;Heads</strong>
            ).  This table shows all of the
        Signal Heads which have been defined.

        <p>To configure a new JMRI "Signal Head" object, it is necessary to "add"
        a signal head.  This is done by activating the "Add" button at the bottom
        of the Signal Heads table.  This will open an "Add Signal Head" window,
        where the specific information required to define a signal head may be
        entered.  An example image is shown below.
        <br>
        <img src="images/Se74AspectModeSignalAHead.png" alt="Example of the add signal head window when adding a DCC controlled Signal Head">

        <ul>
            <li>For use with SE74-controlled signal heads when the SE74 is configured
        for "Aspect"-mode signaling, the "DCC Signal Decoder" control method
        is appropriate.  Select this control mode at the top of the window.
        When the signal head control mode is changed to "DCC Signal
        Decoder", the window will be re-drawn to show only the signal head
        configuration information which applies to this method of controlling the
        signal head.</li>

            <li>Select the appropriate "connection" type.  Choose the JMRI "connection"
            name which reflects the connection from which the SE74 will get its
            control information.  When using the SE74 with a Digitrax-based layout, the
            connection name will typically be "LocoNet".
            </li>
            <li>Enter the "Hardware Address".  This is the address by which JMRI
            communicates with the individual signal head.  When the SE74 is used in
            "Aspect" signaling mode with a LocoNet-based command station, the hardware
            address can be related to the SE74 "base address" using the following
            equation:
            <br>
            <code>Aspect Mode Hardware Address = (SE74 base address) + ((SE74 head number) - 1)</code>
            </li>
            <li>The "Address offset" checkbox can be used to configure JMRI to adjust
            the hardware address value for use on DCC systems which use a different
            interpretation of the NMRA "DCC Extended Accessory Decoder" message specification.
            This offset is unneeded when used with Digitrax DCC systems, and should
            remain unchecked in those cases.</li>
            <li>The "Send Count" setting allows for the DCC system to repeatedly send an
            aspect change message multiple times.  For LocoNet-connected SE74s, this
            parameter may be reduced to its lowest value.</li>
            <li>In the "Add Signal Head" window, enter a "User name" for the signal head.
            It is common to specify a user name which gives the "location" of the
            signal mast upon which the head will be used, as well as which head it
            represents on the mast.  It may also be useful to give specific information about
            how the Signal Head will be used on the layout.  Some User Name examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>"West Duluth Westward Main A Head", or, more compactly "W.D. WWD M A"</li>
            <li>"Rangeley River Jct. Main 2 Eastward B Head", or, more-compactly, "RRJct M2 EWD B"</li>
            <li>"Alleghany Eastward Siding Westward A Head", or, more-compactly, "Al. EWD Siding WWD A"</li>
            <li>"132A", for the "A" (top) head on mast 132</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>The JMRI "default" values for the aspect numbers are consistent with SE74
        aspect numbering and should not be modified.</li>
        <li>Once you have updated all of the settings to reflect your needs for that head,
        activate the "Create" button.</li>
        <li>An additional head may be created by updating only those fields in the "Add
        New Signal Head" window which differ from the displayed data.  Typically this
        means the "User Name" and "Hardware Address" fields will need to be changed.
        Activate the "Create" button to add a new signal head using the modified
        information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that there is no JMRI requirement to select a user name that mentions the
        Digitrax "head letter", except that it will be easiest to wire and debug
        if you leave yourself sufficient hints.  Those hints may be left in the
        user name, in the "comments", or may be left out of the JMRI information
        altogether at the user's choice.  If you are able to compute the connector
        number and Digitrax "head" letter from the "head" address and the SE74
        base address, you may not need such hints.

        <p>Note also that the SE74's "aspect-mode" signaling provides a SE74 setting
        where the "Lunar" aspect may be made "persistant".  JMRI is not able to
        understand the concept of a "persistant" aspect capability, so that feature
        needs to be disabled in the SE74's OpSw settings.

        <h3 id="configSe8cSignaljmri">Configuring SE74 "SE8C"-mode "Signal Head" objects in JMRI</h3>
        <p>It is assumed that you have JMRI configured to communicate with your DCC

            and that the SE74 has a base address which does not conflict with any of
            your other hardware.  With those assumptions met, you may start

            <p>Extending the example above, a three-head mast would require two
            additional head definitions.  If the additional heads are to be configured
            to be the next two heads on a SE8C-mode SE74, they would be defined as
            shown in the images below.

        <img src="images/Se74CompatabilityModeSignalCHead.png" alt="Example of configuring

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once you have defined your signal head(s), and you have your signaling hardware
        connected, you should verify that the JMRI Signal Heads actually control
        the signal hardware appropriately.  You may check this by verifying that the
        physical signal head is actually displaying the aspect which is shown for that
        signal head in the Signal Heads table's "Appearance" column.

        <p>Note that JMRI supports displaying "flashing" aspects on SE8C-mode signal
        heads, but it <em>does not</em> support the SE8C's "Flashing Aspect" feature, and
        therefore does not support the SE74's equivalent feature.  Be sure that the
        SE74's "fourth aspect" setting specifies "Dark" as the fourth aspect.This
        limitation was intentionally chosen by JMRI designers because the SE8C
        "flashing aspect" feature would only be able to support one flashing color.
        That limitation is inconsistent with many prototypical signaling systems.
        Instead, JMRI developers chose to make use of "dark" for the "fourth aspect"
        as the fourth aspect, as JMRI could then control the head's
        turnouts in appropriate patterns in order to achieve "flashing" aspects for
        any of the head's colors.

        <h3 id="configSigMastjmri">Configuring SE74 Signal Heads on Signal Masts in JMRI</h3>

        <p>Once you have configured one  or more JMRI "Signal Head"s defined, you may
        then create one or more JMRI "Signal Mast"s which use those configured heads.
        Configuring JMRI Signal Mast objects is necessary for several forms of
        JMRI-controlled signaling, especially for JMRI "Signal Mast Logic"-based
        signaling.

        <p>Creating a JMRI Signal Mast object using one or more JMRI Signal Head objects
        allows JMRI to hide any differences in Signal Head implementations at the Signal
        Head level.  That means that defining the Signal Mast is <em>independent</em>
        of the SE74's signaling mode setting - if you have configured the JMRI
        Signal Heads in a way which matches the SE74 signaling mode, then the JMRI
        Signal Mast simply uses the Signal Heads, and "gets it right" automatically.

        <p>The image below shows how to configure a JMRI Signal
        Mast when the mast is controlled via JMRI "signal head" objects.

        <p>The mast being defined is a three-head Searchlight mast using the AAR-1946
        "signal system", and will be used at "East Edsel".  The specified "User
        Name" was chosen to describe the location of the mast, and is chosen to
        included the word "Mast" to help differentiate the Signal Mast's User
        Name from the User Names used for the Signal Heads.  If there were any other
        masts at East Edsel which governed movement in the opposite direction, then
        it would be appropriate to include some sort of "direction" in the user name,
        such as "E. Edsel WWD Mast", where "WWD" is an abbreviation for "WestWarD".

        <p>The mast is comprised of the three signal heads - the three "SE8C-mode"
        SE74 signal heads defined above in the section on defining SE8C-mode SE74
        signal heads.  Note that if the mast were comprised instead of three "aspect-
        mode" SE74 signal heads, the mast definition would <em>not be any different</em>
        - it would simply use the appropriate signal head "user name"s.

        <p>Also note that two "aspects" have been disabled - aspects associated with
        "Limited Speed" indications, because in this example, the trackwork at
        East Edsel does not have any route which supports the "Limited" speed, so
        those aspects are not allowed to be displayed by this mast.
        <br>
        <img src="images/SignalMastExample.png" alt="A Signal Mast Example showing
             a Signal Head Controlled Mast">

        <p>To create such a mast, the following steps are necessary:

        <ul>
            <li>Create the appropriate signal heads before creating the signal mast.</li>
            <li>Open the Signal Masts Table - via <strong>Tools&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;Tables&nbsp;
                &rArr;&nbsp;Signal&nbsp;Masts</strong>.</li>
            <li>Activate the "Add..." button (at the bottom of the Signal Masts table window).</li>
            <li>Enter an appropriate, meaningful User Name, such as "E. Edsel Mast"</li>
            <li>Select the signaling system.  In this case, the railroad uses "AAR-1946" signaling.</li>
            <li>Select the appropriate mast type.  In this case, the mast is a
                "triple searchlight high signal" mast.</li>
            <li>Specify the "Mast Driver" as "Signal Head Controlled Mast".  This indicates
                that the mast will control the connected hardware via the defined signal
                heads.</li>
            <li>Specify if the mast will be allowed to be "unlit" (i.e. "Dark") via the
                "This mast can be unlit" checkbox.  Allowing a mast to be "unlit"
                is useful when implementing "approach lighting".
                <br>
                Since the example head is a 3-head signal, and in US-prototype signaling,
                the 3-head signal mast is typically used as a "home" signal at an
                "interlocking", and since most US-prototype railroads keep their
                "home" signals lit constantly, the example leaves the checkbox
                un-checked.
            <li>Specify the applicable "Signal Heads".  Note that the top-most entry
                corresponds to the head at the top of the mast.  The next-lower entry
                corresponds to the next-lower head on the mast, etc., as appropriate
                for the mast type.</li>
            <li>You may place a check-mark in the box labeled "Include previously used
                Signal Heads" in order to include, in the "drop-down" signal head lists,
                those signal heads which have already been assigned to a JMRI signal mast.
                Since it is very rare that any one JMRI signal head's indication can be used
                on more than one signal mast, it is generally best to leave this box
                un-checked.</li>
            <li>In the "Disable Specific Aspects" section, you may prevent the signaling
                logic from displaying one or more of the mast's possible aspects by
                placing a check-mark next to the aspect(s) to be disabled.  In this
                example, the "Limited"-type aspects are not appropriate, so they have
                been "check-mark"ed.</li>
            <li>When satisfied with the signal mast configuration, activate the "Create"
                button at the bottom of the "Add/Edit Signal Mast" window.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the example, the mast will always be "lit", because the "This mast
        may be Unlit" feature has not been enabled (has not been "check-marked").
        This choice makes sense for the type of signaling which is being implementing
        for this mast.  Other masts might make us of the
        "Unlit" feature, perhaps for so-called "approach lighting".

        <p>Once the JMRI Signal Mast has been configured, any change to the signal
        mast's "Appearance" will cause the associated JMRI Signal Head object(s)
        to be changed to the individual head aspect(s) to match the mast's definition
        for that aspect.  Any such Signal Head aspect change(s) will be propagated,
        under the JMRI "Signal Head" object's direction, to the appropriate signaling
        hardware (in this case, the SE74), so that the the hardware may update
        its outputs based on the control information which has been conveyed to it.
        <p>This means that you can test the JMRI configuration of your SE74 hardware
            using the following techniques.  (They also apply to other signaling
            configurations, too!)
            <ul>
                <li>You may test JMRI's ability to update the appropriate JMRI
                    Signal Head object(s) by changing the "Appearance" value for
                    the JMRI Signal Mast object in the JMRI Signal Masts table.
                    Change the "appearance" of the signal mast object, then check
                    the Signal Heads table to see that the appropriate head(s)
                    have been changed to the appropriate aspect(s).</li>
                <li>Once you know that the JMRI Signal Head objects are properly
                    controlled by the JMRI Signal Mast "Appearance" setting, you can
                    then check that the JMRI Signal Mast "Appearance" setting has
                    the appropriate affect on the SE74-controlled signal.  Change
                    the mast's "appearance" value and then check that the physical signal
                    changes to the appropriate "aspect".</li>
            </ul>

        An example of this is shown in the image below.  The "E. Edsel Mast" was
        placed on a Layout Editor panel and associated with the "Anchor Point"
        located where two different blocks met, and the icon placed "to the right
        side" of the track line, as viewed from the cab of an approaching train.
        When the "Appearance" setting in the "Signal Masts" table for the "E. Edison
        Mast" was changed to "Advance Approach Medium", this caused JMRI to:

        <ol>
            <li>Update the icon on the panel to show the appropriate mast aspect:
                Green over Yellow over Red.</li>
            <li>Propagate the appropriate "appearance" values to each of the Signal
                Head objects associated with the mast:
                <ul>
                    <li>"E. Edsel A" head to "Green"</li>
                    <li>"E. Edsel B" head to "Yellow"</li>
                    <li>"E. Edsel C" head to "Red"</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Propagate the changes to the signal head Appearance values to the
                hardware, using the mechanisms appropriate for each head and as
                defined by the JMRI "Signal Head" definition.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="images/Se74MastOnPanel.png" alt="Image showing a JMRI Layout Editor panel
             with some track, a level crossing, and a three-head signal mast
             protecting leftward movement over the level crossing.">
        <br>
        <p>Note that any change to the "Appearance" value for an individual Signal
        Head object will propagate to the appropriate hardware, but a change of a
        JMRI Signal Head object's Appearance will not propagate to a JMRI "Signal
        Mast" object.  This is a characteristic of the implementation of the
        "Signal Head Controlled Mast" type of JMRI Signal Mast.

      <h2 id="turnouts">Controlling SE74 "turnout" outputs</h2>
      <p>JMRI may control the SE74's "turnout" outputs just like it controls any
      other Turnout - via a JMRI "Turnout" object.  In general, JMRI Turnout objects are defined
      in the JMRI "Turnouts" table, and are discussed elsewhere.

      <p>JMRI's LocoNet mechanisms provide a mechanism where JMRI can "discover"
          LocoNet-connected turnouts.  That mechanism is able to discover
          SE74-related turnout objects, and will do so when the SE74 is powered and is
          connected to LocoNet when JMRI starts up with a live connection to that
          LocoNet.

      <h2 id="inputs">SE74 inputs</h2>
      <p>While the SE74's inputs may be used with JMRI, the behaviors of the SE74s
          inputs, at least for SE74 firmware versions available to the date of
          this writing, are "odd".  In general, the SE74 input pin behaviors do not
          match the behaviors of any previous Digitrax product.  The SE74 "SWx" input pins
          "sort-of" behave like the similarly-named DS64 input pins do when the DS64 is in
          configured one way.  The "SENSx" pins "sort-of" behave like the "AUXx"
          DS64 input pins do for other DS64 configurations.
      <p>With SE74 firmware implementations available in early 2023, the "default"
          values of SE74 OpSws 11 and 30 result in the SENSx input pins generating
          LocoNet messaging which is suitable for "general-purpose" sensor input.
          Those inputs will be reflected as four JMRI "Sensor" objects, with sensor
          hardware addresses of:
      <table border="2">
          <tr>
              <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensor&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

          </tr>
          <tr>

        </table>

      <h2 id="routes">SE74 Routes</h2>
      <p>The SE74 provides "route" functionality, where each of 8 routes may be
          configured with a "trigger" switch control, and up to 7 additional switch
          control messages to send when that trigger switch control is seen as a
          message on LocoNet.  JMRI does not have a tool for configuring the SE74's
          "routes" functionality at this time.  Instead, use the mechanisms described
          in the SE74 manual.
          <p>JMRI may <em>trigger</em> an SE74 route by sending a LocoNet switch
              control message which matches the "trigger" entry for any one of
              the routes configured in the SE74.
