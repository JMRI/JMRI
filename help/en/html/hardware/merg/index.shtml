                <div>
                    <p>MERG (Model Electronic Railway Group) hardware supported by JMRI is currently
                        centred around the range of CBUS&reg; kits designed by and for members of MERG.</p>
                    <p>This page is aimed at helping users of MERG hardware and JMRI to setup their system.</p>
                    <p>For an overview of CBUS see the separate <a href="../can/cbus/index.shtml"> CBUS
                        help topic</a>.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Typical first-time Connection Steps</h3>
                    <p>Launch JMRI and create a new system connection for MERG as the System Manufacturer.</p>
                    <p>JMRI's general approach is to support as many hardware combinations as possible. 
                        By supporting as many people and their hardware desires as possible, we can create
                        a growing community of developers, hence more code. As part of this, the JMRI CAN 
                        support is designed to use as many CAN adapter types as possible. 
                        Not many PCs have a RS232 serial port now, however is still supported.</p>
                    <p>Choose the <a href="Details.shtml"> System connection </a> appropriate to your hardware.
                    <p>Save / Restart JMRI</p>
                    <p>If you are using DCC over the MERG connection, check that JMRI Preferences > Defaults 
                        are set correctly, see <a href="#dcc">DCC over CBUS</a>.</p>
                    <p>A new menu item MERG appears in the PanelPro or DecoderPro window, containing the MERG tools.
                        <br>Help > Window Help will show relevant info in the tools and any JMRI window.</p>
                    <p>Test events can be sent from the
                        <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/swing/send/CanSendFrame.shtml">Send CAN Frame tool</a>.  
                        <br>
                        Set the test event, eg Frame packets "+1" and / or "-2" (without the quotation marks), 
                        waiting 500 msec and click Start Sending to generate steady CBUS network traffic.
                        <br>
                        Check that these events are actually being sent over the CBUS network by using a module such as a CANACT.</p>
                    <p>Use an external producer module to test connectivity receiving events, confirming they appear in the 
                        <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/swing/console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml">CBUS console</a>.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="../../../package/apps/SystemConsole.shtml">JMRI System Console</a>
                        is a good tool for diagnosing issues during setup and operation. </p>

                <h2><a name="dcc" id="dcc">DCC over CBUS with MERG hardware</a></h2>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/connection/merg-jmri-cbus-preferences-defaults-500x215.png"
                         width="500" height="215" alt="JMRI MERG CONNECTION DCC DEFAULT PREFERENCES" align=
                         "right">
                    <p>You do not need to have a DCC layout to use MERG hardware with JMRI. Many DC layouts use 
                        MERG hardware for route setting, signalling and track occupancy purposes.</p>
                    <p>If you are using DCC, JMRI will send and receive the DCC packets over the CBUS network
                        and can be monitored within the CBUS console</p>
                    <p>Loco sessions are best viewed with the 
                        <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/swing/cbusslotmonitor/CbusSlotMonitorPane.shtml"> 
                           CBUS Command Station Monitor</a>, which displays the sessions in a table format.</p>
                    <p>There are also a number of DC Command Stations which have been designed by MERG members
                        which use the standard CBUS protocol for requesting and controlling loco sessions.</p>

                    <h3>Throttles</h3>
                    <p>All of the programs within the JMRI suite (including the JMRI WiThrottle server)
                        internally share the same command station slot for a given loco address,
                        so all of JMRI appears to the command station as a single CANCAB for any single address.</p>

                    <p>JMRI (via the CBUS Node Manager) can tell if a command station is available which 
                        supports the CBUS steal or share feature (eg. supported with CANCMD v4 +).</p>

                    <p>The Steal / Share features are for when throttles are requested which are already in use 
                        by something external to JMRI.</p>

                    <p>When a JMRI application requests a loco (which is already in a CBUS session), 
                        JMRI will check the main <a 
                            href="../../tools/throttle/ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">Throttles Preferences</a>.</p>

                    <p>If Silent Steal or Silent Share has been selected, this will be the default action.</p>

                    <p>If neither have been checked and you are using the main JMRI Throttle, you will be asked
                        if you want to Steal, Share, or cancel.</p>

                    <img src="images/web/cbus-throttle-steal-share-dialogue-322x128.png"
                         width="322" height="128" alt="JMRI CBUS Steal Share Dialogue">

                    <p>If you are using an automation script and neither option is checked, the system will
                        attempt to acquire a Share on the session.</p>

                    <p>The command station may disable or enable steal / share at any point, 
                        so even if you have a preferred option, an automation script may attempt to use
                        the non-preferred option to obtain the session.</p>

                    <h4>Throttles Stolen from JMRI</h4>

                    <p>When a Throttle session has been stolen / cancelled from outside of JMRI, 
                        any open JMRI throttle window for that loco
                        will cease to accept commands, ie throttle slider and function keys greyed out.</p>

                    <p>If Silent Share is enabled in the Throttle Preferences, 
                        and share is available on the Command Station,
                        after a short delay JMRI will attempt to share the throttle.</p>

                    <p>For most users, silent sharing enables most layouts to operate with minimum of fuss.</p>

                    <p>If Silent Steal is enabled in the Throttle Preferences, 
                        and steal is available on the Command Station,
                        after a short delay JMRI will attempt to steal the throttle back.</p>

                    <p>Beware of creating Steal loops if more than 1 CAB is capable of auto-stealback!
                        If you find this is happening, disable the Silent Stealing option to stop the loop.</p>

                    <p>If neither option is enabled, or the steal / share is not possible, a notification will be displayed:</p>

                    <img src="images/web/cbus-throttle-stolen-dialogue-278x138.png"
                         width="278" height="138" alt="JMRI CBUS Stolen Throttle Dialogue">

                    <p>Ticking the checkbox before closing the popup will supress loco steal notifications for
                        the rest of the JMRI session, for all loco sessions.</p>

                    <p>Relevant information can be viewed in the main JMRI Console log.</p>

                    <p>Note that not all JMRI applications currently have a method for dealing with a stolen throttle.</p>

                    <h4>Dispatch / Release</h4>
                    <p>Dispatch is available according to Command Station Firmware (eg. supported with CANCMD v4 +)</p>
                    <p>Note that as dispatch availability for a single loco address may change, 
                        this will be reflected by button availability in the main JMRI Throttle.</p>

                    <h3>Consisting</h3>
                    <p>The MERG system allows for advanced consisting to be set using CANCMD and CANCABs.</p>

                    <p>Although the CBUS protocol and CANCMD support Advanced Consisting, 
                        this has not been implemented within JMRI at present.</p>

                    <p><a href="../../../html/tools/consisttool/ConsistTool.shtml" 
                          title="JMRI Consisting">JMRI Consisting</a> 
                        : Advanced Decoder Consisting (Decoder Assisted Consist) is currently unsupported,
                        hence this is set to Internal in the CBUS preferences.</p>

                    <p>Primary Address Consists are supported however.</p>

                    <h3>Connecting a MERG DCC Command Station (CANCMD , CANCSB etc.)</h3>

                    <p>On JMRI startup, the CBUS Node Manager can search for command stations.</p>
                    <p>If a command station responds then it will be added to the node table. </p>

                    <p>A command station found at startup will also enable the Track Current Meter, 
                        available from the main PanelPro > Tools > Track Current Meter.
                        <br>This listens for extended event 1 from whichever node number command station 0 is set for.</p>
                    <p>The frequency and other settings for this are within the command station node variables.</p>

                    <p>Make sure that main <a href="../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Defaults"
                                              >JMRI Preferences Defaults</a> are set to your MERG connection for 
                        Throttles, Power Control, Command Station, Service Programmer and Ops Mode Programmer.</p>

                    <p>You can use an existing DCC command station, 
                        or have a separate DCC command station for a programming track 
                        (eg. a <a href="../../../html/hardware/sprog/SPROG.shtml">SPROG</a>) by setting these options.</p>

                    <p>Events do not need to be set up to connect a MERG DCC Command Station CANCMD.</p>

                    <p>DCC Accessory Decoders can be controlled over CBUS and a CANCMD 
                        by creating turnouts with explicit RDCCx Opscode commands, 
                        see <a href="../../../html/hardware/can/cbus/Names.shtml#hex">CBUS hex event naming</a>.
                        <br>
                        This is also discussed within the <a href="#thirdparty">CBUS WIKI</a> documentation.</p>
