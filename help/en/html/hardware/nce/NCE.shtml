  <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

  <h3>Command Station</h3>

  <p>JMRI supports three NCE layout connections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Power Pro (PowerHouse) via serial cable</li>

    <li>Power Pro (PowerHouse) via network connection</li>

    <li>NCE USB Interface via a USB cable</li>
  </ul>They are shown in the JMRI Preferences Connection pane as
  NCE, NCE via network, and NCE USB Interface,
  respectively.<a name="limitations" id="limitations"></a>

  <h2>Limitations</h2>

  <p>A very small number of early (pre-2002) NCE Power Pro
  (PowerHouse) command stations have an "optional analog control
  circuit". (If you don't recall special ordering this, you
  probably don't need to read the rest of this paragraph!) In
  these, pins 5, 6, and 9 are used with an analog voltage as a
  separate throttle. If you have one of these command stations, a
  normal 9-pin serial cable will not work! You'll need to make a
  custom cable that just connects the "send data", "receive data"
  and "ground" pins. See your NCE manual for details.</p><a name=
  "connecting" id="connecting"></a>

  <h2>Connecting</h2>

  <h3>Settings</h3><a name="AIU" id="AIU"></a> <a name="names" id=
  "names"></a>

  <h4>AIU (Input) Numbering</h4>
  The NCE "AIU" device allows the NCE
  command station to check the status of inputs from the layout.
  These are referenced in JMRI as "Sensors" with names like
  "NS785". "NS" means "NCE Sensor", and 785 is the number of a
  specific sensor input.

  <p>The sensor number can be found by using the following
  formula:</p>

  <p>Sensor ID = (AIU Cab Address - 1) * 16 + (Pin Number On AIU)
  -1</p>

  <p>For example: The AIU cab address is set to 50 and one of the
  BD20s is connected to pin 2. Therefore the Sensor ID would
  be:</p>

  <p>Sensor ID = (50 - 1) * 16 + (2) -1</p>

  <p>Sensor ID = 785</p>

  <p>In the hardware address field of the Add Sensor window you can
  enter in the AIU cab address followed by the pin number separated
  by a semicolon. So for a sensor on AIU cab address 50, pin 2 you
  would enter the following: <b>50:2</b></p>

  <h4>Turnout Numbering</h4>
  JMRI can access accessory decoders as
  NCE Turnouts and Lights. They are addressed using the same
  numbers that you would use on your NCE throttle to throw the
  accessory decoder. For example, if you can access turnout 21 from
  your throttle, JMRI would address it as "NT21" or just "21".

  <h4>Adding an item to the table</h4>
  <p>When you add an item to one of the tables, many times you only
    have to fill in the numbers to have JMRI construct
    the complete system name.<br>
    Here's a summary, split up for
    outputs (eg. Turnouts) and inputs (eg. Sensors):</p>

  <a id="eeprom" name="eeprom"></a>
  <h4>EPROM Versions</h4>

  <p>The NCE Power Pro command station uses an "EPROM" to contain
  it's software. NCE has made several of these available to it's
  users. JMRI has been updated to work with these as they come out.
  To determine which ROM version you have, go to the 'setup command
  station' menu on the ProCab. The first screen will show you the
  EPROM version currently installed.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>December 2004 EPROM - JMRI 1.6.1 or any JMRI 1.7 version or
    later should work fine.</li>

    <li>2007 EPROM - you need JMRI 1.7.6 or later.</li>

    <li>Various "beta test" versions from early 2006 - ask NCE to
    send you an update to the 2007 EPROM, then use JMRI 1.7.6 or
    later</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you wish to use MONITORING for Turnout feedback, you must
  upgrade your Command Station to the Mar 1 2007A EPROM or newer.
  (For more information on turnout feedback, please see the
  <a href="../../doc/Technical/TurnoutFeedback.shtml">feedback
  documentation page</a>) The release in the first half of 2007 had
  a problem with odd turnout status. Every other odd accessory
  shared the same status bit. JMRI checks the revision number at
  startup, and will send a warning to the console window if it
  finds the early 2007 EPROM. If you're not sure if you have the
  latest, you can perform a simple test. First normal accessory 1
  and 5 using the "Select Accy" button on your ProCab. Then using
  the "Select Accy" button, change accessory 1 to REV. Then check
  accessory 5, and if NOW = REV for accessory 5, you have the
  earlier revision with the known problem. If you have the early
  2007 EPROM and wish to use MONITORING for feedback, contact NCE
  for an EPROM upgrade.</p>

  <h4>Power Pro (PowerHouse) via serial cable</h4><img src=
  "../images/NcePowerPro.gif" width="168" height="66" align="right"
  alt="NCE Power Pro">

  <p>This section discusses JMRI's support for connecting to the
  NCE Power Pro and PowerHouse via the serial cable connector on
  their front panel.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>To connect your computer to an NCE Power Pro or PowerHouse
    system, you can usually just connect the command station to the
    computer's serial port using a 9-pin serial cable. This cable
    must be a 'straight through' extension cable and not a 'modem'
    type cable. On newer computers there might not be a serial
    port, so you will need to use one of the computers USB ports
    and a USB to serial adapter. See <a href=
    "../USBtoSerial.shtml">Via a USB to Serial adapter</a> for more
    information.<br>
    Many USB-Serial devices will still need a serial extension
    cable to connect the command station to the USB-Serial
    adapter.<br>
    Note that this is <em>not</em> the same thing as the <a href=
    "#powercab">NCE USB Interface</a>, which is mostly for <a href=
    "#usblimitations">use with the PowerCab</a>, not the Power Pro
    or Powerhouse system.</li>

    <li>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.
    This opens automatically the first time a program is run, or
    you can select it from the "Edit" menu.</li>

    <li>Select "NCE" from the top selection box. You can then
    select the proper serial port in the second selection box.</li>

    <li>If given the option to select a baud rate choose 9,600
    which is the default for NCE.</li>

    <li>Now confirm that the AIU broadcasts are disabled and the
    baud rate set in the NCE command station is the same as JMRI.
    These are the normal defaults for NCE. Use a ProCab to select
    "SET CMD STATION" by pressing the PROG/ESC button 5 times. Then
    press the ENTER button 14 times to determine if AIU broadcasts
    are disabled. Press 0 to disable. Now press the ENTER button
    once more to select the baud rate. Press 1 to set the baud rate
    to 9,600, and press PROG/ESC to exit.</li>

    <li>Select the version of EPROM present in your command
    station, either "2004 or earlier" or "2006 or later". See
    <a href="#eeprom">below</a> for more information on this.</li>

    <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
    quit, click "Yes".</li>

    <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>

    <li>If not see the <a href="#troubleShoot">Troubleshooting</a>
    section below.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>For reliable operation, we recommend that you disable "AIU
  broadcast", and set the baud rate to 9,600. These are the normal
  defaults for NCE. Both of these parameters can be found in your
  NCE user's manual under "Setup Command Station".</p><a name=
  "vianetwork" id="vianetwork"></a>

  <h3>Power Pro (PowerHouse) via Network</h3>Instead of connecting
  a serial cable from your computer to a Power Pro, you can also
  connect JMRI to your Power Pro via a network connection and a
  serial-network adapter. This will let you, for example, connect a
  computer in one room to a layout in another without having to run
  a long serial cable.

  <p>(There's also a <a href="../TerminalServer.shtml">general
  page</a> on the use of serial-network adapters, also known as
  terminal servers)</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Connect your serial-network adapter to your NCE Power Pro
    or PowerHouse system using a 9-pin serial cable.</li>

    <li>Configure the serial-network adapter to use the same baud
    rate set as the NCE command station. 9600 baud is the normal
    default for NCE. To confirm this and the AIU broadcast setting,
    use a ProCab to select "SET CMD STATION" by pressing the
    PROG/ESC button 5 times. Then press the ENTER button 14 times
    to determine if AIU broadcasts are disabled. Press 0 to
    disable. Now press the ENTER button once more to select the
    baud rate. Press 1 to set the baud rate to 9,600, and press
    PROG/ESC to exit.</li>

    <li>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.
    This opens automatically the first time a program is run, or
    you can select it from the "Edit" menu.</li>

    <li>Select "NCE via network" from the top selection box.</li>

    <li>In the "Server hostname" box, enter the Internet name or
    Internet address numbers for your serial-network adapter. In
    the "Port number" box, enter the port on the serial-network
    adapter to be used.</li>

    <li>Select the version of EPROM present in your command
    station, either "2004 or earlier" or "2006 or later". See
    <a href="#eeprom">above</a> for more information on this.</li>

    <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
    quit, click "Yes".</li>

    <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>

    <li>If not see the <a href="#troubleShoot">trouble shooting</a>
    section below.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>For reliable operation, we recommend that you disable "AIU
  broadcast", and set the baud rate to 9,600. These are the normal
  defaults for NCE. Both of these parameters can be found in your
  NCE user's manual under "Setup Command Station".</p><a name=

  <h3>NCE USB Interface</h3><img src="../images/nceUSB.jpg" width=
  "85" height="85" align="right" alt="NCE USB Interface">

  <p>The NCE USB Interface can be connected to all NCE systems,
  Power Cab, SB3 (SmartBooster), SB5, Twin or Power Pro. You must
  select the correct system from the preference menu for reliable
  operation.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>On most computers, you'll need to install a driver for the
    <a href=
    "https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx">
      CP201x USB to UART Bridge VCP</a> used in the NCE USB
      Interface.

      <ul>
        <li><a href=
        "http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx">
        Windows driver</a></li>

        <li><a href=
        "https://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip">
        Mac OS X driver</a></li>

        "https://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/cp210x-3.0.0.tar.gz">
        Linux driver</a></li>

        <li>If one of the above links doesn't work, you can perhaps
        find the needed driver on the <a href=
        "https://www.silabs.com/products/interface/usbtouart/Pages/default.aspx">
        support web site</a> for <a href=
        "http://www.silabs.com/Pages/default.aspx">SiLabs</a>
        chips.</li>
      </ul>Download the proper file, unpack it, and execute the
      installer. Be sure to follow the directions: On some
      computers, it matters whether or not the NCE USB Interface is
      connected and powered on when you do the install.
    </li>

    <li>Now go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.
    This opens automatically the first time a program is run, or
    you can select it from the "Edit" menu.</li>

    <li>Select "NCE USB" from the top selection box. You can then
    select the proper serial port in the second selection box.</li>

    <li>If given the option to select a baud rate choose 9,600
    which is the default for NCE.</li>

    <li>Select the type of system that you are connecting the USB
    adapter to, Power Cab, SB3, or Power Pro (PowerHouse). The
    default is Power Cab, no jumpers installed.</li>

    <li>Now confirm that the adapter's baud rate is also set for
    9,600 by removing jumper #1. Installing jumper #1 sets the baud
    rate to 19,200.</li>

    <li>The series of radio buttons labeled "GUI style" allows you
    to select how the program will look. "Metal" is the native Java
    look available on all types. Other choices will vary with your
    computer type. "CDE/Motif", "Windows", and "Mac OS X" look
    native on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X respectively.</li>

    <li>In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default
    programmer format. You can override this each time you open the
    programmer, so this is here just for convenience.</li>

    <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
    quit, click "Yes".</li>

    <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>

    <li>If not see the <a hhref="#troubleShoot">trouble
    shooting</a> section below.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To connect your computer using a NCE USB Interface, you will
  need in addition to the USB Adapter, a USB A to USB B cable to
  connect the Adapter to your computer and a Throttle cable to
  connect the adapter to your NCE system. The Throttle cable may be
  another of the 'coily cords' that came with another hardware
  throttle or the PowerCab system.<br>
  It is important to use a straight through RJ11 cable and not a
  crossover like some phone cables. Look at the end connectors to
  make sure that the colors are in the same order. You can use a
  RJ12 cable with six conductors in place of the RJ11 because it's
  only the four center conductors that are used, but it must also
  be a straight through cable.<br>
  NOTE: If using a PowerCab, you must have firmware version 1.28c
  or later installed on that.<br>
  The connection order is also important:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Plug in the cab-bus side and power up the attached
    PowerCab</li>

    <li>Once the PowerCab is up and working, then plug the USB
    cable into the computer.</li>
  </ul><a name="usblimitations" id="usblimitations"></a>

  <h4>NCE USB Interface Limitations</h4>

  <p>The NCE USB Interface doesn't support all of the current JMRI
  features and functions. Some of the restrictions are based on the
  type of system the USB Adapter is connected to. The USB version
  6.* can't get information from AIUs, so they can't be used to get
  feedback from the layout. The USB 7.* version when connected to a
  system with the 1.65 or higher firmware (PowerCab, SB5, Twin) the
  AIU cards can be used, but with restricted cab numbers as in the
  system manual. The turnout feedback mode MONITORING isn't
  available when using a USB, and the Clock functions found in
  tools are also not available. The USB when connected to a Power
  Pro system doesn't support any type of loco programming, and when
  connected to a SB3 only operation mode (no program track) is
  available for loco programming. Most functions and features that
  are not supported by the NCE USB Interface are disabled or grayed
  out in the JMRI program.</p>
  <!--  <p>The NCE USB Interface when connected to a Power Cab or SB3 can only
address accessories (turnouts) between 1 and 250. There isn't a
limitation when connected to a Power Pro.</p> -->

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

  <p>When the connection to your NCE is okay and your NCE system is
  powered up, after starting PanelPro you should see the following
  JMRI Startup screen:</p>

  <p><img src="../images/jmriMainPageOk.jpg" alt=
  "JMRI PanelPro Main Panel"></p>

  <p>If your are using JMRI v 2.1.2 or newer and the screen looks
  like the above, congratulations; you are up and running. The
  startup screen for DecoderPro is similar to PanelPro's.</p>

  <p>If you have the following control panel with the words "NCE:
  ERROR SERIAL USING COMx" in the right center of the panel:</p>

  <p><img src="../images/jmriMainPageFail.jpg" alt=
  "JMRI PanelPro Main Panel"><br>
  you have a problem that needs your attention. The following is a
  list of potential issues that might help you resolve your
  problem:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Confirm that your NCE Command Station is powered up.</li>

    <li>Check your cables, make sure they are installed
    correctly.</li>

    <li>If there was more than one "Serial Port" to choose from in
    the JMRI preferences menu, try the others.</li>

    <li>Recheck the baud rates selected, make sure both JMRI and
    the NCE Command Station are set to the same rates.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Using the System Console</h3>

  <p>JMRI provides connection information via the system console.
  You can find the system console under the main menu header "Help"
  then "System console...". Below is an image of the console window
  when the program is operating normally. Note that the window size
  has been adjusted so we can read it a bit more easily.</p>

  <p><img src="../images/jmriConsoleOk.jpg" alt="JMRI Console"></p>

  <p>If you're having problems, the console window can look like
  the one below:</p>

  <p><img src="../images/jmriConsoleFail.jpg" alt=
  "JMRI Console"></p>

  <p>To help you better understand what might be happening and to
  possibly resolve your problem we'll explain some of the warning
  and error messages displayed in the above console window.</p>

  <p>The very first messages are information message labeled
  "INFO". The first message occurs at time "0" which can be found
  at the left side of the message. The next "INFO" message states
  where this log file is stored. The next info provides the version
  of JMRI and JAVA that you are using. And the last info message
  provides the communication port that you've selected in
  preferences, along with the baud rate or the speed of your
  connection.</p>

  <p>The first warning message states that there was a timeout to
  message "AA". During startup, JMRI checks to see if your
  Preferences match those in the NCE command station. Message "AA"
  requests the EPROM revision of the command station. The response
  is normally three characters, something like "6.2.1". A timeout
  means that JMRI asked for something and the command station
  didn't respond. When the connection is correct and the system is
  powered up, you should not see any timeout messages.</p>

  <p>The next warning message states that because there was a
  timeout, the program didn't get the information requested from
  the command station. The next messages continue as the program
  tries every 10 seconds to read the EPROM revision by issuing the
  "AA" command. You can try and trouble shoot your connections
  knowing that every 10 seconds JMRI will retest to see if you've
  fixed the problem.</p>

  <p>Whenever JMRI detects a problem with the connection or NCE
  command station, it will request the EPROM revision to see if the
  connection and command station is still operational. So if you
  see timeouts and "AA" commands you have either poor or failed
  connection, or a powered down or failed command station.</p>

  <h3>Using a Loop Back Serial Cable</h3>

  <p>You can confirm that you've selected the correct port and that
  your cable is okay by connecting the male connector pins 2 and 3
  with a small jumper wire. Doing this will loop the message "AA"
  back to JMRI via the Receive line. The console messages should
  change and look like the ones in the following image:</p>

  <p><img src="../images/jmriConsoleLoopback.jpg" alt=
  "JMRI Console Loopback"></p><a name="tools" id="tools"></a>
