<H2>NCE</H2>

<P>JMRI supports three NCE layout connections, Power Pro (PowerHouse) via serial
cable, Power Pro (PowerHouse) via network connection, and NCE USB adapter via serial
cable. They are shown in the preferences menu as NCE, NCE via network,
and NCE USB respectively.</P>

<A ID="phpro"></A>
<H3>Power Pro</H3>
This section discusses JMRI's support for the NCE Power Pro and PowerHouse.

<H4>Setup</H4>

<OL>
	<LI>To connect your computer to an NCE Power Pro or PowerHouse system, you
	can usually just connect the command station to the computer's serial
	port using a 9-pin serial cable.</LI>
	<LI>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program. This
	opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select
	it from the "Edit" menu.</LI>
	<LI>Select "NCE" from the top selection box. You can then select
	the proper serial port in the second selection box.</LI>
	<LI>If given the option to select a baud rate choose 9,600 which
	is the default for NCE.</LI>
	<LI>Now confirm that the AIU broadcasts are disabled and the baud
	rate set in the NCE command station is the same as JMRI. These are the
	normal defaults for NCE. Use a ProCab to select "SET CMD STATION" by
	pressing the PROG/ESC button 5 times. Then press the ENTER button 14
	times to determine if AIU broadcasts are disabled. Press 0 to disable.
	Now press the ENTER button once more to select the baud rate. Press 1
	to set the baud rate to 9,600, and press PROG/ESC to exit.</LI>
	<LI>The series of radio buttons labeled "GUI style" allows you to
	select how the program will look. "Metal" is the native Java look
	available on all types. Other choices will vary with your computer
	type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on
	Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X respectively.</LI>
	<LI>In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default
	programmer format. You can override this each time you open the
	programmer, so this is here just for convenience.</LI>
	<LI>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
	quit, click "Yes".</LI>
	<LI>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</LI>
	<LI>If not see the <A HREF="#troubleShoot">
	trouble shooting </A> section below.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For reliable operation, we recommend that you disable "AIU
broadcast", and set the baud rate to 9,600. These are the normal
defaults for NCE. Both of these parameters can be found in your NCE
user's manual under "Setup Command Station".</P>

<H4>EPROM Versions</H4>

<P>The NCE Power Pro command station uses an "EPROM" to contain
it's software. NCE has made several of these available to it's users.
JMRI has been updated to work with these as they come out. To determine
which ROM version you have, go to the 'setup command station' menu on
the ProCab. The first screen will show you the EPROM version currently
installed.</P>
<UL>
	<LI>December 2004 EPROM - JMRI 1.6.1 or any JMRI 1.7 version or
	later should work fine.</LI>
	<LI>2007 EPROM - you need JMRI 1.7.6 or later.</LI>
	<LI>Various "beta test" versions from early 2006 - ask NCE to send
	you an update to the 2007 EPROM, then use JMRI 1.7.6 or later</LI>
</UL>

<P>If you wish to use MONITORING for turnout feedback, you must
upgrade your command station to the Mar 1 2007A EPROM or newer. The
release in the first half of 2007 had a problem with odd turnout status.
Every other odd accessory shared the same status bit. JMRI checks the
revision number at startup, and will send a warning to the console
window if it finds the early 2007 EPROM. If you're not sure if you have
the latest, you can perform a simple test. First normal accessory 1 and
5 using the "Select Accy" button on your ProCab. Then using the "Select
Accy" button, change accessory 1 to REV. Then check accessory 5, and if
NOW = REV for accessory 5, you have the earlier revision with the known
problem. If you have the early 2007 EPROM and wish to use MONITORING for
feedback, contact NCE for an EPROM upgrade.</P>

<A ID="AIU"></A>
<A ID="names"></A>
<H4>AIU (Input) Numbering</H4>
The NCE "AIU" device allows the NCE command station to check the status
of inputs from the layout. These are referenced in JMRI as "Sensors"
with names like "NS785". "NS" means "NCE Sensor", and 785 is the number
of a specific sensor input.
<P>The sensor number can be found by using the following formula:</P>
<P>Sensor ID = (AIU Cab Address - 1) * 16 + (Pin Number On AIU) -1</P>
<P>For example: The AIU cab address is set to 50 and one of the
BD20s is connected to pin 2. Therefore the Sensor ID would be:</P>
<P>Sensor ID = (50 - 1) * 16 + (2) -1</P>
<P>Sensor ID = 785</P>

<h4>Turnout Numbering</h4>
JMRI can access accessory decoders as NCE Turnouts and Lights.
They are addressed using the same numbers that you would use on your
NCE throttle to throw the accessory decoder.  For example, if you
can access turnout 21 from your throttle, JMRI would address it as 
"NT21" or just "21".

<H4>Limitations</H4>

<P>A very small number of early NCE Power Pro (PowerHouse) command stations
have an "optional analog control circuit". (If you don't recall special
ordering this, you probably don't need to read the rest of this
paragraph!) In these, pins 5, 6, and 9 are used with an analog voltage
as a separate throttle. If you have one of these command stations, a
normal 9-pin serial cable will not work! You'll need to make a custom
cable that just connects the "send data", "receive data" and "ground"
pins. See your NCE manual for details.</P>

<H3>NCE USB Adapter</H3>

<IMG SRC="../images/nceUSB.jpg" WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="85" ALT="NCE USB" >


<P>The NCE USB Adapter can be connected to three NCE systems,
Power Cab, SB3 (SmartBooster) or Power Pro. You must select the correct
system from the preference menu for reliable operation.</P>

<H4>Setup</H4>

<OL>
	<LI>To connect your computer using a NCE USB adaptor, you will
	need in addition to the USB adaptor, a USB cable and a RJ12 to RJ12
	cable.</LI>
	<LI>Now go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program. This
	opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select
	it from the "Edit" menu.</LI>
	<LI>Select "NCE USB" from the top selection box. You can then
	select the proper serial port in the second selection box.</LI>
	<LI>If given the option to select a baud rate choose 9,600 which
	is the default for NCE.</LI>
	<LI>Select the type of system that you are connecting the USB
	adaptor to, Power Cab, SB3, or Power Pro (PowerHouse). The default is Power Cab, no
	jumpers installed.</LI>
	<LI>Now confirm that the adaptor's baud rate is also set for 9,600
	by removing jumper #1. Installing jumper #1 sets the baud rate to
	19,200.</LI>
	<LI>The series of radio buttons labeled "GUI style" allows you to
	select how the program will look. "Metal" is the native Java look
	available on all types. Other choices will vary with your computer
	type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on
	Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X respectively.</LI>
	<LI>In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default
	programmer format. You can override this each time you open the
	programmer, so this is here just for convenience.</LI>
	<LI>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
	quit, click "Yes".</LI>
	<LI>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</LI>

<H4>NCE USB Adapter Limitations</H4>

<P>The NCE USB Adapter doesn't support all of the current JMRI
features and functions. Some of the restrictions are based on the type
of system the USB Adapter is connected to. The USB can't get information
from AIUs, so they can't be used to get feedback from the layout. The
turnout feedback mode MONITORING isn't available when using a USB, and
the Clock functions found in tools are also not available. The USB when
connected to a Power Pro system doesn't support any type of loco
programming, and when connected to a SB3 only operation mode (no program
track) is available for loco programming. Most functions and features
that are not supported by the NCE USB are disabled or grayed out in the
JMRI program.</P>

<P>The USB Adapter when connected to a Power Cab or SB3 can only
address accessories (turnouts) between 1 and 250. There isn't a
limitation when connected to a Power Pro.</P>


<H4>USB Adapter Limitation Summary</H4>

<DL>
	<DT>All systems:</DT>
	<DD>No AIU support, No Turnout MONITORING, No Clock functions.</DD>

	<DT>Power Cab and SB3:</DT>
	<DD>Can only access accessory addresses between 1 and 250.</DD>

	<DT>SB3:</DT>
	<DD>No programming track support, operation mode only.</DD>

	<DT>Power Pro:</DT>
	<DD>No loco programming</DD>

<H3>Trouble Shooting</H3>

When the connection to your NCE is okay and your NCE system is powered
up you should see after starting PanelPro the following control panel:
<P><IMG SRC="../images/jmriMainPageOk.jpg"
	ALT="JMRI PanelPro Main Panel" ></P>
<P>If your are using JMRI 2.1.2 or newer and the panel looks like
the above, congratulations you are up and running. The panel for
DecoderPro is similar to PanelPro's.</P>
<P>If you have the following control panel with the words "ERROR NCE
USING COMx" in the right center of the panel:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/jmriMainPageFail.jpg"
	ALT="JMRI PanelPro Main Panel" ></P>
<P>You have a problem that needs your attention. The following is a
list of potential issues that might help you resolve your problem.</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Confirm that your NCE Command Station is powered up.</LI>
	<LI>Check your cables, make sure they are installed correctly.</LI>
	<LI>If there was more than one "Serial Port" to choose from in the
	JMRI preferences menu, try the others.</LI>
	<LI>Recheck the baud rates selected, make sure both JMRI and the
	NCE Command Station are set to the same rates.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>Console Window</H4>

When JMRI starts, it opens a console window that provides program
status. Below is an image of the console window when the program is
operating normally. Note that the window size has been adjusted so we
can read it a bit more easily. To make your console window look like the
one below, right click the window and select "Properties". Now increase
the Window Size Width to 125. Press OK to exit.
<P><IMG SRC="../images/jmriConsoleOk.jpg" ALT="JMRI Console" ></P>
<P>If you're having problems the console window can look like the
one below:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/jmriConsoleFail.jpg" ALT="JMRI Console" ></P>
<P>To help you better understand what might be happening and to
possibly resolve your problem we'll explain some of the warning and
error messages displayed in the above console window.</P>
<P>The very first message is an information message labeled "INFO"
that states messages above it should be ignored. This message occurs at
time "0" which can be found at the left side of the message. The next
"INFO" message states the version of JMRI and JAVA that you are using.
And the next message is the communication port that you've selected in
preferences, the baud rate, and the status of the communication port
control lines. Don't worry about the control line status, JMRI ignores
them.</P>
<P>The first warning message states that there was a timeout to
message "AA". During startup, JMRI checks to see if your preferences
match those in the NCE command station. Message "AA" requests the EPROM
revision of the command station. The response is normally three
characters, something like "6.2.1". A timeout means that JMRI asked for
something and the command station didn't respond. When the connection is
correct and the system is powered up, you should not see any timeout
messages.</P>
<P>The next warning message states that because there was a timeout,
the program didn't get the information requested from the command
station. The next messages continue as the program tries every 10
seconds to read the EPROM revision by issuing the "AA" command. You can
try and trouble shoot your connections knowing that every 10 seconds
JMRI will retest to see if you've fixed the problem.</P>
<P>Whenever JMRI detects a problem with the connection or NCE
command station, it will request the EPROM revision to see if the
connection and command station is still operational. So if you see
timeouts and "AA" commands you have either poor or failed connection, or
a powered down or failed command station.</P>
<P>If you are still having problems, you should try the <A
	HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/"> JMRI users </A> group.
There you should be able to contact other JMRI users that can help you
out.</P>
