      <h1>Hardware Support: Chubb C/MRI</h1><a name="contents" id="contents"></a>

  <p>This documentation discusses how JMRI may be used with C/MRI, and how
  to get started with connecting a C/MRI system to JMRI. It assumes a basic
  knowledge of JMRI (as documented on this JMRI web site), and some familiarity
  with C/MRI. It is highly recommended that C/MRI users have access to Bruce
  Chubb's <strong>C/MRI User Manual, Version 3.0</strong>, because it contains
  detailed hardware documentation not available elsewhere. Since you don't need
  to write the control software for your computer if you're using JMRI with your
  C/MRI system, you can skip over computer programming details when consulting
  the C/MRI User Manual. Excellent, detailed descriptions for various types of
  signaling systems and model railroad layout device controls are presented in
  Dr. Chubb's manuals.</p>

  <p>The CMRInet protocol definition is published on the NMRA web site under the
  Standards and Recommendations Section, Layout Control Specifications:
  <strong>LCS-9.10 C/MRI Introduction v1.0 (2014.12.01) and LCS-9.10.1 CMRInet v1.1 (2014.12.01).

  PCI) are not supported.</p>

  <a name="L170" id="L170"></a><h2>Introduction to C/MRI on JMRI</h2>
  <p><img alt="" src="images/splashscreen.png" width="727" height="391"></p>

  <p>C/MRI is a system of digital input and digital output lines that can be
  used to connect a computer to a model railroad layout, allowing computer
  monitoring and control of various things of the layout. The digital
  input/output device is called a node and connects to the computer using a
  simple 4-wire serial network cable.</p>

  <p>There are three types of C/MRI nodes; USIC/SUSIC, SMINI, and cpNode. The
  USIC/SUSIC and SMINI are Classic nodes. The cpNode and other Open Source/DIY
  offerings, which comply with the CMRInet protocol, are referred to as Open
  Source Nodes (OSN).</p>

  <p>The SUSIC (Super Universal Serial Interface Card) and USIC (Universal
  Serial Interface Card) are serial controller boards for a large digital I/O
  systems. A motherboard supports up to 32 digital input and digital output
  cards, with either 24 or 32 input or output lines per card. The USIC is an
  older version of the SUSIC.</p>

  <p>The SMINI (Super Mini-node) card is a stand-alone serial node providing a
  fixed 24 input lines and 48 output lines.</p>

  <p>The CPNODE (cpNode) is a standalone serial node which provides 16 to 144
  input and output lines. The cpNode uses an Arduino Leonardo style
  microprocessor and is an Open Source Node (OSN).</p>

  <p>A number of hardware interface boards are available as part of C/MRI. They
  all connect to your computer via an SMINI, a SUSIC/USIC, or cpNode. For
  example, C/MRI's DCCOD occupancy detector board connects to an input port on
  a node.</p>

  <p>Layouts which use C/MRI will commonly have several SMINI's located at
  different places on the layout, and perhaps one or two SUSIC's located at CTC
  panels. cpNodes are small physical footprint nodes, which can be distributed
  around a layout to provide connection to devices clustered in an area. All
  C/MRI node types may coexist and interoperate within a CMRInet network.</p>

  <p>C/MRI is not a train control system. You may run C/MRI with a DCC train
  control system (such as Digitrax, NCE, or Lenz) or with a DC train control
  system. And you can use JMRI with your C/MRI system whether you are using DCC
  or DC to control your trains. If you are controlling your trains with a
  system that JMRI supports, you can connect your C/MRI system and your train
  control system to JMRI simultaneously, each with its own serial input line
  into your computer.</p>

  <p>Most C/MRI users who use JMRI run with connections to both their C/MRI and
  their train control system. There are many advantages to doing so. JMRI
  allows you to "mix and match" how you control and monitor things on your
  layout. For example, you can switch your Turnouts (track switches) using
  static decoders on your train control system, and simultaneously use C/MRI
  inputs to provide Turnout Feedback to JMRI. JMRI is designed to make both
  connected systems work smoothly together.</p>

  <p>JMRI software consists of a large library of functions divided into 1) a
  system specific part, with many subparts, each of which communicates with one
  supported hardware system, like C/MRI, in a system specific way, and 2) a
  system-independent part where most of the features of JMRI are implemented.
  So, for example, if the user does something (perhaps setting a route) to
  cause JMRI to throw a Turnout (track switch), that user action will occur in
  the system-independent part of the software, and then JMRI will send out the
  actual command via the system-dependent part appropriate to the hardware
  system controlling the particular Turnout thrown. JMRI is designed so that
  features are implemented in the system-independent part as much as possible,
  with JMRI using system-dependent subparts only when really necessary. Access
  to system-independent features is via the main JMRI menus, such as the Tools
  menu.</p>

  <p>Access to system-dependent features is via a menu titled for the hardware
  system supported; C/MRI specific features are accessed via the
  <strong>C/MRI</strong> menu from the <strong>PanelPro main screen.</strong></p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/menu_CMRI.png" width="672" height="217"></p>

  <p><a name="iobits" id="iobits"></a>JMRI presents itself to users via several
  application front ends, each focusing on a type of use, but all based on the
  same underlying software library. PanelPro is the JMRI application that
  focuses on layout automation, signaling, and CTC panels. PanelPro is the
  application most often used with C/MRI, and is the one used in the examples
  below. Since all JMRI applications use the same library, it is possible to
  run a panel from DecoderPro, or even program a DCC decoder from PanelPro. The
  popular DecoderPro application focuses on programming DCC decoders.</p>

  <p>JMRI libraries have built-in support for C/MRI serial hardware using the
  SUSIC/USIC, SMINI, and cpNode. Each SUSIC/USIC, SMINI, or cpNode is a serial
  node capable of communicating independently with a computer via serial I/O.
  Several C/MRI nodes may be connected together using the RS-485 communication
  protocol in a daisy chain configuration, so that only one serial line into
  your computer is required. For this to work, each node must have a different
  unique address set into the address switches on its board or defined in the
  cpNode Kernel sketch.</p>

  <p>Each node (SUSIC/USIC, SMINI, or cpNode) needs to receive an
  initialization string before it can communicate with a computer. JMRI will
  automatically create and transmit the required initialization string when it
  starts up, but to make this possible, you need to tell JMRI the details of
  how your C/MRI hardware is set up. The process of doing this is called
  "configuring" your C/MRI Node (<a href="#L268">see below</a>).
  If you daisy chain several C/MRI nodes, you will need a C/MRI RS-232 to
  RS-422/485 conversion card or
  USB to RS-422/485 interface between the RS-422/485 bus connecting the cards
  and the RS-232 serial port to connect to your computer. If your computer does
  not have an RS-232 serial port (most newer computers don't), you can connect
  to a USB computer port with a <a href="#L632">USB-to-serial adapter</a>.</p>

  <p>C/MRI inputs are defined in JMRI as 'Sensors', and C/MRI outputs can be
  defined as JMRI 'Turnouts' or JMRI 'Lights' (<a href="#L395">see
  below</a>). Note that C/MRI inputs and outputs are sometimes called
  'bits', 'pins', or 'lines'; all are equivalent ways to refer to same
  things.</p>

  <p>CMRInet is a polled master/slave system, which means that communicating
  with C/MRI nodes requires that a "master" computer periodically sends a
  message to each "slave" node asking it to transmit the status of its' input
  bits. JMRI begins to poll a node when at least one Sensor has been set up to
  refer to an input bit on that node. It is this polling action that keeps the
  network traffic activity LEDs on the nodes flashing at a high rate. JMRI will
  transmit output data to a particular addressed node to change the state of
  the defined output bits in the node.</p>

  <a id="L215" name="L215"></a><h1>Establishing a C/MRI System Connection</h1>

  <p>Before C/MRI sensors and turnouts can be defined, a <strong>CMRInet system
  connection</strong> needs to be established. This is done from the
  <strong>Preferences</strong> window. Note: A CMRInet connection can be a
  physical hardware connection via a serial hardware interface or a simulated
  connection.</p>

  <p>To create a CMRInet connection, open the Preferences window. Click on
  <strong>Connections</strong> in the left selection box.</p>

  <p><img alt="xxx" src="images/cmripreferences.png" width="919" height="523"></p>

  <p>Select <strong>C/MRI</strong> in the <strong>System manufacturer</strong>
  menu popup. Select <strong>Serial</strong> from the <strong>System
  connection</strong> menu popup. Under <strong>Settings</strong>, select the
  name of the physical serial port on the computer. Either an RS-232 or USB
  port can be selected.</p>

  <p>Click on <strong>Additional Connection Settings</strong>, select the
  network line speed that the C/MRI nodes are configured.</p>

  <p>Click <strong>Save</strong> to create the serial connection. JMRI will
  present a dialog window asking if you want to restart, Click
  <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>

  <p>A Simulator connection is very useful if you are creating a PanelPro panel
  and do not have actual C/MRI hardware in place. </p>

  <p>To create Sensor and Turnout table entries, you must have a connection
  defined to specify the connection system. CMRInet devices use "C" as the
  default system prefix when creating System Names.</p>

  <p>To create a Simulator connection, follow the same steps above and select
  Simulator for the System connection. Be sure to <strong>Save</strong> the
  simulator connection. </p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmripreferencessimulator.png" width="919"
  height="523"></p>

  <p>A physical and simulator connection may exist at the same time, but only
  one may be active at a time. Use the <strong>Disable Connection</strong>
  checkbox to enable or disable a connection.</p>

  <a name="L258" id="L258"></a><h2>Managing Nodes</h2>

  <p>An SMINI, USIC/SUSIC, or cpNode is called a "node". A node is a point in
  the CMRInet network where the physical connections for controlled layout
  equipment is done. Before using C/MRI with JMRI, you must tell JMRI what
  nodes you have on your system and the configuration of each node.</p>

  <p>Each node has a unique node address in the range of 0 to 127. 
   Node addresses are set using switches on the SMINI and
  USIC/SUSIC boards, or entering the node number into the cpNode software
  sketch. In the C/MRI manuals, node addresses are called the Unit Address
  (UA).</p>

  <p>You can add new nodes or update an existing node's configuration by
  returning to the Preference dialog (Edit &gt; &gt;Preferences...) or by
  selecting <strong>Configure Nodes</strong> in the C/MRI menu in the main
  PanelPro window.</p>

  <p>You will need to save your Preferences after making changes to your node
  configuration. Use the "Save" button in the Preferences window to do this.</p>

  <a name="L268" id="L268"></a><h2>Configuring C/MRI Nodes</h2>
  <p><img alt="" src="images/menu_Configure_Nodes.png" width="672" height="217"></p>
  <p>CMRInet nodes are created from the Node Configuration Manager window.</p>

  <p>C/MRI nodes require certain information be established for proper
  operation within the CMRInet network. Each node type has some common
  parameters, and may have specific parameters for initialization and data port
  mapping.</p>

  <p>To open the Node Configuration Manager window from the PanelPro Main menu
  and select <strong>C/MRI</strong> -&gt; <strong>Configure Nodes</strong>. You
  may also click on the "Configure CMRInet nodes" button in the Preferences
  window. </p>

  <p>Any existing C/MRI nodes will be displayed by node address.  The serial connection name is displayed with
  additional configuration information for the node. Clicking on any of the
  column titles will sort the rows in alphanumeric order.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/nodeconfigurationmanager.png" width="1030"
  height="630"></p>

  <a name="L281" id="L281"></a><h2>Adding a Node Definition</h2>

  <p>To add a node, click the <strong>Add Node</strong> button at the bottom of
  the Node Configuration Manger window. The Add Node window will be
  displayed.</p>

  <p>There are parameters, which need to be entered for every node type. These
  entries are required and some are common to all C/MRI node types. The example
  below shows the data fields for an SMINI. See the individual sections for
  creating the specific node definitions.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/addnodew-text.png" width="579" height="691"></p>

  <p>Clicking on the <strong>Done</strong> button will close the Node
  Configuration Window.</p>

  <p>A printed list of configured nodes can be provided by clicking on the
  <strong>Print</strong> button.</p>

  <a name="L296" id="L296"></a><h2>Creating a SMINI Node Definition</h2>

  <p>Open the Node Configuration Window from either the Preferences window or
  from the PanelPro main menu, select CMRI -&gt; Configure Nodes.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/addnodesmini.png" width="654" height="780"></p>

  <p>Select <strong>SMINI</strong> from the Node Type popup menu.</p>
	<ul>
  	<li>Enter the node address in the Node Addressfield.</li>
  	<li>If required, enter Receive Delay value, otherwise leave as Zero.</li>
  	<li>If using twin coil switch motors and a different ON pulse value is required, enter that value, 
  			otherwise leave as 500.</li>
  	<li>If you are using the Yellow signal aspect
  			feature (2-lead oscillating searchlight) of the SMINI, set the check boxes as
  			needed. See the Chubb documentation on the SMINI for specific details setting
  			up this option.</li>
  	<li>The Description field provides a text entry
  			area for a description of the node. An example could be the physical area of
  			the SMINI controlled section on the layout.</li>
  	<li>Enable Polling at Startup is checked. This
  			option, when enabled, means polling of the node will start when PanelPro
  			launches. Un-checking the option will prevent the node from being polled at
  			startup.</li>
	</ul>
	
  <p>Click the <strong>Add Node</strong> button. The entries are checked for
  valid data, and if any data errors are present, an error message will be
  displayed in the Alert Message area.</p>

  <p>You must do a <strong>Save</strong> from the <strong>Preferences</strong>
  window for nodes which are added.</p>

  <a name="L323" id="L323"></a><h2>Creating a USIC/SUSIC Node Definition</h2>

  <p>Open the Node Configuration Window from either the Preferences window or
  from the PanelPro main menu, select C/MRI -&gt; Configure Nodes.</p>

  <p>Select <strong>USIC_SUSIC</strong> from the Node Type popup menu.</p>
	<ul>
  	<li>Enter the node address in the Node Address field.</li>

  	<li>Set the Card Size from the popup menu. This
  			parameter defines the type of Chubb input (DIN/DIN32) or output (DOUT,DOUT32)
  			cards which are plugged into an I/O motherboard. The USIC/SUSIC card plugs
  			into the motherboard and is the serial interface to the control computer. A
  			card size of 24-bit represent three byte cards (DIN/DOUT) and 32-bit
  			represents four byte cards (DIN32/DOUT32).</li>
  	<li>If required, enter Receive Delay value, otherwise leave as Zero.</li>
  	<li>Pulse Width is specified when using twin coil switch motors. If a different value is required, 
  			enter that value, otherwise leave as 500.</li>
  	<li>You need to define the type of card, by cardaddress (set by switches on the card), 
  			and whether the card is an input or an output. For each card installed, 
  			click on "No Card" and select "Input Card"
  			or "Output Card" for that position on the motherboard. Note that the input
  			and output cards may be in any order, but there must be no empty slots before
  			the one following the last installed card. This is a C/MRI hardware requirement</li>
  	<li>The Description field provides a text entry area for a description of the node. 
  			An example would be the physical location on the layout.</li>

  pushed, a block is occupied, etc.
  <strong>When you see a "Sensor" reference, think "input bit" or "input
  port".</strong>

  A Sensor may be created in a number of ways, including automatically. All
  JMRI Sensors which have been created may be viewed in the JMRI Sensor Table,
  which is accessed by selecting <strong>Sensor Table</strong> in the Tools
  menu in the main PanelPro window.</p>

  <p>A sensor is created by clicking the Add button at the bottom of the Sensor
  Table. Creating a Sensor to refer to a specific C/MRI input bit, is called
  "assigning" that input bit. Each input bit may be assigned only once, i.e.
  two different Sensors may not refer to the same C/MRI input bit. A Sensor is
  "active" when its assigned input bit is On and "inactive" when its input bit
  is Off.</p>

  <a name="L405" id="L405"></a><h3>Outputs - Turnout Table</h3>
  <p>JMRI refers to C/MRI output bits as Turnouts. Turnouts are on/off switches
  that JMRI can change to control things on the layout.
  <strong>When you see a "Turnout" reference, think "output bit" or "output
  port".</strong>
  For historical reasons, C/MRI output bits used to control signal aspects
  are referred to as 'Turnouts', even if the output bits are used to control
  signal mast LEDs or lamps.
  NOTE: Always use 'Turnouts' for C/MRI outputs used to control Turnouts
  (track switches) and for C/MRI outputs used to operate signals.

  Before you can refer to a Turnout within JMRI, the Turnout must be
  "created". A new Turnout is created by clicking "Add" at the bottom of that
  table. A new Turnout is created in the Turnout table as illustrated below.
  Creating a Turnout to refer to a specific C/MRI output bit, is called
  "assigning" that output bit. Each Turnout is linked to a specific output line
  via the address part of the System Name.</p>

  <p>Turnouts that have been created may be viewed in the JMRI Turnout Table,
  accessed by selecting <strong>Turnout Table</strong> in the Tools menu from
  the PanelPro main window.</p>

  <a name="L419" id="L419"></a><h3>Outputs - Light Table</h3>
  <p>Similarly, a new Light may be created via the JMRI Light Table
	<strong>When you see a "Light" reference, think "output bit" or "output
  port".</strong>

  The JMRI Light Table is accessed by selecting Lights in the Tools &gt;
  Tables menu. All JMRI Lights that have been created are listed in the JMRI
  Light Table. Turnouts and Lights are different methods of referring to C/MRI
  outputs from within JMRI. Each method has different setup and control
  options. JMRI refers to C/MRI output bits as Turnouts or Lights. Lights are
  on/off switches that JMRI can change to control things on the layout.

  The JMRI Light Table is accessed by selecting Lights in the Tools &gt;
  Tables menu. All JMRI Lights that have been created are listed in the JMRI
  Light Table. Creating a Turnout or a Light to refer to a specific C/MRI
  output bit, is called "assigning" that output bit. Each Light or Turnout is
  linked to a specific output line via the address part of the System Name.</p>

  <a name="L429" id="L429"></a><h4>Unique Output Bits</h4>
  <p>A specific output bit may be referred to as a Turnout or a Light, but not
  both. Each output bit may be assigned only once. When a new C/MRI Turnout or
  a new C/MRI Light is created, JMRI checks that the specified output bit is
  available for assignment. If the requested C/MRI output bit is in use by a
  Turnout or a Light, JMRI will refuse to create the new Turnout or new Light.
  Note that some C/MRI Turnout control options use two output bits, the
  addressed one and the next one (see next paragraph), and that both output
  bits must be unassigned for successful creation of a new Turnout controlled
  by two output bits.</p>

  <a name="L001" id="L001"></a><h2>Forming a JMRI System Name For a C/MRI Bit</h2>
  <p>C/MRI System Names are formed using the following format:
  <strong>Cpnbbb</strong> where C is the default &lt;connection prefix&gt;, p is the
  &lt;port type&gt;, n is the &lt;node number&gt; and bbb is the &lt;bit number&gt;.

  <p>System Names, which represent physical C/MRI hardware inputs or outputs,
  start with the connection prefix, "C". This assigns the System name to an
  established CMRInet connection.</p>

  The next character in the System Name is the type of physical entity the
  bit or port is connected. Sensors are designated with a "<strong>S"</strong>,
  Turnouts with a "<strong>T"</strong>, and Lights with an
  "<strong>L</strong>".

  <p>Next, is the node address as a decimal value, in the range of 0-127. While
  a node address of zero does not need to be inserted, it is preferred to
  include it for readability. Also, assigning node addresses greater than 9
  makes the System Name more readable.</p>

  <p>The last field is the physical bit position in the data stream, and
  sequentially numbered in the range of 1-999. For example, CS10024 is a C/MRI
  Sensor, for the 24th input bit on Node 10. CT8001 is the a C/MRI Turnout for
  the 1st output port on Node 8.</p>

  <p>Note: An alternate numbering scheme is available if a node has more than
  1000 bits (input or output). See the "<a href="#L447">Alternate Form For System Names</a>"
  section. For cross-user compatibility, it is recommended to use the 1-999 style for
  the numbering scheme.</p>

  <a name="L447" id="L447"></a><h3>Alternate Numbering Scheme for C/MRI System Names</h3>
  <p>An alternate scheme for numbering in C/MRI System Names was developed to
  give user access to the full number of lines allowed by C/MRI hardware
  design. The main numbering system allows access to 999 input and output lines
  on each node. The C/MRI hardware design, however, supports many more bits for
  USIC and SUSIC nodes. Most JMRI users will never need this alternate scheme,
  and should use the main numbering scheme.</p>

  <p>The alternate numbering scheme is similar to the main numbering scheme,
  except the node address and bit number are separated by a "B", and both node
  address and bit number can range to any value supported by C/MRI. The format
  is: <strong>CpnBbbb</strong> where C is the &lt;connection prefix&gt;, p is
  the &lt;port type&gt;, n is the &lt;node number&gt;, "B" is the separator for
  the node number and the bit number, and bbb is the &lt;bit number&gt;.</p>

  <p>For example, CS10B24 is a C/MRI Sensor, for the 24th input bit on Node 10.
  CT2B1009 is the a C/MRI Turnout for the 1009th output port on Node 2.</p>

  <p>Users may use either numbering scheme interchangeably for line numbers up
  to 999, but must use the alternate numbering scheme for line numbers greater
  than 999. For ease in communicating with other users, using the main
  numbering scheme is recommended unless bits greater than 999 need to be
  addressed.</p>

  <a name="L459" id="L459"></a><h2>Creating a Sensor Input</h2>
  <p>To create a sensor input, open the Sensor table by selecting
  <strong>T</strong><strong>ools -&gt; Tables -&gt; Sensors</strong> in the
  main PanelPro menu.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/sensortable.png" width="1130" height="707"></p>

  <p>Each C/MRI Sensor is assigned a "System Name". A System Name is the
  physical data bit or port on the node.</p>

  <p>A C/MRI Sensor System Name is in the format: CSnbbb, where: "C" designates
  a C/MRI system bit, "S" means the bit is a C/MRI Sensor, "n" is the node
  address, and "bbb" is the address or position of the bit in the input data
  stream.</p>

  <p>A new Sensor may be created via the Sensor Table. Creating a Sensor to
  refer to a specific C/MRI input bit, is called "assigning" that input bit.
  Each input bit may be assigned only once, i.e., two different Sensors may not
  refer to the same C/MRI input bit.</p>

  <p>Sensors have two hardware states; Active for On and Inactive for Off. A
  Sensor is "active" when the input bit is On (grounded) and "inactive" when
  its input bit is Off.</p>

  <p>A sensor can have a User Name assigned, and it is recommended that this be
  done. A User Name is a descriptive tag, which can be used by other functions
  and tables within JMRI as the reference to the actual physical bit.</p>

  <p>There needs to be one unique sensor defined for every active input bit in
  the node.</p>

  <a name="L484" id="L484"></a><h2>Creating a Turnout Output</h2>
  <p>To create a turnout output, open the Turnout table by selecting
  <strong>Tools -&gt; Tables -&gt; Turnouts</strong> in the main PanelPro
  menu.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/turnouttable.png" width="1123" height="910"></p>

  <p>Each C/MRI Turnout is assigned a "System Name". A System Name is the
  physical data bit or port on the node.</p>

  <p>A C/MRI Turnout System Name is in the format: CTnbbb, where: "C"
  designates a C/MRI system bit, "T" means the bit is a C/MRI turnout, "n" is the
  node address, and "bbb" is the address or position of the bit in the output
  data stream.</p>

  <p>A new Turnout may be created via the Turnout Table as illustrated below.
  Creating a Turnout to refer to a specific C/MRI output bit, is called
  "assigning" that input bit. Each output bit may be assigned only once, i.e.,
  two different Turnouts may not refer to the same C/MRI output bit.</p>

  <p>Turnout bits have two hardware states; Thrown for On and Closed for Off.
  These names are in place for historical reasons. When connected to actual
  switches, Closed can be "Normal" or the straight route and thrown can be
  interpreted as "Reverse" or the diverging route.</p>

  <p>A turnout can have a User Name assigned, and it is recommended that this
  be done. A User Name is a descriptive tag, which can be used by other
  functions and tables within JMRI as the reference to the actual physical bit.
  This is most useful when assigning output ports which drive signal LEDs or
  lamps.</p>

  <p>When turnout bits are used to control signal LEDs or lamps, one turnout
  (output) bit would be assigned to the connection wire to the LED or lamp.
  Multi-color (aspect) signal heads would have one output port assigned to each
  active color LED. When defining signal heads, the defined turnout name for
  the color is used to associate the LED control wires. See the example on
  defining signal heads.</p>

  <p>There needs to be one unique turnout defined for every active output bit
  in the node.</p>

  <p>Turnouts and Lights are different methods of referring to C/MRI outputs
  from within JMRI. Each method has different control options. Always use
  'Turnouts' for C/MRI outputs used to control Turnouts (track switches) and
  for C/MRI outputs used to operate signals.</p>

  <p>For historical reasons, C/MRI output bits used to control signal aspects
  are referred to as 'Turnouts', even if the output bits are used to control
  Lighted signals. Use 'Lights' to refer to C/MRI output bits used for fascia
  panel Lights, for Lights in scenery (structure Lighting, street Lights,
  etc.), and for special purposes where the control options for Lights suit
  your needs. </p>

  <p>Before you can refer to a Turnout or a Light within JMRI, the Turnout or
  Light must be "created".</p>

  <p>A Turnout may be created in a number of ways, including automatically. All
  JMRI Turnouts that have been created may be viewed in the JMRI Turnout table,
  accessed by selecting Tools -&gt; Tables -&gt; Turnouts in the main PanelPro
  menu.</p>

  <p>A new Turnout may be created via the Turnout table by clicking "Add" at
  the bottom of the table. Similarly, a new Light may be created via the JMRI
  Light Table by clicking "Add" at the bottom of that table. The JMRI Light
  Table is accessed by selecting Tools &gt; Tables -&gt; Lights Turnouts in the
  main PanelPro menu. All JMRI Lights that have been created are listed in the
  JMRI Light Table. Creating a Turnout or a Light to refer to a specific C/MRI
  output bit is called "assigning" that output bit. Each Light or Turnout is
  linked to a specific output line via the address part of the System Name.</p>

  <p>A specific output bit may be referred to as a Turnout or a Light, but not
  both. Each output bit may be assigned only once. When a new C/MRI Turnout or
  a new C/MRI Light is created, JMRI checks that the specified output bit is
  available for assignment. If the requested C/MRI output bit is in use by a
  Turnout or a Light, JMRI will refuse to create the new Turnout or new Light.
  Note that some C/MRI Turnout control options use two output bits, the
  addressed one and the next one (<a href="#L519">see next paragraph</a>), and
  that both output bits must be unassigned for successful creation of a new
  Turnout controlled by two output bits.</p>

  <a name="L519" id="L519"></a><h3>Turnout Control Options</h3>

  <p>Turnouts (switches) may be controlled using one or two output bits. When a
  Turnout is created using the Add option in the Turnout Table, the user is
  asked whether the Turnout is to be controlled using one or two output
  bits.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/turnoutnumbits.png" width="665" height="247"></p>

  <p>If "Use 1 bit" control is selected, the user must select either 'steady
  state' or 'pulsed' control.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/turnoutoutputtype.png" width="603" height="247"></p>

  <p>If 'steady state' is selected, then that output bit is set "Off" for
  CLOSED ('normal' in C/MRI manuals) or "On" for THROWN ('reverse' in C/MRI
  manuals). When setting the output bit, JMRI compares the requested state to
  the state indicated by the current value of the output bit. If these states
  are different, then the output bit is set as indicated above. If these states
  are the same, that state is compared to the state indicated by Turnout
  Feedback. If the states are the same, no action is taken since the Turnout is
  already in the requested state. If the states are different, the Turnout was
  probably changed by some means separate from JMRI. To ensure the Turnout is
  actually set to the requested state, the output bit is first changed to match
  the state indicated by the Turnout Feedback, then one second later it is
  changed again to match the requested state. This guarantees a change of state
  for those Turnout control devices that require a change in state to actually
  move the Turnout.</p>

  <p>If "Use 1 bit" option is used with "Pulsed Output" control, the output bit
  is "Off" when nothing is happening. When CLOSED or THROWN is requested, this
  request is compared to the known state of the Turnout (which follows Turnout
  Feedback). If the known state indicates the Turnout is already in the
  requested state, nothing is done. If the known state is different from the
  requested state, then the bit is 'pulsed'. A 'pulse' consists of the bit
  being turned "On" for one second, then returned to the "Off" position.</p>

  <p>If "Use 2 bits" control is selected, the bit referenced in the Turnout
  system name and the next bit in sequence are used to control the Turnout. For
  example, if CT33 has two-output-bit control, the 33rd and 34th bits are used
  to control the Turnout. If two-output-bit control is selected, the user must
  select either 'steady state' or 'pulsed' control. Steady state control should
  be selected for stall motor Turnouts, such as a Tortoise, if it is being
  controlled according to the recommendation in Chubb's C/MRI User's Manual,
  Version 3.0, page 3-12. With steady state control, for CLOSED, the first bit
  is set "Off" and the second bit is set "On"; for THROWN, the bits states are
  reversed, i.e., the first bit is set "On" and the second bit is set "Off".</p>

  <p>If "Use 2 bits" control with "Pulse Output" control is requested, both
  bits are "Off" when nothing is happening. When CLOSED or THROWN is requested,
  this request is compared to the known state of the Turnout (which follows
  Turnout Feedback). If the known state indicates the Turnout is already in the
  requested state, nothing is done. If the known state is different from the
  requested state, then the first bit is pulsed if CLOSED is requested, or the
  second bit is pulsed if THROWN is requested. In either case, a 'pulse'
  consists of the bit being turned "On" for one second, then returned to the
  "Off" position.</p>

  <p>Note that to have two-output-bit control, a Turnout must be created using
  the "Add" button in the Turnout Table.</p>

  <p>Finally, the "inverted" option can be selected. This controls how the
  C/MRI hardware implements the "On" and "Off" used in the description above.
  Normally (invert option not selected), "On" refers to a "1" to the hardware;
  with standard C/MRI hardware, this pulls the output pin down and allows it to
  sink current. "Off" the corresponds to a "0" to the hardware, turning the
  output pin off, and causing it to stop sinking current. When "invert" is
  selected, "On" results in a "0" sent to the hardware, and "Off" results in a
  "1" being sent. This causes the hardware to act with the opposite
  polarity.</p>

  <a name="L547" id="L547"></a><h2>Creating a Light Output</h2>

  <p>To create a Lights output, open the Light table by selecting Tools -&gt;
  Tables -&gt; Lights in the main PanelPro menu.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/lightstable.png" width="1123" height="505"></p>

  <p>Each C/MRI Light is assigned a "System Name". A System Name is the
  physical data bit or port on the node.</p>

  <p>A C/MRI Light System Name is in the format: CHnbbb, where: "C" designates
  a C/MRI system bit, "T" means the bit is a C/MRI turnout, "n" is the node
  address, and "bbb" is the address or position of the bit in the output data
  stream.</p>

  <a name="L562" id="L562"></a><h1>CMRInet Network Management Tools</h1>

  <p>The C/MRI menu contains three tools which are used to manage nodes in a
  CMRInet network. Controlling the polling of nodes, displaying the operational
  states of configured nodes, and monitoring the data message traffic on the
  network are all functions available in the tool suite.</p>

  <a name="L568" id="L568"></a><h2>CMRInet Network Manager</h2>

  <p>The CMRInet Manager is selected by selecting the <strong>C/MRI Network Manager</strong> 
  menu item from the <strong>C/MRI</strong> menu.</p>

  <p>The CMRInet Manager displays the status of each configured node. Polling of
  individual nodes can be enabled or disabled by checking the
  <strong>Enabled</strong> check box for the node. The <strong>Status</strong>
  column shows the real time state of the node.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/menu_Network_Manager.png" width="699" height="219"></p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetnetworkmanager.png" width="830" height="580"></p>

  <a name="L580" id="L580"></a><h2>CMRInet Packet Monitor</h2>

  <p>CMRInet protocol messages can be viewed by selecting <strong>C/MRI
  Monitor</strong> from the <strong>C/MRI</strong> menu in main PanelPro window.
  The monitor window decodes and formats the CMRInet data message to a readable
  form. The message traffic is displayed in real time with options selected by
  the user. The window has a scroll bar which will move the display up or down
  so messages which are off view can be seen.</p>

  <p>The data display may scroll by very quickly, depending upon the network
  line speed. Clicking on the <strong>Freeze Display</strong> button will stop
  the display from scrolling. Data messages will still be collected but not
  displayed until the <strong>Resume Display</strong> button is clicked. A text
  message tag can be inserted into the data display (and log file) by typing
  the text into the field next to the Add Message button. Click on the
  <strong>Add Message</strong> button to insert the text into the display.</p>

  <p>Data messages can be captured into a text file and saved for later viewing
  and analysis. Click on <strong>Choose Log File</strong>. A file create dialog
  window will open. Select a file name to save the data, then close the window.
  This action only creates the file for data capture. Click the <strong>Start
  Logging</strong> button to start the collection of data. Clicking
  <strong>Stop Logging</strong> will stop the data capture and close the log
  file.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/menu_Monitor.png" width="672" height="217"></p>

  <p>The following screen shows polling with responses for nodes 20 and 21. </p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetmonitor-pollresponse.png" width="997"
  height="480"></p>

  <p>There are display option checkboxes which provide additional information
  and formatting for the messages.</p>

  <p>If the <strong>Show Timestamps</strong> check box option is checked, each
  message is prefixed with the system time in the form of hh:mm:ss:mss. 
  <p>The
  message type (e.g Receive) and node address (ua) are displayed next. The "IB"
  are the input data bytes.
  Each byte is displayed as a separate hexadecimal number.</p>


  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetmonitor-pollresponsetimestamp.png"
  width="1040" height="559"></p>

  <p>Here are examples of the Initialization messages for each of the node
  types.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetinit-USICSUSIC.png" width="426" height="255"></p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetinit-SMINI.png" width="427" height="169"></p>

  <p>The following screen shows the node initialization message sequence for
  node 20, followed by the node coming on line and responding to polls. The
  <strong>Init</strong> message shows the node address (ua) of 20, followed by
  the node type (NDP) of C which is a cpNode. DL is the delay value, and Opts
  are node options entered in the node configuration window. A
  <strong>Transmit</strong> message follows with the node address (ua) of 20.
  OB are the output data bytes as hexadecimal values. Polls are seen
  followed by the poll/response sequence.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetmonitor-pollinitialization.png"
  width="904" height="559"></p>

  <p>If a node goes off line and stops responding to polls, JMRI will initiate
  an initialization sequence consisting of five polls. If five polls result in
  no responses (timeouts) the Init/Transmit message sequence will be done. This
  poll/init/transmit message sequence is repeated until the node comes back on
  line.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetmonitor-polltimeoutinit.png" width="1018"
  height="561"></p>

  <p>The following screen shows a poll to node 20, followed by a response, then
  output bytes sent to the node.</p>
  
  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetmonitor-transmitmessage.png" width="1040" height="586"></p>

  <p>The following screen shows all of the display options enabled. The order
  of options is:</p>

  <p style="margin-left:2em;"><strong>timestamp</strong>s as hh:mm:ss:mss,
  <strong>raw data</strong> in hexadecimal, <strong>data message</strong></p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetmonitor-timestampraw.png" width="997" height="480"></p>

  <p>CMRInet messages can be filtered from display by clicking the
  <strong>Filter Packets</strong> button. The packet filter window lets you
  select the nodes and message type to display in the monitor window. The
  <strong>Select Nodes</strong>, <strong>Select Packets</strong> buttons allow
  for quick select or de-select of the filters. Clicking the <strong>Halt
  Poll</strong> button will stop network polling. Clicking <strong>Resume
  Polling</strong> will restart polling.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetworkpacketfilter.png" width="700" height="455"></p>

  <a name="L597" id="L597"></a><h2>CMRInet Network Metrics</h2>

  <p>Anytime the CMRInet is active, a network metrics collector is running in
  the background. The metrics collected are errors and performance or
  instrumentation data. CMRInet metrics can be viewed by selecting
  <strong>C/MRI Network Metrics</strong> from the <strong>C/MRI</strong> menu in main
  PanelPro window</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/menu_Network_Metrics.png" width="702" height="219"></p>

  <p>Each of the Error and Data Metric values can be reset to zero by clicking
  the appropriate <strong>Reset</strong> button. All of the metrics can be
  reset to zero by clicking the <strong>Reset All</strong> button. Metric data
  can be saved to a text file by clicking on the <strong>Save Metrics</strong>
  button. A file create dialog window will open, enter a file name for the
  metric data. &lt;PHOTO-CMRInet Metrics&gt;</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/cmrinetworkmetrics.png" width="925" height="480"></p>

  <a name="L609" id="L609"></a><h2>Listing C/MRI Bit Assignments</h2>
  
  <p>For each node, you can view a summary list of C/MRI bits that are in use
  and those that are available.</p>

  <p>Select <strong>List Assignments</strong> in the C/MRI main menu or from
  the Select column in the Node Configuration Manager to bring up Bit
  Assignments window.</p>
  <p><img alt="" src="images/menu_List_Assignments.png" width="672" height="217"></p>

  <p>List Assignments is useful for checking that you have configured the
  correct numbers of input and output bits and the correct node address for
  each node. The Assignment Table contains a line for each configured input or
  output bit. Each line also contains an address column showing what address to
  use for that bit in JMRI's C/MRI system names. Printing blank assignment
  lists for each node provides a convenient paper form for use in setting up
  your input/output bit assignments. The Comment field information is also
  displayed.</p>

  <a name="L624" id="L624"></a><h1>Diagnostics</h1>
  <p>Diagnostics are useful for checking the functioning of your C/MRI hardware. 
  These automated procedures are controlled via a dialog available by selecting 
  Run Diagnostics in the C/MRI menu.  Some of the diagnostic tests require external hardware
  to operate.  Chapter 6 of Bruce Chubb's C/MRI User's Manual, Version 3.0, describes
  a test output card and loopback cable.  These items connect to input and output ports
  on Classic nodes and provide hardware devices which are driven by the diagnostic test
  code.  An integrated test card (IOTEST) from MRCS provides compatible test hardware 
  support.
  </p>
  <p>By opening the C/MRI Monitor, the test message traffic can be viewed.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/diagmain.png" width="698" height="612"></p>
  <p>The C/MRI Diagnostics window has five sections.</p>
  <p><b>Test Node</b> provides a popup menu for the selection of the node to be tested. 
  The menu only displays the addresses of configured nodes for the connection.  Node type
  and card assignment information for the selected node are displayed.
  </p>
  <p><b>Test Suite</b> has the test selection popup menu which lists available
  tests.  The suggested equipment needed to run the test is also listed.  The Halt polling
  button stops polling of nodes on the connection.  Polling should be halted when running
  diagnostics so as not to interfere with the test sequences. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Test Set Up</b> provides user input fields for data card selection and options
  for each test suite.
  </p>
  <p><b>Status</b> displays the progress of the running tests and any error messages
  related to the test sequences.
  </p>
  <p><b>Test Control</b> buttons displayed at the bottom of the window control the various
  test sequences and are specific to each test suite.
  </p>

  <a name="L625" id="L625"></a><h2>Output Test</h2>
  <p>The Output Test writes a walking bit pattern to the output test card, lighting the
  LEDs corresponding to the bit pattern.  The number of bits written is based upon card
  size (8, 24, 32).  The Output Card number is checked to be a valid defined output card.
  Observation delay is the number of milliseconds delay between each write. Checking the
  Invert box flips the state of the bits.  This is useful for output cards which drive 
  Common Anode (sinking) devices.
  </p>
  <p><img alt="" src="images/diagoutputtest.png" width="698" height="612"></p>

  <a name="L626" id="L626"></a><h2>Loopback Test</h2>
  <p>The Loopback Test uses a loopback cable connected to a card of outputs and a card
  of inputs.  The test writes a data value pattern to each output port and reads the
  value from the corresponding input port.  The input value is compared to the output
  value and displays any comparison errors.  If a compare error occurs, the test is 
  paused.  Clicking the Continue button will write the next value to the output. 
  Observation Delay and Filtering Delay adds time delay intervals to the write and read 
  operations.  Invert works the same as in the Output Test.
  </p>

  <a name="L627" id="L627"></a><h2>Send Commands</h2>
  <p>Send Commands provides raw CMRInet packet transmissions to the test node.</p>
  <p><b>Initialize Node</b> transmits an Initialize (I) message to the node.  The node
  would then execute the onboard initialize code.</p>
  <p><b>Poll Node</b> transmits a poll message (P) to the node.  The count of input 
  bytes in the response is returned.  If the node does not respond to the poll, a 
  timeout error is reported.</p>
  <p><b>Write Bytes</b> transmits (T) the user entered byte string to the output card 
  number.  The bytes need to be entered as hexadecimal values separated by a space.  
  The maximum number of bytes written is the defined by size of the card (1, 3, 4).  
  Invert works the same as in the Output Test.</p>

  <a name="L632" id="L632"></a><h1>CMRInet Network Connections</h1>
  <p>Using USB-serial adapters</p>

  <p>Most C/MRI systems use RS-422/485 electrical signals to communicate
  between the nodes and the computer. There are several ways to generate
  them:</p>

  <p style="margin-left:2em;">1. If your computer has a built-in serial port
  (RS-232 connection), you can use an RS-232 to RS-422/485 convertor. There's
  one you can build as part of the C/MRI system, or you can buy a commercial
  one.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:2em;">2. If your computer has a USB port, you can buy a
  commercial USB to RS-422/485 adapter and use that.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:2em;">3. If your computer has a USB port and you have a
  RS232 to RS-422/485 convertor, you can install a USB-to-RS232 adapter
  (sometimes called a "USB-to-serial converter"), then connect the RS232 output
  of that to the RS232 input of the RS232 to RS-422/485 convertor.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:2em;">Note that if you're using the Chubb
  RS232-to-RS-422/485 converter, some USB-to-RS232 adapters will require that
  you connect certain RS232 control leads that are not handled by the Chubb
  interface board:</p>

  <p style="margin-left:2em;">o DSR - DTR (pins 4 &amp; 6 on the DB9
  connector)o RTS - CTS (pins 7 &amp; 8 on the DB9 connector)</p>

  <p style="margin-left:0em">In all cases, the communications line will end up
  appearing as a serial port on your computer. In Windows, this is a COM port,
  in other computers it's a named serial device. You will need to select the
  proper one when configuring JMRI. If no serial devices appear in the
  selection popup menu, you may not have any operating system serial device
  drivers installed.</p>

  <a name="L652" id="L652"></a><h3>Using An Ethernet Network Connection</h3>

  <p>JMRI allows you to connect to C/MRI nodes through a network connection.
  JMRI communicates via the TCP/IP protocol across a network to a
  network-to-serial adapter, which converts the network connection to a serial
  stream that then goes through a RS-422/485 convertor to the C/MRI node(s).</p>

  <p>The network-to-serial adapter is sometimes called a "terminal server".
  It's also sometimes called a "Lantronix box" after an early manufacturer of
  these, though they're now available from multiple sources. The adapter has to
  be configured with the correct serial parameters for your C/MRI system,
  including the proper baud rate and 8-data-bits, no parity. You will probably
  need a RS232-to-RS-422/485 adapter on the output of the network adapter.</p>

  <p>Some hobbyists have also built C/MRI nodes that have native Ethernet
  connections. JMRI communicates with them via a direct TCP/IP connection using
  the C/MRI protocol, but in this case there's no need for a RS-422/485
  convertor.</p>

  <p>To configure JMRI to use a network connection, go to the Preferences
  screen, Connections tab. After selecting C/MRI for the System Manufacturer,
  select "Network Interface" for the System Connection. Then enter the IP
  address (or node name, if it has one) of your network-to-serial adapter in
  the IP Address / Host Name field. If it uses a non-standard port number,
  check the Additional Configuration Settings box and enter the port number.
  Click Save and restart the program.</p>

  <a name="L662" id="L662"></a><h3>Running JMRI when disconnected from your C/MRI system</h3>

  <p>JMRI continually polls the C/MRI hardware for status changes. If one or
  more C/MRI nodes are not responding, eventually their inputs (Sensors) are
  set to the UNKNOWN state to indicate that JMRI has lost contact with those
  devices on the layout.</p>

  <p>Although this is the right thing to do when you're really connected to the
  hardware and trying to operate the layout, it can get in the way if you're
  running JMRI without your layout connection. You might want to do this, for
  example, to work on your panels while away from the layout, or while the
  layout needs to be powered off for some reason.</p>

  <p>To accommodate using JMRI without an active layout connection, in the JMRI
  2.3.2 release a "C/MRI Simulator" connection was made available in the
  Preferences.</p>

  <p>Please note that this is only meant for users who already have a working
  C/MRI connection already configured. Please do not try to use the C/MRI
  simulator before configuring a valid connection to C/MRI hardware, as it will
  not work.</p>

  <p>Once you have your C/MRI connection configured, when your hardware is not
  available you can just go to the JMRI Preferences, select "C/MRI Simulator",
  save Preferences, quit and restart. Don't change any other settings!</p>

  <p>When the C/MRI hardware is again available, go the JMRI Preferences,
  select "C/MRI Serial", save Preferences, quit and restart.</p>

  <a name="L676" id="L676"></a><h1>PanelPro Signaling Example Using C/MRI</h1>

  <p>The following is an example of what is needed to create a simple ABS
  signaling system using an SMINI node and Control Panel Editor (CPE) in
  PanelPro. The SMINI will be set to node address 15.</p>

  <p>The focus of the example is to show the relationship between the input and
  output ports (bits) on the SMINI and the logical connection to the various
  JMRI device tables. Only the device table information will be defined. The
  required Logix and Conditionals will not be described.</p>

  <p>The section to be signaled is a classic mainline/passing siding triad. The
  operating scheme is assumed to be Automatic Block System (ABS), with the
  trains given written authority to occupy the track segments and operate the
  switches if needed. Block occupancy and turnout position determine signal
  aspects. All Stop aspects are Absolute.</p>

  <p>Signals, which control the entrance and exit to the siding, will display
  only Yellow (Approach) and Red (Stop) as it is assumed these are low speed
  routes.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/example-ruckersection.png" width="627" height="399"></p>

  <p>Sensors are the block occupancy detectors and two fascia toggle switches
  controlling the turnouts. The detectors will present an Active state when a
  block is occupied, and Inactive when a block is vacant. The switch controls,
  will present Inactive for the turnout in Normal, and Active if the turnout is
  Reverse.</p>

  <p>Inputs are assigned to Card 2, ports A0 through B0. The output of block
  detector BLK78 is connected to SMINI Node 15, Sensor input, Card 2, port A0.
  The comment field is used to document the physical SMINI port and a
  description of the track section.</p>

  <p>By referring to the port names printed on the SMINI circuit board, the
  connection is path is fully defined. User Names are used when writing Logix
  statements. A consistent naming scheme should be adopted for creating easy
  references in the Logix Conditionals. One should be able to look at a User
  Name and immediately identify what type of device is connected to the
  port.</p>

  <p>The Sensor table is a live view of the state of the port. For Sensors,
  applying a signal ground to the port will cause the State to change from
  Inactive to Active. This technique is a great way to verify if the node is
  communicating with the Master and that the port assignments match the actual
  connected device.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/example-sensortable.png" width="1153" height="449"></p>

  <p>Outputs are defined in the Turnout table. As described earlier, the name
  "turnout" is historical. Again, just think of turnouts as the output ports.
  Output states are Closed for Off, and Thrown for On. If the port is connected
  to an actual turnout, Closed would normally be "Normal" and Thrown would be
  "Reverse". The "Cmd" column displays the live state of the port. Clicking on
  the Cmd button will toggle the turnout from Closed to Thrown. This capability
  can be used to test connections and proper operation of output devices.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/example-turnouttable.png" width="1158" height="970"></p>

  <p>There are two output ports assigned to turnout controller bits. The
  turnout control bits are assigned to Card 0, ports A0 through C7, and Card 1
  port A0. The turnout motor control bit for SW35 is connected to SMINI Node
  15, Turnout output, Card 0, port A0.</p>

  <p>Six signal masts are required for signaling. Two are dual head with an
  upper and lower head. LED's are assumed to be the lamps used for aspect
  illumination. One output bit is required for each color. All LED commons are
  tied together. Signal mast 80LA is a single head signal.</p>

  <p>There are three LEDs in the head; Green, Yellow, and Red. Each wire
  attached to a color LED must be connected to an output port. The green LED
  for signal 80LA (SG80LA-G) is connected to SMINI node 15, turnout, bit 10,
  Card 0, port B1.</p>
