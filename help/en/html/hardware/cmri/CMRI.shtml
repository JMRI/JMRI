      <h2 id="top">Using C/MRI with JMRI</h2>

      <p>This documentation describes how C/MRI hardware (including microcontrollers emulating
      C/MRI hardware) can be used with JMRI. It also provides guidance on connecting a C/MRI system
      to JMRI. It assumes a basic knowledge of JMRI and some familiarity with C/MRI.</p>

      <p>If you are using C/MRI hardware, it is highly recommended that you have access to Bruce
      Chubb's <a href="https://www.jlcenterprises.net/pages/downloads" target="_blank">C/MRI User
      Manual, Version 3.0</a> which contains detailed hardware documentation not available
      elsewhere. Since JMRI takes the place of the control software described, you can skip over
      computer programming details in the manual. Excellent descriptions of various signaling
      systems and model railroad layout device controls are also presented in Dr. Chubb's
      manuals.</p>

      <p>If you are using microcontrollers such as the <a href="https://arduino.cc" target=
      "_blank">arduino</a> to emulate C/MRI hardware, additional information on their use with JMRI
      can be found on the <a href="../arduino/index.shtml">Using Arduinos with JMRI</a> help
      page.</p>

      <p>The network over which C/MRI hardware communicates with JMRI is called <em>CMRInet</em>.
      The CMRInet protocol definition is published by the <a href="https://www.nmra.org" target=
      "_blank">NMRA</a> under the Standards and Recommendations Section, <a href=
      "https://www.nmra.org/sites/default/files/standards/sandrp/Other_Specifications/lcs-9.10.1_cmrinet_v1.1.pdf"
      target="_blank">Layout Control Specifications: LCS-9.10 C/MRI Introduction v1.0 (2014.12.01)
      and LCS-9.10.1 CMRInet v1.1 (2014.12.01).</a><br></p>

      <h2 id="intro">Introduction to C/MRI on JMRI</h2>

      <p>C/MRI is an object control system of digital input and output lines that can connect a
      computer to a model railroad layout, allowing computer monitoring and control of various
      objects on the layout such as turnouts, sensors, signals, lights, and even animations. You
      may run C/MRI with any train control system, whether DC or DCC. If you are controlling your
      trains with a train control system that JMRI supports, you can connect your C/MRI system and
      your train control system to JMRI simultaneously.</p>

      <p>Most C/MRI users who use JMRI run with connections to both their C/MRI and their train
      control system. There are many advantages to doing so. JMRI allows you to "mix and match" how
      you control and monitor things on your layout. For example, you can switch your Turnouts
      (track switches) using static decoders on your train control system, and simultaneously use
      C/MRI inputs to provide Turnout Feedback to JMRI. JMRI is designed to make both connected
      systems work smoothly together.</p>

      <p>PanelPro is the JMRI application most often used to manage a C/MRI system, and is the one
      used in the examples below. Since all JMRI applications use the same underlying library, it
      is also possible to run C/MRI functions from DecoderPro. Access to C/MRI system-specific
      features is via a menu pulldown titled for the specific hardware connection. The picture
      below shows the C/MRI specific menu pulldown from the <strong>PanelPro main
      screen.</strong></p>

      <p><img alt="" src="images/menu_CMRI.png" width="672" height="217">
      </p>

      <p>Devices providing the digital input and output lines are called "nodes." Nodes connect to
      the computer using a serial network or a USB interface. Microcontrollers can be programmed to
      emulate C/MRI nodes and connect to a computer in a similar manner.</p>

      <p>C/MRI inputs are defined in JMRI as 'Sensors', and C/MRI outputs can be defined as JMRI
      'Turnouts' or JMRI 'Lights' (<a href="#L395">see below</a>). Note that C/MRI inputs and
      outputs are sometimes called 'bits', 'pins', or 'lines'; all refer to the same things.</p>

      <p>CMRInet is a polled master/slave system, which means that communicating with C/MRI nodes
      requires that a "master" computer (in this case, JMRI) periodically sends a message asking
      each of its "slave" nodes to transmit the status of its input bits (Sensors to JMRI). JMRI
      allows multiple C/MRI connections to be defined, thus creating multiple "masters" that
      communicate only with the slave nodes defined specifically to each. JMRI begins to poll a
      node on a particular C/MRI connection when at least one Sensor has been set up to refer to an
      input bit on that node. It is this polling action that keeps the network traffic activity
      LEDs on the nodes flashing at a high rate. JMRI will also transmit data (Turnout and Light
      state) to nodes to change the state of output bits for that node.</p>

      <h3 id="L46">Types of C/MRI Nodes</h3>
      <!-- FOURTH TYPE OF NODE IN PULLDOWN MENU: CPMEGA TBD 2020/12/08 -->

      <p>There are three types of C/MRI nodes; USIC/SUSIC, SMINI, and cpNode [more may be added in
      the future]. The USIC/SUSIC and SMINI are Classic nodes. The cpNode and other Open Source/DIY
      offerings, which comply with the CMRInet protocol, are referred to as Open Source Nodes
      (OSN).</p>

      <p>The SUSIC (Super Universal Serial Interface Card) and USIC (Universal Serial Interface
      Card) are serial controller boards for a large digital I/O systems. A motherboard supports up
      to 32 digital input and digital output cards, with either 24 or 32 input or output lines per
      card. The USIC is an older version of the SUSIC.</p>

      <p>The SMINI (Super Mini-node) card is a stand-alone serial node providing a fixed 24 input
      lines and 48 output lines.</p>

      <p>Software is generally available for microcontrollers to emulate SMINIs and SUSICs of any
      size. See the <a href="../arduino/index.shtml#CMRI">Emulating a CMRI node</a> help page for
      more information.</p>

      <p>The CPNODE (cpNode) is a standalone serial node which provides 16 to 144 input and output
      lines. The cpNode uses an Arduino Leonardo style microcontroller and is an Open Source Node
      (OSN).</p>

      <p>A number of hardware interface boards are available as part of C/MRI. They all connect to
      your computer via an SMINI, a SUSIC/USIC, or cpNode. For example, C/MRI's DCCOD occupancy
      detector board connects to an input port on a node.</p>

      <p>Layouts which use C/MRI will commonly have several SMINI's located at different places on
      the layout, and perhaps one or two SUSIC's located at CTC panels. cpNodes are small physical
      footprint nodes, which can be distributed around a layout to provide connection to devices
      clustered in an area. All C/MRI node types, including microcontrollers emulating any of these
      types, may coexist and interoperate within a CMRInet network.</p>

      <p>JMRI libraries have built-in support for C/MRI serial hardware using the SUSIC/USIC,
      SMINI, and cpNode. Each SUSIC/USIC, SMINI, or cpNode is a serial node capable of
      communicating independently with a computer via serial I/O. Several C/MRI nodes may be
      connected together using the RS-485 communication protocol in a daisy chain configuration so
      that only one serial line into your computer is required. For this to work, each node must
      have a different unique address set into the address switches on its board, defined in the
      cpNode Kernel sketch, or specified in the emulation software of a microcontroller. You will
      need a C/MRI RS-232 to RS-422/485 conversion card or USB to RS-422/485 interface between the
      RS-422/485 bus connecting the cards and the RS-232 or USB port on your computer (see <a href=
      "#L632">CMRINet Network Connections</a> below). More than one chain can be defined to JMRI as
      well with each chain requiring a separate designation within JMRI (see <a href=
      "#L215">Establishing a C/MRI System Connection in JMRI</a> below).</p>

      <p>Each node (SUSIC/USIC, SMINI, or cpNode) needs to receive an initialization string before
      it can communicate with a computer. JMRI will automatically create and transmit the required
      initialization string when it starts up, but to make this possible, you need to tell JMRI the
      details of how your C/MRI hardware is set up. The process of doing this is called
      "configuring" your C/MRI Node (<a href="#L268">see below</a>).</p>

      <h2 id="L215">Establishing a C/MRI System Connection in JMRI</h2>

      <p>Before C/MRI objects can be defined, a <strong>CMRInet system connection</strong> needs to
      be defined within JMRI. This is done from the <strong>Preferences</strong> window. A CMRInet
      connection can be a physical hardware connection via a serial interface (including USB), a
      network connection via TCP/IP (wired or wireless), or a simulated connection. More than one
      JMRI system connection can be defined if you have multiple CMRINet connections to your
      computer (including multiple connections of the same type).</p>

      <h3>Serial Connection</h3>

      <p>To create a CMRInet serial connection, open the Preferences window. Click on
      <strong>Connections</strong> in the left selection box.</p>
      <img alt="CMRI Prefs - Serial" src="images/cmripreferencesserial-rel4-21-3.png" width="834"
      height="502">
      <p>Select <strong>C/MRI</strong> in the <strong>System manufacturer</strong> menu popup.
      Select <strong>Serial</strong> from the <strong>System connection</strong> menu popup.</p>

      <p>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, select the name of the physical serial port on the
      computer. Either an RS-232 or USB port known to the system can be selected.</p>

      <p>"C" is the default <strong>Connection Prefix</strong> for C/MRI. That is, C/MRI objects
      will automatically use that prefix in their system name. For example, a C/MRI sensor will
      have a system name beginning with "CS" ("S" for sensor). The default can be changed if
      necessary. If you have more than one C/MRI connection, you must use different connection
      prefixes for each, such as "C2", "C3", etc.</p>

      <p>Click on <strong>Additional Connection Settings</strong>, select the network line speed
      rate that the C/MRI nodes are configured for.</p>

      <p>Click <strong>Save</strong> to create the serial connection. JMRI will present a dialog
      window asking if you want to restart.<br>
      Click <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Network Connection</h3>

      <p>To create a CMRInet network connection, open the Preferences window. Click on
      <strong>Connections</strong> in the left selection box.</p>

      will automatically use that prefix in their system name. For example, a C/MRI sensor will
      have a system name beginning with "CS" ("S" for sensor). The default can be changed if
      necessary. If you have more than one C/MRI connection, you must have different connection
      prefixes for each, such as "C2", "C3", etc.</p>

      <p>Click on <strong>Additional Connection Settings</strong> and specify the TCP/UDP Port that
      the CMRINet is broadcasting on. Output interval can be varied if communications problems
      arise.</p>

      <p>Click <strong>Save</strong> to create the network connection. JMRI will present a dialog
      window asking if you want to restart.<br>
      Click <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Simulator</h3>

      <p>A Simulator connection is very useful if you are creating a PanelPro panel and do not have
      actual C/MRI hardware in place or want to test without being connected to your layout. Once
      you define a C/MRI simulator connection, you can define any JMRI objects as C/MRI objects. As
      with other connection types, "C" is the default <strong>Connection Prefix</strong>. A
      physical and simulator connection using the same Connection Prefix may be defined at the same
      time, but only one may be active at a time. Use the <strong>Disable Connection</strong>
      checkbox to enable or disable a connection.</p>

      <p>If you have more than one active C/MRI connection, including simulators, you must have
      different connection prefixes for each, such as "C2", "C3", etc. You can also define a
      <a href="../../setup/profiles.shtml">JMRI Configuration Profile</a> for testing with
      simulator connections replacing each of your physical C/MRI connections.</p>

      <p>To create a Simulator connection, follow the same steps above and select Simulator for the
      System connection. Be sure to <strong>Save</strong> after defining Simulator connections.</p>

      <h2 id="L258">Managing Nodes</h2>

      <p>An SMINI, USIC/SUSIC, or cpNode is called a "node". A node is a point in the CMRInet
      network where the physical connections for controlled layout equipment is done. Before using
      C/MRI with JMRI, you must tell JMRI what nodes you have attached to each C/MRI system
      connection and the configuration of each node.</p>

      <p>Each node has a unique node address in the range of 0 to 127. Two nodes on the same C/MRI
      system connection may not have the same node number. However, nodes on different connections
      may have the same node address since each connection describes a totally separate CMRInet
      network.</p>

      <p>Node addresses are set using switches on the SMINI and USIC/SUSIC boards, by entering the
      node number into the cpNode software sketch, or as required in the emulation software of a
      microcontroller. In the C/MRI manuals, node addresses are called the Unit Address (UA).</p>

      <p>You can add new nodes or update an existing node's configuration via the main PanelPro
      window, either by</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Edit⇒Preferences⇒Connections</strong>, or</li>

        <li><strong>C/MRI⇒Configure Nodes</strong> (using the appropriate C/MRI menu for each
        connection)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You will need to save your Preferences after making changes to your node configuration.
      Use the "Save" button in the Preferences window to do this.</p>

      </p>

      <p>CMRInet nodes are created from the Node Configuration Manager window.</p>

      <p>C/MRI nodes require certain information be established for proper operation within the
      CMRInet network. Each node type has some common parameters, and may have specific parameters
      for initialization and data port mapping.</p>

      <p>To open the Node Configuration Manager window from the PanelPro Main menu, select the name
      of the specific C/MRI connection to get the pulldown. If there is only a single C/MRI

      <h2 id="iobits">C/MRI Input and Output Bits - JMRI Tables</h2>

      <p><img alt="" src="images/menu_Tools_Tables.png" width="680" height="400">
      </p>

      <p>JMRI refers to C/MRI Input bits as <strong>Sensors</strong> and Output bits as
      <strong>Turnouts</strong> or <strong>Lights</strong>. The definition of Sensors, Turnouts,
      and Lights is done by adding entries into the appropriate data table. Tables are accessed by
      selecting from the PanelPro main screen <strong>Tools⇒Tables⇒{table name}</strong></p>

      <p>A specific input or output bit may be assigned to only one object at a time. If the
      requested C/MRI bit has already been assigned, JMRI will refuse to associate a new object
      with that bit. Input bits are only associated with Sensors. Output bits are associated either
      with Turnouts or Lights, but a particular bit can only be associated with one at a time. When
      a new Turnout or Light is created, JMRI checks that the specified output bit is available for
      assignment.</p>

      <p>Assigned and unassigned bits can be viewed using the <a href="#L609">List I/O Bit
      Assignments</a> tool.</p>

      <h3 id="L395">Inputs - Sensor Table</h3>

      <p>Sensors provide input to JMRI about conditions on the layout; a button is pushed, a block
      is occupied, etc. <strong>When you see a "Sensor" reference, think "input bit" or "input
      port".</strong></p>

      <p>A Sensor may be created in a number of ways, including automatically. All JMRI Sensors
      which have been created may be viewed in the JMRI Sensor Table, which is accessed by
      selecting <strong>Sensor Table</strong> in the Tools menu in the main PanelPro window.</p>

      <p>A sensor is created by clicking the Add button at the bottom of the Sensor Table. Creating
      a Sensor to refer to a specific C/MRI input bit, is called "assigning" that input bit. Each
      input bit may be assigned only once, i.e. two different Sensors may not refer to the same
      C/MRI input bit. A Sensor is "active" when its assigned input bit is On and "inactive" when
      its input bit is Off.</p>

      <h3 id="L405">Outputs - Turnout Table</h3>

      <p>Turnouts are basically on/off switches that JMRI can change to control things on the
      layout. C/MRI output bits are associated with Turnouts so <strong>when you see a "Turnout"
      reference, think "output bit" or "output port".</strong></p>

      <p>For historical reasons, C/MRI output bits used to control signal aspects are referred to
      as 'Turnouts', even if the output bits are used to control signal mast LEDs or lamps. NOTE:
      Always use 'Turnouts' for C/MRI outputs used to control Turnouts (track switches) and for
      C/MRI outputs used to operate signals.</p>

      <p>Before you can refer to a Turnout within JMRI, the Turnout must be "created". A new
      Turnout is created by clicking "Add" at the bottom of that table. A new Turnout is created in
      the Turnout table as illustrated below. Creating a Turnout to refer to a specific C/MRI
      output bit, is called "assigning" that output bit. Each Turnout is linked to a specific
      output line via the address part of the System Name.</p>

      <p>Turnouts that have been created may be viewed in the JMRI Turnout Table, accessed by
      selecting <strong>Turnout Table</strong> in the Tools menu from the PanelPro main window.</p>

      <h3 id="L419">Outputs - Light Table</h3>

      <p>Similarly, Lights are controlled by C/MRI output bits. <strong>When you see a "Light"
      reference, think "output bit" or "output port".</strong> Lights can be created via the Light
      Table.</p>

      <p>The JMRI Light Table is accessed by selecting Lights in the Tools &gt; Tables menu. All
      JMRI Lights that have been created are listed in the JMRI Light Table. Turnouts and Lights
      are different methods of referring to C/MRI outputs from within JMRI. Each method has
      different setup and control options. JMRI refers to C/MRI output bits as Turnouts or Lights.
      Lights are on/off switches that JMRI can change to control things on the layout.</p>

      <p>The JMRI Light Table is accessed by selecting Lights in the Tools &gt; Tables menu. All
      JMRI Lights that have been created are listed in the JMRI Light Table. Creating a Turnout or
      a Light to refer to a specific C/MRI output bit, is called "assigning" that output bit. Each
      Light or Turnout is linked to a specific output line via the address part of the System
      Name.</p>

      <h3 id="L429">Unique Output Bits</h3>

      <p>A specific output bit may be referred to as a Turnout or a Light, but not both. Each
      output bit may be assigned only once. When a new C/MRI Turnout or a new C/MRI Light is
      created, JMRI checks that the specified output bit is available for assignment. If the
      requested C/MRI output bit is in use by a Turnout or a Light, JMRI will refuse to create the
      new Turnout or new Light. Note that some C/MRI Turnout control options use two output bits,
      the addressed one and the next one (see next paragraph), and that both output bits must be
      unassigned for successful creation of a new Turnout controlled by two output bits.</p>

      <p><a href="#top"><em><small>[Go to top of page]</small></em></a>
      </p>

      <h3 id="L001">Forming a JMRI System Name For a C/MRI Bit</h3>

      <p>System Names, which represent physical C/MRI hardware inputs or outputs, have four
      components:</p>

      <p style="margin-left:2em;"><strong>c[c]pn[nn]bbb</strong>
      </p>

      <p>where:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>c[c]</em> is the one or two character <strong>Connection prefix</strong> of the
        C/MRI Connection. If there is only a single C/MRI connection, this is typically the default
        of "C". If more than one C/MRI connections is defined, each will have a different
        connection prefix of one or two characters.</li>

        <li><em>p</em> is the <strong>Port type</strong> which specifies what type of JMRI object
        is to be associated with this C/MRI bit. Sensors are designated with a
        "<strong>S"</strong>, Turnouts with a "<strong>T"</strong>, and Lights with an
        "<strong>L</strong>".</li>

        <li><em>n[nn]</em> is the one, two, or three digit <strong>node address</strong>, a decimal
        value in the range of 0-127. While a node address of zero does not need to be inserted, it
        is preferred to include it for readability. Also, assigning node addresses greater than 9
        makes the System Name more readable.</li>

        <li>
          <em>bbb</em> is the <strong>bit number</strong>, the physical bit position in the C/MRI
          data stream, numbered in the range of 1-999 [for larger bit numbers, see <a href=
          "#L447">Alternate Form For System Names</a> below].
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>For example, C2S10024 is a JMRI Sensor, associated with the 24th input bit on Node 10 of
      C/MRI connection C2. CT8001 is a JMRI Turnout for the 1st output port on Node 8 of C/MRI
      connection C.</p>

      <p>When adding a C/MRI object to a JMRI table, only node address and bit number are entered.
      Connection prefix and port type are prefixed automatically.</p>

      <p>More information on System Names within JMRI can be found <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">here</a>.</p>

      <h4 id="L447">Alternate Numbering Scheme for C/MRI System Names</h4>

      <p>An alternate scheme for numbering in C/MRI System Names was developed to give user access
      to the full number of lines allowed by C/MRI hardware design. The main numbering system
      allows access to 999 input and output lines on each node. The C/MRI hardware design, however,
      supports many more bits for USIC and SUSIC nodes. Most JMRI users will never need this
      alternate scheme, and should use the main numbering scheme.</p>

      <p>The alternate numbering scheme is similar to the main numbering scheme, except the node
      address and bit number are separated by a "B", and both node address and bit number can range
      to any value supported by C/MRI. The format is thus:</p>

      <p style="margin-left:2em;"><strong>c[c]pn[nn]Bbbbb</strong>
      </p>

      <p>where "B" is the separator between the node number and the bit number, which can now go up
      to 2048 (depending on how the C/MRI node is defined to JMRI).</p>

      <p>For example, C2S10B24 is a C/MRI Sensor, for the 24th input bit on Node 10 on C/MRI
      connection C2. CT2B1009 is the a C/MRI Turnout for the 1009th output port on Node 2 on C/MRI
      connection C.</p>

      <p>Users may use either numbering scheme interchangeably for line numbers up to 999, but must
      use the alternate numbering scheme for line numbers greater than 999. For ease in
      communicating with other users, the main numbering scheme is recommended unless bits greater
      than 999 need to be addressed.</p>

      <h3 id="L484">Creating a Turnout Output</h3>

      <p>Turnouts and Lights are different methods of referring to C/MRI outputs from within JMRI.
      Each method has different control options. Always use 'Turnouts' for C/MRI outputs used to
      control Turnouts (track switches) and for C/MRI outputs used to operate signals.</p>

      <p>To create a turnout output, open the Turnout table by selecting
      <strong>Tools⇒Tables⇒Turnouts</strong> in the main PanelPro menu. Select "Add" and Select the
      name of the C/MRI connection from the pulldown list. [See also <a href=
      "../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">the Turnout Documentation</a>.]</p>

      <p><img alt="Turnout Table" src="images/turnouttable.png" width="1123" height="910">
      </p>

      <p>Creating a Turnout to refer to a specific C/MRI output bit on a specific node is called
      "assigning" that output bit. Each output bit may be assigned only once, i.e., two different
      Turnouts or Lights may not refer to the same C/MRI output bit on the same node. Enter the
      node address and the bit number in the <strong>Hardware Address</strong> field using the
      numbering scheme discussed <a href="#L001">above.</a> Do not enter the C/MRI Connection
      Prefix or the Port type ("T") as those will be prefixed automatically.</p>

      <p>Note that some C/MRI Turnout control options use two output bits, the addressed one and
      the next one (<a href="#L519">see next section</a>), and that both output bits must be
      unassigned for successful creation of a new Turnout controlled by two output bits.</p>

      <p>Turnout bits have two hardware states; THROWN for On and CLOSED for Off. These names are
      in place for historical reasons. When connected to actual switches, Closed can be "Normal" or
      the straight route and thrown can be interpreted as "Reverse" or the diverging route.</p>

      <p>When turnout bits are used on the C/MRI hardware to control signal LEDs or lamps, one
      turnout (output) bit would be assigned to the connection wire to the LED or lamp. Multi-color
      (aspect) signal heads would have one output port assigned to each active color LED. When
      defining signal heads, the defined turnout name for the color is used to associate the LED
      control wires. See the example on defining signal heads.</p>

      <p>Some types of C/MRI hardware may require turnouts to be defined for every bit on every
      active node. This is not, however, a JMRI requirement.</p>

      <h4 id="L519">Turnout Control Options</h4>

      <p>Turnouts (switches) may be controlled using one or two output bits. When a Turnout is
      created using the Add option in the Turnout Table, the user is asked whether the Turnout is
      to be controlled using one or two output bits and whether these should be "steady-state" or
      "pulsed." The way JMRI responds in each case for C/MRI turnouts is described in the following
      paragraphs.</p>

      <p class="noted">The way JMRI responds for turnouts defined with other hardware control
      systems may be different than for C/MRI. If you are not using C/MRI hardware or protocols,
      please refer to <a href="../index.shtml">the Hardware</a> help pages for your particular
      hardware or protocol.</p>

      <p><img alt="Turnout Control Bits" src="images/turnoutnumbits.png" width="665" height="247">
      </p>

      <p>With one bit control, THROWN and CLOSED states are controlled by the same bit (see below
      for how). With two bits, one bit is "On" for THROWN and the other bit is "On" for CLOSED. If
      both bits are "On" or "Off," nothing is sent to C/MRI. "Steady state" output means the C/MRI
      bit or bits will be sent once by JMRI. "Pulsed" means that an "On" will be sent when a change
      in state is requested and then an "Off" one second later, i.e. a pulse is sent. This behavior
      is particularly important to understand if you are programming a microcontroller to accept
      and respond to C/MRI transmissions.</p>

      <p><img alt="Turnout Output Type" src="images/turnoutoutputtype.png" width="603" height=
      "247">
      </p>

      <p>There are four possible combinations of number of bits and output selection:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>[1 bit, steady-state]</dt>

        <dd>
          <p class="dl">The one output bit is set "Off" for CLOSED (C/MRI manuals call this
          'normal') or "On" for THROWN ('reverse'). When setting the output bit, JMRI compares the
          <em>requested state</em> to the state indicated by the current value of the output bit.
          If these states are different, then the output bit is set and transmitted as indicated
          above. If these states are the same, that state is compared to the state indicated by
          <em>Turnout Feedback</em>. If the states are the same, no transmission take place since
          the Turnout is already in the requested state. If the states are different, the Turnout
          was probably changed by some means separate from JMRI.</p>

          <p class="dl">To ensure the Turnout is actually set to the requested state, the output
          bit is sent twice as follows:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>first, it is changed to match the state indicated by the Turnout Feedback,</li>

            <li>then one second later, it is changed again to match the requested state.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="dl">This approach guarantees that a requested change of state causes an actual
          move in the Turnout for those Turnout control devices that require a change in state to
          force the move.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>[1 bit, pulsed]</dt>

        <dd>
          <p class="dl">If "Use 1 bit" option is used with "Pulsed Output" control, the output bit
          is "Off" when nothing is happening. When CLOSED or THROWN is requested, this request is
          compared to the <em>known state</em> of the Turnout (which follows Turnout Feedback). If
          the known state indicates the Turnout is already in the requested state, nothing is done.
          If the known state is different from the requested state, then the bit is 'pulsed'. A
          'pulse' consists of the bit being turned "On" and transmitted. One second later, the bit
          is set "Off" and another transmission occurs.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>[2 bit, steady-state]</dt>

        <dd>
          <p class="dl">If "Use 2 bits" control is selected, the bit referenced in the Turnout
          system name and the next bit in sequence are used to control the Turnout. For example, if
          CT33 has two-output-bit control, the 33rd and 34th bits are used to control the Turnout.
          If two-output-bit control is selected, the user must select either 'steady state' or
          'pulsed' control. Steady state control should be selected for stall motor Turnouts, such
          as a Tortoise, if it is being controlled according to the recommendation in Chubb's C/MRI
          User's Manual, Version 3.0, page 3-12. With steady state control, for CLOSED, the first
          bit is set "Off" and the second bit is set "On"; for THROWN, the bits states are
          reversed, i.e., the first bit is set "On" and the second bit is set "Off".</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>[2 bit, pulsed]</dt>

        <dd>
          <p class="dl">If "Use 2 bits" control with "Pulse Output" control is requested, both bits
          are "Off" when nothing is happening. When CLOSED or THROWN is requested, this request is
          compared to the known state of the Turnout (which follows Turnout Feedback). If the known
          state indicates the Turnout is already in the requested state, nothing is done. If the
          known state is different from the requested state, then the first bit is pulsed if CLOSED
          is requested, or the second bit is pulsed if THROWN is requested. In either case, a
          'pulse' consists of the bit being turned "On" for one second, then returned to the "Off"
          position.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Note that Turnouts using two-output-bit control can only be created using the "Add" button
      in the Turnout Table.</p>

      <p>Finally, the "inverted" option can be selected. This controls how the C/MRI hardware
      implements the "On" and "Off" used in the description above. Normally (invert option not
      selected), "On" refers to a "1" to the hardware; with standard C/MRI hardware, this pulls the
      output pin down and allows it to sink current. "Off" the corresponds to a "0" to the
      hardware, turning the output pin off, and causing it to stop sinking current. When "invert"
      is selected, "On" results in a "0" sent to the hardware, and "Off" results in a "1" being
      sent. This causes the hardware to act with the opposite polarity.</p>

      <p>The C/MRI menu contains three tools which are used to manage nodes in a CMRInet network.
      Controlling the polling of nodes, displaying the operational states of configured nodes, and
      monitoring the data message traffic on the network are all functions available in the tool
      suite.</p>

      <p>Tools are found under a pulldown menu on the PanelPro and DecoderPro menu bar with the
      name of the C/MRI connection. In the example below, two C/MRI connections have been defined
      so two separate pulldown menus are listed.</p>

      <p>The CMRInet Manager is selected by selecting the <strong>C/MRI Network Manager</strong>
      menu item from the <strong>C/MRI</strong> menu.</p>

      <p>The CMRInet Manager displays the status of each configured node. Polling of individual
      nodes can be enabled or disabled by checking the <strong>Enabled</strong> check box for the

      <p>CMRInet protocol messages can be viewed by selecting <strong>C/MRI Monitor</strong> from
      the <strong>C/MRI</strong> menu in main PanelPro window. The monitor window decodes and
      formats the CMRInet data message to a readable form. The message traffic is displayed in real
      time with options selected by the user. The window has a scroll bar which will move the
      display up or down so messages which are off view can be seen.</p>

      <p>The data display may scroll by very quickly, depending upon the network line speed.
      Clicking on the <strong>Freeze Display</strong> button will stop the display from scrolling.
      Data messages will still be collected but not displayed until the <strong>Resume
      Display</strong> button is clicked. A text message tag can be inserted into the data display
      (and log file) by typing the text into the field next to the Add Message button. Click on the
      <strong>Add Message</strong> button to insert the text into the display.</p>

      <p>Data messages can be captured into a text file and saved for later viewing and analysis.
      Click on <strong>Choose Log File</strong>. A file create dialog window will open. Select a
      file name to save the data, then close the window. This action only creates the file for data
      capture. Click the <strong>Start Logging</strong> button to start the collection of data.

      <h4 id="L590">Interpreting Hexadecimal in C/MRI Monitor Output</h4>

      <p>The CMRI Monitor is a useful debugging tool for advanced JMRI users as it shows all data
      sent to and received from each connected CMRI node. Data is displayed in hexadecimal format
      (each digit representing 4 bits with hexadecimal values from 0 to F) so two digits represent
      a single byte (if the high order bits are all zero, then only a single digit is
      displayed).</p>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" target="_blank">Hexadecimal
      numbers</a> are used in displaying computer values based on assigning values in terms of
      powers of 2. Bits are numbered from 0 to 7 within a single byte where bit 7 is the leftmost
      and bit 0 is the rightmost bit displayed (if bits 4-7 are 0, only one hexadecimal digit will
      be shown).</p>

      <p><strong>Be aware:</strong> JMRI numbers C/MRI bits starting at 1 rather than 0 which may
      cause some confusion in interpreting the C/MRI Monitor output versus the C/MRI bit
      assignments. Some devices receiving C/MRI transmission from JMRI, such as the arduino, are
      programmed to assume bit numbering that starts at zero which is a further source of possible
      confusion.</p>

      <p>To help in interpreting C/MRI Monitor output, here are several examples showing what would
      be displayed with the corresponding bits set to 1. The examples represents a C/MRI node with
      24 bits (three bytes) of either input or output:</p>

      <p style="margin-left:2em;">C/MRI bits 8, 16, 24 set to 1 display as 80 80 80 (computer bits
      7, 15, 23)<br>
      C/MRI bits 7, 15, 23 set to 1 display as 40 40 40 (computer bits 6, 14, 22)<br>
      C/MRI bits 6, 14, 22 set to 1 display as 20 20 20 (computer bits 5, 13, 21)<br>
      C/MRI bits 5, 13, 21 set to 1 display as 10 10 10 (computer bits 4, 12, 20)</p>

      <p style="margin-left:2em;">C/MRI bits 4, 12, 20 set to 1 display as 8 8 8 (computer bits 3,
      11, 19)<br>
      C/MRI bits 3, 11, 19 set to 1 display as 4 4 4 (computer bits 2, 10, 18)<br>
      C/MRI bits 2, 10, 18 set to 1 display as 10 2 2 2 (computer bits 1, 9, 17) (an "escape"
      character is put in the string as a "10" if the first byte is a 2)<br>
      C/MRI bits 1, 9, 17 set to 1 display as 1 1 1 (computer bits 0, 8, 16)</p>

      <p>If multiple bits are set to 1 within the same byte, then output appears as in these
      examples:</p>

      <p style="margin-left:2em;">C/MRI bits 1, 2, 3, 4 set to 1 display as F (computer bits 0, 1,
      2, 3)<br>

      <h3 id="L597">CMRInet Network Metrics</h3>

      <p>Anytime the CMRInet is active, a network metrics collector is running in the background.
      The metrics collected are errors and performance or instrumentation data. CMRInet metrics can
      be viewed by selecting <strong>C/MRI Network Metrics</strong> from the <strong>C/MRI</strong>
      menu in main PanelPro window</p>

      <p><img alt="Network Metrics Menu" src="images/menu_Network_Metrics.png" width="702" height=
      "219">
      </p>

      <p>Each of the Error and Data Metric values can be reset to zero by clicking the appropriate
      <strong>Reset</strong> button. All of the metrics can be reset to zero by clicking the
      <strong>Reset All</strong> button. Metric data can be saved to a text file by clicking on the
      <strong>Save Metrics</strong> button. A file create dialog window will open, enter a file
      name for the metric data.</p>

      <h3 id="L609">Listing C/MRI Bit Assignments</h3>

      <p>For each node, you can view a summary list of C/MRI bits that are in use and those that
      are available.</p>

      <p>From the PanelPro main menu, select <strong>C/MRI⇒List Assignments</strong>, or
      <strong>C/MRI⇒Configure Nodes</strong> and then <strong>Select⇒Bit Assignments</strong> for
      each node, to bring up the Bit Assignments window. Click "Show Input Bits" or "Show Output
      Bits" depending on which you are interested in.</p>

      <p><img alt="List Assignments" src="images/menu_List_Assignments.png" width="672" height=
      "217">
      </p>

      <p>List Assignments is useful for checking that you have assigned the correct input and
      output bits to each Sensor (input) and Turnout or Light (outputs). Each line in the
      Assignment Table also contains an "address" column showing the node address and bit number as
      used in the JMRI system name for each C/MRI object. Printing blank assignment lists for each
      node provides a convenient paper form for use in setting up your input/output bit
      assignments. The Comment field information for the sensor, turnout, or light is also
      displayed.</p>

      <h2 id="L624">Diagnostics</h2>

      <p>Diagnostics are useful for checking the functioning of your C/MRI hardware. These
      automated procedures are controlled via a dialog available by selecting Run Diagnostics in
      the C/MRI menu. Some of the diagnostic tests require external hardware to operate. Chapter 6
      of Bruce Chubb's C/MRI User's Manual, Version 3.0, describes a test output card and loopback
      cable. These items connect to input and output ports on Classic nodes and provide hardware
      devices which are driven by the diagnostic test code. An integrated test card (IOTEST) from
      MRCS provides compatible test hardware support.</p>

      <p>Test message traffic can be viewed by opening the <strong>C/MRI Monitor</strong>.</p>

      <p><img alt="Diagnostics Menu" src="images/menu_diagnostics.png" width="672" height="217">
      </p>

      <p><img alt="Diagnostics Main" src="images/diagmain.png" width="698" height="612">
      </p>

      <p>The C/MRI Diagnostics window has five sections.</p>

      <p><strong>Test Node</strong> provides a popup menu for the selection of the node to be
      tested. The menu only displays the addresses of configured nodes for the connection. Node
      type and card assignment information for the selected node are displayed.</p>

      <p><strong>Test Suite</strong> has the test selection popup menu which lists available tests.
      The suggested equipment needed to run the test is also listed. The Halt polling button stops
      polling of nodes on the connection. Polling should be halted when running diagnostics so as
      not to interfere with the test sequences.</p>

      <p><strong>Test Set Up</strong> provides user input fields for data card selection and
      options for each test suite.</p>

      <p><strong>Status</strong> displays the progress of the running tests and any error messages
      related to the test sequences.</p>

      <p><strong>Test Control</strong> buttons displayed at the bottom of the window control the
      various test sequences and are specific to each test suite.</p>

      <h3 id="L625">Output Test</h3>

      <p>The Output Test writes a walking bit pattern to the output test card, lighting the LEDs
      corresponding to the bit pattern. The number of bits written is based upon card size (8, 24,
      32). The Output Card number is checked to be a valid defined output card. Observation delay
      is the number of milliseconds delay between each write. Checking the Invert box flips the
      state of the bits. This is useful for output cards which drive Common Anode (sinking)
      devices.</p>

      <p><img alt="Output test" src="images/diagoutputtest.png" width="698" height="612">
      </p>

      <h3 id="L626">Loopback Test</h3>

      <p>The Loopback Test uses a loopback cable connected to a card of outputs and a card of
      inputs. The test writes a data value pattern to each output port and reads the value from the
      corresponding input port. The input value is compared to the output value and displays any
      comparison errors. If a compare error occurs, the test is paused. Clicking the Continue
      button will write the next value to the output. Observation Delay and Filtering Delay adds
      time delay intervals to the write and read operations. Invert works the same as in the Output
      Test.</p>

      <p><img alt="Loopback" src="images/diagloopback.png" width="698" height="612">
      </p>

      <h3 id="L627">Send Commands</h3>

      <p>Send Commands provides raw CMRInet packet transmissions to the test node.</p>

      <p><strong>Initialize Node</strong> transmits an Initialize (I) message to the node. The node
      would then execute the onboard initialize code.</p>

      <p><strong>Poll Node</strong> transmits a poll message (P) to the node. The count of input
      bytes in the response is returned. If the node does not respond to the poll, a timeout error
      is reported.</p>

      <p><strong>Write Bytes</strong> transmits (T) the user entered byte string to the output card
      number. The bytes need to be entered as hexadecimal values separated by a space. The maximum
      number of bytes written is the defined by size of the card (1, 3, 4). Invert works the same
      as in the Output Test.</p>

      <h2 id="L632">CMRInet Network Connections</h2>

      <p>Using USB-serial adapters</p>

      <p>Most C/MRI systems use RS-422/485 electrical signals to communicate between the nodes and
      the computer. There are several ways to generate them:</p>

      <p style="margin-left:2em;">1. If your computer has a built-in serial port (RS-232
      connection), you can use an RS-232 to RS-422/485 convertor. There's one you can build as part
      of the C/MRI system, or you can buy a commercial one.</p>

      <p style="margin-left:2em;">2. If your computer has a USB port, you can buy a commercial USB
      to RS-422/485 adapter and use that.</p>

      <p style="margin-left:2em;">3. If your computer has a USB port and you have a RS232 to
      RS-422/485 convertor, you can install a USB-to-RS232 adapter (sometimes called a
      "USB-to-serial converter"), then connect the RS232 output of that to the RS232 input of the
      RS232 to RS-422/485 convertor.</p>

      <p style="margin-left:2em;">Note that if you're using the Chubb RS232-to-RS-422/485
      converter, some USB-to-RS232 adapters will require that you connect certain RS232 control
      leads that are not handled by the Chubb interface board:</p>

      <p style="margin-left:2em;">o DSR - DTR (pins 4 & 6 on the DB9 connector)o RTS - CTS (pins 7
      & 8 on the DB9 connector)</p>

      <p style="margin-left:0em">In all cases, the communications line will end up appearing as a
      serial port on your computer. In Windows, this is a COM port, in other computers it's a named
      serial device. You will need to select the proper one when configuring JMRI. If no serial
      devices appear in the selection popup menu, you may not have any operating system serial
      device drivers installed.</p>

      <h3 id="L652">Using An Ethernet Network Connection</h3>

      <p>JMRI allows you to connect to C/MRI nodes through a network connection. JMRI communicates
      via the TCP/IP protocol across a network to a network-to-serial adapter, which converts the
      network connection to a serial stream that then goes through a RS-422/485 convertor to the
      C/MRI node(s).</p>

      <p>The network-to-serial adapter is sometimes called a "terminal server". It's also sometimes
      called a "Lantronix box" after an early manufacturer of these, though they're now available
      from multiple sources. The adapter has to be configured with the correct serial parameters
      for your C/MRI system, including the proper baud rate and 8-data-bits, no parity. You will
      probably need a RS232-to-RS-422/485 adapter on the output of the network adapter.</p>

      <p>Some hobbyists have also built C/MRI nodes that have native Ethernet connections. JMRI
      communicates with them via a direct TCP/IP connection using the C/MRI protocol, but in this
      case there's no need for a RS-422/485 convertor.</p>

      <p>To configure JMRI to use a network connection, go to the Preferences screen, Connections
      tab. After selecting C/MRI for the System Manufacturer, select "Network Interface" for the
      System Connection. Then enter the IP address (or node name, if it has one) of your
      network-to-serial adapter in the IP Address / Host Name field. If it uses a non-standard port
      number, check the Additional Configuration Settings box and enter the port number. Click Save
      and restart the program.</p>

      <p><a href="#top"><em><small>[Go to top of page]</small></em></a>
      </p>

      <h3 id="L662">Running JMRI when disconnected from your C/MRI system</h3>

      <p>JMRI continually polls the C/MRI hardware for status changes. If one or more C/MRI nodes
      are not responding, eventually their inputs (Sensors) are set to the UNKNOWN state to
      indicate that JMRI has lost contact with those devices on the layout.</p>

      <p>Although this is the right thing to do when you're really connected to the hardware and
      trying to operate the layout, it can get in the way if you're running JMRI without your
      layout connection. You might want to do this, for example, to work on your panels while away
      from the layout, or while the layout needs to be powered off for some reason.</p>

      <p>To accommodate using JMRI without an active layout connection, in the JMRI 2.3.2 release a
      "C/MRI Simulator" connection was made available in the Preferences.</p>

      <p>Please note that this is only meant for users who already have a working C/MRI connection
      already configured. Please do not try to use the C/MRI simulator before configuring a valid
      connection to C/MRI hardware, as it will not work.</p>

      <p>Once you have your C/MRI connection configured, when your hardware is not available you
      can just go to the JMRI Preferences, select "C/MRI Simulator", save Preferences, quit and
      restart. Don't change any other settings!</p>

      <p>When the C/MRI hardware is again available, go the JMRI Preferences, select "C/MRI
      Serial", save Preferences, quit and restart.</p>

      <h2 id="L676">PanelPro Signaling Example Using C/MRI</h2>

      <p>The following is an example of what is needed to create a simple ABS signaling system
      using an SMINI node and Control Panel Editor (CPE) in PanelPro. The SMINI will be set to node
      address 15.</p>

      <p>The focus of the example is to show the relationship between the input and output ports
      (bits) on the SMINI and the logical connection to the various JMRI device tables. Only the
      device table information will be defined. The required Logix and Conditionals will not be
      described.</p>

      <p>The section to be signaled is a classic mainline/passing siding triad. The operating
      scheme is assumed to be Automatic Block System (ABS), with the trains given written authority
      to occupy the track segments and operate the switches if needed. Block occupancy and turnout
      position determine signal aspects. All Stop aspects are Absolute.</p>

      <p>Signals, which control the entrance and exit to the siding, will display only Yellow
      (Approach) and Red (Stop) as it is assumed these are low speed routes.</p>

      <p><img alt="Rucker section" src="images/example-ruckersection.png" width="627" height="399">
      </p>

      <p>Sensors are the block occupancy detectors and two fascia toggle switches controlling the
      turnouts. The detectors will present an Active state when a block is occupied, and Inactive
      when a block is vacant. The switch controls, will present Inactive for the turnout in Normal,
      and Active if the turnout is Reverse.</p>

      <p>Inputs are assigned to Card 2, ports A0 through B0. The output of block detector BLK78 is
      connected to SMINI Node 15, Sensor input, Card 2, port A0. The comment field is used to
      document the physical SMINI port and a description of the track section.</p>

      <p>By referring to the port names printed on the SMINI circuit board, the connection is path
      is fully defined. User Names are used when writing Logix statements. A consistent naming
      scheme should be adopted for creating easy references in the Logix Conditionals. One should
      be able to look at a User Name and immediately identify what type of device is connected to
      the port.</p>

      <p>The Sensor table is a live view of the state of the port. For Sensors, applying a signal
      ground to the port will cause the State to change from Inactive to Active. This technique is
      a great way to verify if the node is communicating with the Master and that the port
      assignments match the actual connected device.</p>

      <p><img alt="Sensor Table" src="images/example-sensortable.png" width="1153" height="449">
      </p>

      <p>Outputs are defined in the Turnout table. As described earlier, the name "turnout" is
      historical. Again, just think of turnouts as the output ports. Output states are Closed for
      Off, and Thrown for On. If the port is connected to an actual turnout, Closed would normally
      be "Normal" and Thrown would be "Reverse". The "Cmd" column displays the live state of the
      port. Clicking on the Cmd button will toggle the turnout from Closed to Thrown. This
      capability can be used to test connections and proper operation of output devices.</p>

      <p><img alt="Turnout Table" src="images/example-turnouttable.png" width="1158" height="970">
      </p>

      <p>There are two output ports assigned to turnout controller bits. The turnout control bits
      are assigned to Card 0, ports A0 through C7, and Card 1 port A0. The turnout motor control
      bit for SW35 is connected to SMINI Node 15, Turnout output, Card 0, port A0.</p>

      <p>Six signal masts are required for signaling. Two are dual head with an upper and lower
      head. LED's are assumed to be the lamps used for aspect illumination. One output bit is
      required for each color. All LED commons are tied together. Signal mast 80LA is a single head
      signal.</p>

      <p>There are three LEDs in the head; Green, Yellow, and Red. Each wire attached to a color
      LED must be connected to an output port. The green LED for signal 80LA (SG80LA-G) is
      connected to SMINI node 15, turnout, bit 10, Card 0, port B1.</p>
