      <h1>Hardware Support: Chubb C/MRI</h1>

      <h2>Signals with C/MRI</h2>

      <p>For model signals with separate Red/Yellow/Green diodes,
      the situation is simple: Connect each one to a separate
      output with the proper polarity, have PanelPro drive those
      three outputs, and it will Just Work. The "Triple Output"
      type of Signal handles this type of wiring.</p>

      <p>For model signals with just Red and Green diodes, there
      are two ways of wiring them:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The diodes have one common connection, plus one lead
        for powering each diode. This is the so-called "three lead"
        type. Note that there are still just two diodes here, but
        there are three leads to wire.</li>

        <li>The diodes are wired back to back. This is the
        so-called "two lead" type</li>
      </ol>

      <p>In both cases you wire these to two C/MRI outputs. There
      are a couple of extra resistors, and perhaps an external
      power supply involved, so that when one of the C/MRI outputs
      is activated, power is applied to one diode and it lights,
      and when the other is activated the other diode gets power.
      That makes Red and Green. The "Double Output" Signal type
      handles this.</p>

      <p>To get Yellow, you have to power both LEDs. This is easy
      with wiring (1.) above; the program just activates both of
      the outputs, both LEDs make light, and the Red and Green
      combine to make Yellow.</p>

      <p>With wiring 2., you can't simultaneously light both LEDs,
      since current can't flow in two directions at the same time.
      But "at the same time" is the key; just alternate the
      direction of the current Very Fast, too fast for the eye to
      see, and the colors will merge into Yellow. There are two
      ways to do this:</p>

      <p>2.A) Use an external circuit. There's a signal driver
      board to do this what connects between the C/MRI outputs and
      the LED leads. When it detects that _both_ outputs are on, it
      rapidly alternates the voltage to the LEDs, making yellow.
      This circuit can be used with any C/MRI system type, and you
      don't have to tell PanelPro anything to make it work.</p>

      "images/CMRIConfigNodesSMINI.png" alt="Config Pane" align=
      "right" height="202" width="218"></a> 2.B) Use support built
      into the SMINI card. An SMINI card can be configured to do a
      similar thing. When the SMINI detects the two outputs are on,
      it alternates the voltage. To configure this, you have to go
      to the PanelPro Preferences, click on "Configure C/MRI nodes"
      (or select it from the <strong>CMRI</strong> menu), select an
      SMINI to configure, and click on one of the little
      check-boxes to configure a specific output as "two lead
      oscillating signal". Click "Edit Node" to update, then close
      that panel, click "Save" and restart the program. Once this
      is done, a "Double Turnout" signal type will also generate
      yellow signals on those outputs.</p>
