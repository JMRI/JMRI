      <h1>Hardware Support: JMRIClient Connection</h1>

      <p>The JMRIClient Connection provides a method of remotely
      connecting one JMRI program to another. It can be used to
      build a Panel on one computer, which is connected to the
      layout directly, but actually operate the Panel on a computer
      without a physical connection to the layout.</p>

      <p>The JMRIClient Connection can also be used to share
      information between two adjacent operators without completely
      replicating the information on each computer. This
      configuration is particularly useful on modular layouts where
      multiple module builders are involved.</p><a name=
      "connecting" id="connecting"></a>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <h3>The JMRI Simple Server</h3>

      <p>"Simple" in this case actually refers to the protocol, not
      the server itself. It uses pretty simple commands that
      include the device name (except for the power command) to
      send information bi-directionally. The protocol itself limits
      the actions that can be taken, so it will eventually be
      replaced with a more complete (and complicated) protocol.</p>

      <p>The server currently supports throwing Turnouts, turning
      Lights on and off, Sensor feedback, Reporter feedback and
      controlling Power. You can start the server through a
      configuration action. It uses TCP port 2048. The port is set
      in a Preference, so you can change it if needed.</p>

      <h3>The JMRIClient</h3>

      <p>The JMRIClient works with the server to allow remote
      control of turnouts, lights, and power, and remote feedback
      from sensors and reporters.</p>

      <p>To configure the JMRIClient, you can select the "JMRI
      (Network)" option in the systems manufacturer list. Under
      this option is "JMRI Network Connection". You may have
      multiple "JMRI Network Connection" interfaces configured.</p>

      <p>The client currently uses the system prefix to determine
      what to send to the server. If your server has a connection
      with a prefix "XYZ", you need to configure your client with
      the prefix "XYZ" to be able to access the named devices on
      the server.</p>

      <p>If you have more than one system connected to the server,
      you need to configure more than one client connection. NOTE:
      There currently is a warning when you configure more than one
      client, because all of the port information is the same. You
      can safely ignore this for a network connection.</p>

      <p>Once the client has sent a request to the server about an
      object, any state changes are shown on both the client and
      the server.</p>

      <h2>Operational Examples</h2>

      <h3>Simple Connection Replication</h3>

      <p>The simplest operational use of the JMRIClient and the
      simple server is having one computer connected directly to
      the layout (the server computer) and a second computer ( the
      client computer) connected to the first via a computer
      network where you would like to operate a panel.</p>

      <p>For this example, we will assume the server computer has a
      LocoNet connection with the prefix 'L'.</p>

      <p>On the server computer, open the Preferences, and select
      the Start Up group. click the "Add &#9662;" button, select
      "Perform action..." and select "Start JMRI Simple Server"
      from the list of options. Save the preferences and restart
      the program.</p>

      <p><img src="images/simpleserver-autostart.png" alt=
      "Action added to automatically start the JMRI SimpleServer"
      width="452" height="213"></p>

      <p>On the client machine, add a "JMRI (Network)" connection.
      Change the system connection prefix to "L". and set the IP
      address to the IP address of the server. Save the preferences
      and restart the program.</p>

      <p><img src="images/jmriclient-base-configuration.png" alt=
      "JMRIClient Configuration screen (configured for LocoNet with a server on localhost)"
      width="452" height="213"></p>

      <p>Once both computers have restarted JMRI, you will be able
      to load a panel file on the client computer which was created
      on the server computer.</p>

      <p>Each machine will have its own set of tables and (
      optionally) panel files loaded, if the client causes an
      action, information will be transferred to the server, and
      the server will trigger an action on the layout. If an action
      occurs on the server, the server will transmit an indication
      of the action to the client if the client has indicated it is
      interested in the device.</p>

      <h3>Operational Notes</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>If you have any Logix or Routes, you probably only want
        those running on one of the two machines.</li>

        <li>In order for any information about a
        light/turnout/sensor to be returned to the client, it must
        be defined on the client.</li>

        <li>
          <p>Invert is defined for both sensors and turnouts. If
          invert is enabled on both the client and server, the
          actual device will have normal behavior when the client
          uses it.</p>

          <p>This one is interesting, because it can be a bug or
          not a bug depending on your use case.</p>

          <p>If your use case is that both the client and server
          machines have panels running, then you might consider
          this a bug. There are two work arounds in this case 1)
          load a panel without inverted set on the client or 2) Run
          the panel on the server through a second instance of JMRI
          which is acting as a client to the first instance.</p>

          <p>If your use case is that the server just provides
          connections, but doesn't do any logic, then this is not a
          bug.</p>
