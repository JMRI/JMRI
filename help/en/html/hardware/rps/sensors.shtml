<h1> 
JMRI Hardware Guide: RPS Sensors
</h1>

<em>Please note that JMRI's RPS support is being rapidly improved.
This page refers to most recent JMRI test version.  If you're using
an RPS system, you should update to new test versions as they 
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/download/index.shtml">are announced</a>.</em>

<p>
The 
<a href="http://www.proto87.com/RPS-MR-position-detection-system.html">RPS System</a>
provides absolute location of RPS-equipped rolling stock.
<P>
JMRI can use that to set JMRI 
<a href="../../tools/Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a>
when a RPS transmitter is in a specific area, which can in turn be used to control other
JMRI functions such as 
<a href="../../tools/Signals.shtml">signals</a>, 
<a href="../../tools/Routes.shtml">Routes</a> and 
<a href="../../tools/Logix.shtml">Logix</a>.

<p>
An RPS sensor is associated with an area bounded by a series of
points and the lines between them.

<h2>Defining a Sensor</h2>
There are two ways to create an RPS Sensor and define the 
area on the layout that it covers.

<h3>By Coordinates</h3>

You can enter a series of coordinates that list the corners 
of the region to be covered.  For example, the points
defining a square one unit on a side are:
<code><pre>
 (0,0,0)
 (1,0,0)
 (1,1,0)
 (0,1,0)
</pre></code>
If you use the Sensor Table's "Add..." button
to create a sensor with the system name
<code><pre>
  RS(0,0,0);(1,0,0);(1,1,0);(0,1,0)
</pre></code>
you'll get an RPS Sensor that shows "ACTIVE" when a 
transmitter is present in that area, and "INACTIVE" otherwise.
<p>
The "R" means the RPS system, "S" means you're defining a Sensor,
and the rest of the name defines the coordinates of the corners
of the region to include in the sensor.
Each corner is specified by its X, Y and Z values, all grouped
together with parantheses.  The corners should be separated by
semicolons; see the example above.

<p>
Once you've defined your sensor, you can use the 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/trackingpanel/RpsTrackingFrame.shtml">tracking display</a>
to see if it's in the right place on your layout.

<h3>Using the Tracking Tool</h3>
(To be written, for now see the
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/trackingpanel/RpsTrackingFrame.shtml">tracking display help page</a>.)
