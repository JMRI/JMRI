      <h1>Hardware Support: NAC Services RPS Sensors</h1><em>Please
      note that JMRI's RPS support is being rapidly improved. This
      page refers to most recent JMRI test version. If you're using
      an RPS system, you should update to new test versions as they
      <a href="http://jmri.org/download/index.shtml">are
      announced</a>.</em>

      <p>The <a href=
      "http://www.proto87.com/model-trains-DCC-decoders.html">RPS
      System</a> provides an absolute location of RPS-equipped
      rolling stock.</p>

      <p>JMRI can use that to set <a href=
      "../../tools/Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a> when a RPS
      transmitter is in a specific area, which can in turn be used
      to control other JMRI functions such as <a href=
      "../../tools/Signals.shtml">Signals</a>, <a href=
      "../../tools/Routes.shtml">Routes</a> and <a href=
      "../../tools/Logix.shtml">Logix</a>. <a name="connecting" id=
      "connecting"></a></p>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <h3>Defining a Sensor</h3>

      <p>An RPS Sensor is associated with an area bounded by a
      series of points and the lines between those points.<br>
      There are two ways to create an RPS Sensor and define the
      area on the layout that it covers.</p>

      <h4>By Coordinates</h4>You can enter a series of coordinates
      that list the corners of the region to be covered. For
      example, the points defining a square one unit on a side are:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
 (0,0,0)
 (1,0,0)
 (1,1,0)
 (0,1,0)
</pre>If you use the Sensor Table's "Add..." button to create a
Sensor with the System Name
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
  RS(0,0,0);(1,0,0);(1,1,0);(0,1,0)
</pre>you'll get an RPS Sensor that shows "ACTIVE" when a
Transmitter is present in that area, and "INACTIVE" otherwise.

      <p>The "R" means the RPS system, "S" means you're defining a
      Sensor, and the rest of the name defines the coordinates of
      the corners of the region to include in the Sensor. Each
      corner is specified by its X, Y and Z values, all grouped
      together with parentheses. The corners should be separated by
      semicolons; see the example above.</p>

      <p>Once you've defined your Sensor, you can use the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/trackingpanel/RpsTrackingFrame.shtml">
      Tracking display</a> to see if it's in the right place on
      your layout.</p>

      <h4>Using the Tracking Tool</h4>(To be written, for now see
      the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/trackingpanel/RpsTrackingFrame.shtml">
      Tracking display help page</a>.) <a name="documentation" id=
      "documentation"></a>
