      <h1>Hardware Support: NAC Services RPS</h1>

      <p><em>Please note that JMRI's RPS support is being rapidly
      improved. This page refers to most recent JMRI test version.
      If you're using an RPS system, you should update to new test
      versions as they <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/download/index.shtml">are
      announced</a>.</em></p>

      <p>The <a href=
      "http://www.proto87.com/model-trains-DCC-decoders.html">RPS
      System</a> allows you to locate the exact position of
      locomotives and other rolling stock that have been equipped
      with transmitter decoders. The system makes up to 10
      measurements per second and each reading is accurate to much
      better than an inch, which makes many imaginative uses
      possible. <a name="hardware" id="hardware"></a></p>

      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <h3>DCC Systems</h3>

      <p>The RPS system works in conjunction which your DCC system
      to control when the RPS transmitters are activated. You
      therefore need a working connection between your DCC system
      and JMRI to use RPS.</p>

      <p>At the present time, RPS is supported with DCC systems
      from:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Digitrax</li>

        <li>Lenz</li>

        <li>NCE</li>
      </ul>Others may work, and we're interested in making them
      work, but they haven't been tested in combination with RPS
      yet. <a name="connecting" id="connecting"></a>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <p>First, get your DCC system working and connected to JMRI.
      As a good test of the connection, you should be able to turn
      your layout power on and off from the JMRI Power Control in
      the Tools menu.</p>

      <h3>Wiring</h3>

      <p>Next set up the RPS hardware following the RPS
      instructions. You may want to only install a few (but a
      minimum of three) receivers while you're first getting the
      system working.</p>

      <p>Next, connect your computer to the RPS using either a USB
      connection or an RS232 cable from a serial port. If you use
      an RS232 cable, note that it should be a "straight-through"
      or "modem" cable, <i>not</i> a "crossover" or "null-modem"
      cable.</p>

      <h3>Settings</h3><img src="images/NAC_RPSConnection.png"
      width="431" height="200" align="right" alt=
      "RPS Connection pane">

      <p>To configure RPS in JMRI:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start your JMRI-based program: DecoderPro, PanelPro,
        etc.</li>

        <li>Go to the Connections tab of the JMRI Preferences. This
        opens automatically the first time the application is run,
        or you can select it from the "Edit" menu.</li>

        <li>Your DCC connection should already be configured in the
        top section, as you tested it three steps back.</li>

        <li>Click on the "+" sign to the right of your current
        Connection to open a new Connections pane.</li>

        <li>Select "NAC Services" from the list as the "System
        Manufacturer".</li>

        <li>Select "RPS Base Station" as the "System
        Connection".</li>

        <li>In the associated port selection box under Settings,
        pick the name of the serial port that you have connected to
        the RPS system.</li>

        <li>The baud rate will show a fixed value of 115,200
        baud.</li>

        <li>As a temporary measure during development of the
        system, there's a "Protocol" option to select.<br>
        The valid choices are "Version 1" and "Version 2"; your
        hardware determines which to use. Most current RPS systems
        use "Version 2". <em>This selection will eventually be
        automated.</em></li>

        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the
        program to quit, click "Yes".</li>

        <li>Restart the program. It should come up saying it's
        connected to your DCC system, and just below that saying
        it's connected to the RPS Base Station on the proper
        port.</li>

        <li>Next, you have to enter alignment information. From the
        RPS menu, select "<a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/aligntable/AlignTableFrame.shtml">Receiver
        Control</a>". This will open a new window.</li>

        <li>In the middle of that window, enter the number of
        highest-numbered receiver you've got. For example, if you
        have three receivers numbered 2, 3 and 6, enter 6 in the
        field.<br>
        Press the "Set" button next to that field.</li>

        <li>In the table at the top, enter the X, Y and Z position
        of each of your receivers. If you don't have a receiver
        with a particular number, leave that row blank. For now,
        just enter approximate values.</li>

        <li>Check the boxes next to each receiver you have hooked
        up, and make sure that there's no box checked next for
        receiver numbers that are not yet connected.</li>

        <li>Click the "Set Defaults" button to save these positions
        as default values. They'll appear again when you next start
        the program.</li>
      </ul>At this point, your RPS system is ready to go.

      <p>To have your RPS system start measuring positions, you
      have to tell it to poll the Locomotives in which you've
      installed RPS transmitters.<br>
      To do this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Open "<a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/swing/polling/PollTableFrame.shtml">RPS
        Polling Control</a>" from the RPS menu</li>

        <li>You should see all of the Locomotives in your
        Roster</li>

        <li>Check the box under "Poll" for each Locomotive in which
        an RPS Transmitter is installed</li>

        <li>Check the "poll" box to start making measurements</li>

        <li>Click "Store New Default Values" to store these
        settings so they'll be used the next time you start
        JMRI.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To see that the system is working, open the "<a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/swing/debugger/DebuggerFrame.shtml">Debugger
      Window</a>" from the RPS menu. You should see time readings
      coming in and being converted to positions. You can also
      check the communications with the unit by opening the "RPS
      Monitor" from the RPS menu. <a name="tools" id=
      "tools"></a></p>
