<h1> 
JMRI: Marklin Command Station 2
</h1>
JMRI can connect to a Marklin Command Station 2 using the built in ethernet interface.<br>
It is possible for multiple PCs to connect to the CS2 using IP/UDP.
<p>
The CS2 uses its own CAN BUS protocol running over UDP, responses from the CS2 are sent out as a broadcast message 
and therefore the PCs connecting to the CS2 must be in the same IP subnet otherwise the reply messages will not get seen.
<p>
This implementation of the CS2 CAN protocol was developed and tested on firmware version 2.
<b>
This interface is still under development if you find any issues then please raise a issue on the yahoo group</b>
<p>
To configure the connection:
<ul>
<li>Open the JMRI "Preferences" under the "Edit" menu,
<li>Select "MARKLIN" as the manufacuturer, then the connection type is Command Station 2,
<li>Enter in the address assigned to the CS2.
<li>Click "Save".
</ul>

<p>
Turnouts, Sensors, Throttle and power support is available for 
a JMRI-connected CS2 unit.
<p>
Throttle support includes the ability to select a specific protocol (Marklin, DCC & mfx)
<p>

Consisting, and Programming are not yet support.
<p>
Support for the Marklin CS2 was first available in 
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/releasenotes/jmri3.1.1.shtml">JMRI 3.1.1</a>.
