      <h1>Hardware Support: M&auml;rklin </h1>
      JMRI supports two M&auml;rklin command stations:
      the <a href="#cs2">Command Station 2 (CS2)</a> and
      the <a href="#cdb">CdB CC-Schnitte 2</a>.

      <h2 id="cs2">Command Station 2 (CS2)</h2>

      <p>JMRI can connect to a M&auml;rklin Command Station 2 using the built in Ethernet interface.<br>
      It is possible for multiple PCs to connect to a CS2 using UDP/IP or TCP/IP.</p>

      <p>The CS2 uses its own CAN BUS protocol running over the network.
      When using the UDP protocol, responses from the CS2 are sent
      out as a broadcast message and therefore the PCs connecting to the CS2 must be in the same IP
      subnet otherwise the reply messages will not get seen.
      The TCP protocol connection does not have this limitation.</p>

      <p>This implementation of the CS2 CAN protocol was developed and tested on CS2 firmware
      version 2.</p>

      <p>Support for the M&auml;rklin CS2 was first available in <a href=
      "https://www.jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri3.1.1.shtml">JMRI 3.1.1</a>.
      TCP protocol was added in 
      <a href="https://www.jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri5.11.5.shtml">JMRI 5.11.5</a></p>

      <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
      <strong>This interface is still under development; if you find any issues then please raise a
      issue on the <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRI users</a> mailing list.</strong>
      <p>Consisting, and Programming are not yet supported.</p>

      <h3 id="connecting">Connecting</h3>

      <p>To configure the connection:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the JMRI "Preferences" under the "Edit" menu,</li>

        <li>Select "MARKLIN" as the manufacturer, and Command Station 2 as the Connection
        type with either TCP (recommended) or UDP protocol.</li>

        <li>Enter in the address assigned to the CS2.</li>

        <li>Click "Save".</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Turnouts, Sensors, Throttle and power support is available for a JMRI-connected CS2
      unit.</p>

      <p>Throttle support includes the ability to select a specific protocol (M&auml;rklin, DCC & mfx)

      Enter a message as a hex string, starting with the prefix 0x e.g. <code>0x4467</code>. Press
      [Send] and wait for a reply from the CS2 connection to appear in the Reply field.


      <h2 id="cdb">CdB CC-Schnitte 2</h2>

      <p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.5.shtml">JMRI 5.3.5</a></span>
      JMRI can connect using a CC-Schnitte USB interface.</p>

      <p>The CC-Schnitte is a third party USB interface for the Marklin CAN Bus.
      It is usually directly attached to the 60113 Digital Connector Box,
      with the MobileStation 2 attached to the second port.
      In the Marklin system, the Connector Box receives commands from devices attached to the CAN Bus.
      It acts as a mini booster, but also translates them into a proper DCC/mm2/mfx signal.
      CC-Schnitte combines with the Connector Box in a fashion similar as the
      already supported CentralStation 2.
