      <h1>Hardware Support: M&auml;rklin </h1>
      JMRI supports two M&auml;rklin command stations:
      the <a href="#cs2">Command Station 2 (CS2)</a> and
      the <a href="#cdb">CdB CC-Schnitte 2</a>.

      <h2 id="cs2">Command Station 2 (CS2)</h2>

      <p>JMRI can connect to a M&auml;rklin Command Station 2 using the built in Ethernet interface.<br>
      It is possible for multiple PCs to connect to a CS2 using IP/UDP.</p>

      <p>The CS2 uses its own CAN BUS protocol running over UDP; responses from the CS2 are sent
      out as a broadcast message and therefore the PCs connecting to the CS2 must be in the same IP
      subnet otherwise the reply messages will not get seen.</p>

      <p>This implementation of the CS2 CAN protocol was developed and tested on CS2 firmware
      version 2.</p>

      <p>Support for the M&auml;rklin CS2 was first available in <a href=
      "https://www.jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri3.1.1.shtml">JMRI 3.1.1</a>.</p>

      issue on the <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRI users</a> mailing list.</strong>
      <p>Consisting, and Programming are not yet supported.</p>

      <h3 id="connecting">Connecting</h3>

      <p>To configure the connection:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the JMRI "Preferences" under the "Edit" menu,</li>

        <li>Select "MARKLIN" as the manufacturer, and Command Station 2 as the Connection
        type,</li>

        <li>Enter in the address assigned to the CS2.</li>

        <li>Click "Save".</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Turnouts, Sensors, Throttle and power support is available for a JMRI-connected CS2
      unit.</p>

      <p>Throttle support includes the ability to select a specific protocol (M&auml;rklin, DCC & mfx)

      Enter a message as a hex string, starting with the prefix 0x e.g. <code>0x4467</code>. Press
      [Send] and wait for a reply from the CS2 connection to appear in the Reply field.


      <h2 id="cdb">CdB CC-Schnitte 2</h2>

      <p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.5.shtml">JMRI 5.3.5</a></span>
      JMRI can connect using a CC-Schnitte USB interface.</p>

      <p>The CC-Schnitte is a third party USB interface for the Marklin CAN Bus.
      It is usually directly attached to the 60113 Digital Connector Box,
      with the MobileStation 2 attached to the second port.
      In the Marklin system, the Connector Box receives commands from devices attached to the CAN Bus.
      It acts as a mini booster, but also translates them into a proper DCC/mm2/mfx signal.
      CC-Schnitte combines with the Connector Box in a fashion similar as the
      already supported CentralStation 2.
