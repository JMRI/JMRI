<h1> 
JMRI: Powerline System Names
</h1>

Individual inputs (Sensors) and outputs (Turnouts and Lights)
in JMRI are accessed via names.  
For information on the general scheme, please see
the 
<a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">naming page</a>
in the
<a href="../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical documentation</a>.

<h2>X10</h2>

X10 devices are addressed via a "House Code" of A through P, 
and a "Device Code" of 1 through 16.

<p>
Outputs (Lights or Turnouts) in each House Code 
are numbered with their 
Device Code, e.g. 
<ul>
<li>PTA1 is a JMRI Turnout that talks to device 1 on housecode A
<li>PTB3 is a Turnout for device 3 on housecode B
<li>PLP16 is a JMRI Light for device 16 on housecode P
</ul>

<p>
If an output is called as a Turnout (name starts with PT-), you only get On and Off
as output options.

<p>
An output that is used as a Light (name starts with PL-) 
will take variable intensities.
However, some physical X10 devices may not support dimming.

<p>
Inputs (Sensors) are identified by the house code and device number
that was reported by some other X10 device like a motion sensor or
light control pad.<br />
NOTE: due to a large number of false codes due to other X10 users,
sensors are not automatically generated.
They must be manually entered in the Sensor Table by the user.

<p>
JMRI configures the adapter to use House Code "A" now.
We'll eventually make that configurable, but for now
that means that input messages will only be received
from devices set to House Code A, so only sensors "PSA1" through "PSA16"
will work.
<br />
(Early versions of JMRI X10 support used an all-numeric address
like PT12, with no House Code letters; this is no longer available,
because it caused way too much confusion)

<h2>Insteon</h2>

Insteon adapters are labelled with a three-part number that looks
like "01.2A.B4". These are just random
strings as far as the user and the program is concerned, and
we don't make any effort to subdivide them.  You should
enter these exactly as they appear on the device you 
want to address. Do not delete or add leading zeros, etc.

<p>
For example, if the device is labelled "01.2A.B4",
the corresponding Light system name is "PL01.2A.B4".
