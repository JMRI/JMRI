      <h1>Hardware Support: RailDriver Throttle</h1>

      <h2 id="hardware">Supported Hardware</h2>

      <p>JMRI allows you to use a <a href="http://raildriver.com/">RailDriver</a> from <a href=
      "http://www.piengineering.com/">PI Engineering</a> as a Hardware Throttle to run Locomotives
      with your DCC system.</p>

      <h2 id="connecting">Connecting</h2>

      <h3>Wiring</h3>

      <p>First, connect your computer to your DCC system and make sure that the regular <a href=
      "../../tools/throttle/ThrottleMain.shtml">JMRI Throttles</a> are working fine (Unless you do
      this first, debugging possible problems connecting the RailDriver is very difficult.)</p>

      <p>Next, plug the RailDriver into a USB port on your computer while your JMRI application
      (PanelPro or DecoderPro) isn't running.</p>

      <h3>Configure OS</h3>

      <h4>Linux</h4>
      Out of the box Ubuntu classifies HID devices as belonging to root. You can override this rule
      by creating your own under /etc/udev/rules.d:

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/99-myhid.rules
</pre>
      <p>Make the content of this file as below (using your own discovered hex values for idVendor
      and idProduct): (note: RailDriver: 0x05F3 / 0x00D2)</p>

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        # My HID device
        ATTRS{idProduct}=="00D2", ATTRS{idVendor}=="05F3", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
</pre>
      <p>Save and exit from root, then unplug and replug your device. The rules should take effect
      immediately. If they're still not running it may that you're not a member of the plugdev
      group. You can fix this as follows (assuming that plugdev is not present on your system):</p>

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        sudo addgroup plugdev
        sudo addgroup yourusername plugdev
</pre>
      <h3>Settings</h3>

      <p>Once connected, start the JMRI program and select "RailDriver Throttle" from the Debug
      menu (It's temporarily located there while we develop the support).</p>

      <p>A Throttle window titled "RailDriver" should open:<br>
      <img src="../../tools/throttle/images/jmri012.jpg" alt="throttle window" class="floatRight"
      height="188" width="154"></p>

      <p>Type the DCC address of your Locomotive into the address box, just like a <a href=
      "../../tools/throttle/ThrottleMain.shtml">regular JMRI Throttle</a>, and click "Set". This
      connects both the Throttle window and the RailDriver console through the DCC system to the
      decoder. You should now be able to operate the Locomotive from the RailDriver.</p>

      <h2 id="tools">Raildriver Tools</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>The top row of buttons across the front edge control the decoder functions. The left
        most (#1 in the figure) is F0, usually the headlight. The next button to the right (#2 in
        the figure) is F1, etc. When you press the button, the function toggles: From Off to On, or
        On to Off. Try pressing one, and see if the Throttle function buttons on the screen and the
        functions in the Locomotive respond.</li>

        <li>The "Bell" button (#37 in the figure) drives F3 (this can be changed by editing a file
        in the JMRI distribution if your DCC system uses something different). It's momentary, so
        F3 is set on when the button is pressed, and off when it's released.</li>

        <li>The horn lever (#38 in the figure) operates F2. Push it forward or back to turn F2 On,
        and release or center it to turn F2 Off.</li>

        <li>The left-most large handle, labeled "Forward N Reverse" (#39 in the figure) serves to
        control direction. Since (most) DCC decoders don't have a neutral position, the N position
        isn't used.</li>

        <li>The next lever, labelled "Dyn Brake Throttle" (#40 in the figure), controls the decoder
        speed setting. For now, zero speed is (roughly) the center, and higher speeds are when the
        lever is pulled back.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Eventually, we'd like to make a more detailed simulation available by connecting the rest
      of the controls, and adding a detailed model of the trains braking and acceleration.</p>
