      <h1>Hardware Support: RailDriver Throttle</h1>

      <p>JMRI support for RailDriver is evolving rapidly, so check
      back here or on the <a href=
      "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">JMRI
      users Yahoo group</a> for changes.<br>
      <a href="RailDriver.gif"><img src="RailDriver.gif" align=

      "RailDriver line drawing"></a> <a name="hardware" id=
      "hardware"></a></p>

      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <p>JMRI allows you to use a <a href=
      "http://raildriver.com/">RailDriver</a> from <a href=
      "http://www.piengineering.com/">PI Engineering</a> as a
      Hardware Throttle to run Locomotives with your DCC system.
      RailDriver support was first available in <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri2.1.7.shtml">JMRI
      2.1.7</a>. <a name="connecting" id="connecting"></a></p>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <h3>Wiring</h3>

      <p>First, connect your computer to your DCC system and make
      sure that the regular <a href=
      "../../tools/throttle/ThrottleMain.shtml">JMRI Throttles</a>
      are working fine (Unless you do this first, debugging
      possible problems connecting the RailDriver is very
      difficult.)</p>

      <p>Next, plug the RailDriver into a USB port on your computer
      while your JMRI application (PanelPro or DecoderPro) isn't
      running.</p>

      <h3>Settings</h3>

      <p>Once connected, start the JMRI program and select
      "RailDriver Throttle" from the Debug menu (It's temporarily
      located there while we develop the support).</p>

      <p>A Throttle window titled "RailDriver" should open:<br>
      <img src="../../tools/throttle/images/jmri012.jpg" alt=
      "throttle window" align="right" height="188" width="154"></p>

      <p>Type the DCC address of your Locomotive into the address
      box, just like a <a href=
      "../../tools/throttle/ThrottleMain.shtml">regular JMRI
      Throttle</a>, and click "Set". This connects both the
      Throttle window and the RailDriver console through the DCC
      system to the decoder. You should now be able to operate the
      Locomotive from the RailDriver. <a name="tools" id=
      "tools"></a></p>

      <h2>Raildriver Tools</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>The top row of buttons across the front edge control
        the decoder functions. The left most (#1 in the figure) is
        F0, usually the headlight. The next button to the right (#2
        in the figure) is F1, etc. When you press the button, the
        function toggles: From Off to On, or On to Off. Try
        pressing one, and see if the Throttle function buttons on
        the screen and the functions in the Locomotive
        respond.</li>

        <li>The "Bell" button (#37 in the figure) drives F3 (this
        can be changed by editing a file in the JMRI distribution
        if your DCC system uses something different). It's
        momentary, so F3 is set on when the button is pressed, and
        off when it's released.</li>

        <li>The horn lever (#38 in the figure) operates F2. Push it
        forward or back to turn F2 On, and release or center it to
        turn F2 Off.</li>

        <li>The left-most large handle, labeled "Forward N Reverse"
        (#39 in the figure) serves to control direction. Since
        (most) DCC decoders don't have a neutral position, the N
        position isn't used.</li>

        <li>The next lever, labelled "Dyn Brake Throttle" (#40 in
        the figure), controls the decoder speed setting. For now,
        zero speed is (roughly) the center, and higher speeds are
        when the lever is pulled back.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Eventually, we'd like to make a more detailed simulation
      available by connecting the rest of the controls, and adding
      a detailed model of the trains braking and acceleration.
