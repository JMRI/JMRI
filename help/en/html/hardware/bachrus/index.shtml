      <h1>Hardware Support: Speedometers</h1>

      <p>JMRI supports the Bachrus MTS-DCC Model train Speedometer,
      and the KPF-Zeller Speedometer, which are input-only devices,
      to capture speed information from a locomotive on a running stand.</p>

          <p>Bachrus has retired as of 2018. Information on the Bachrus Speedometer products stored on
          the WaybackMachine from the <a href=

      <h3>KPF-Zeller Speedometer</h3>

      For more information on the KPF-Zeller hardware, see

      <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

      <p>When a speedometer is set as a JMRI Layout Connection Preference, the Speedo Console
      tool can be used to display scale running speed for any scale from Z to O and beyond.</p>

      Left hand side of Speedo panel
      <p>When a speedometer is set as a layout connection alongside a DCC hardware system the
      speedo utility allows automated measurement of a DCC decoder equipped loco's speed
      profile.</p>
      <a href="images/profile.jpg"><img src="images/profile.jpg" width="543" height="373" alt=
      "Speedometer speed profile graph"></a><br>
      Right hand side of Speedo panel
      <p>
      At the bottom of the right side is a "Speed Matching" section.
      This configures the Vstart (3) and Vhigh (4) CVs to match the
      your desired speeds at speed step 1 and 28.
      The Vmid CV is set to half way between these to attempt
      to set a straight-line speed curve.</p>
      <a href="images/SpeedMatchSection.png"><img src="images/SpeedMatchSection.png"></a>
      <p>
      Note that after these CVs have been set by running the matching,
      you should go to the DecoderPro roster entry for this decoder
      and do a "Read Full Sheet"
      of the "Basic Speed Control" pane to capture the new values.
      <p>
      If you are doing this on the the programming track,
      the process will have set the momentum CVs to zero and restored them on
      successful completion. This is done
      to avoid them interfering with the matching process. If you're programming
      on the main track, this step is skipped.  In that case, make sure that you
      have set the momentum CVs to zero before starting the process, and
      restore them manually afterwards.
