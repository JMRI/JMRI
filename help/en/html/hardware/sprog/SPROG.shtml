      JMRI Hardware Guide: SPROG
      </H2>

	<H3>Supported Hardware</H3>

    JMRI supports the SPROG both as a decoder programmer, and
    also as a mini-command station.  For more information on these
    capabilities, see the 
    <a href="http://www.sprog-dcc.co.uk/downloads/SprogIIUserGuide.pdf">SPROG manual</a>
    on the 
    <a href="http://www.sprog-dcc.co.uk/">SPROG web site</a>.
	
	<p>Note that there are several different versions
	of the SPROG hardware, and even more versions of the 
	SPROG software.</P>

	<H3>Setup</H3>

	  <ol>
	  <li> Original SPROGs were connected via a 9-pin serial cable. Current SPROGs
          are available as USB only. Connect your SPROG using the appropriate cable
          and power it up. 
      
      <li>USB-connected SPROGs on Windows may need to have a 
          driver installed. For more information on that, see
          the <a href="http://www.sprog-dcc.co.uk/downloads/SprogIIUserGuide.pdf">SPROG manual</a>
          on the 
          <a href="http://www.sprog-dcc.co.uk/">SPROG web site</a>.
          Windows 7 users may also be interested in 
          <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUG7dsXi2cI">this video</a>.

	  <li> Make sure you have the latest version of JMRI, then go to the preferences
          panel of a JMRI-based program.  This
	      opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select
	      it from the "Edit" menu

      <li>SPROG can either be a stand-alone decoder programmer, or it
        can be set to act as a mini-command station for running trains.
        You have to select which mode to use in the preferences, and
        then JMRI configures the necessary options in the SPROG.
      <ul>
	  <li>For DCC programmer operation, select "SPROG" from the top selection 
          box.

	  <li>For command station operation, select "SPROG Command Station" from the
          top selection box.
      </ul>
      
      <li>You can then select the proper serial port in the second selection box.
      Note that the USB SPROG drivers will appear as a serial port. 

	  <li> The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to
	  select how the program will look. "Metal" is the native Java look
	  available on all types. Other choices will vary with your computer type.
	  "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on Linux,
	  Windows, MacOS "Classic" and Mac OS X respectively.

	  <li> In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer
	  format. You can override this each time you open the programmer, so this
	  is here just for convenience.

	  <li> Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
	  quit, click "Yes".</li>
	  <li> Restart the program. You should be up and running.
	  </ol>

	<H3>Configuring SPROG</H3>
          <p>SPROG uses a "Mode Word" to set a number of optional operating modes</p>

          <p>In all recent SPROGs, the default value is the Mode Word is correct for
          both programmer and command station modes. For older SPROGs you may wish
          check or modify the Mode Word as follows</p>

          <p>Open the Command Monitor and Send Command windows from the SPROG menu
          and send an "M" command. You should see a reply in the command monitor window
          something like:<br>
	  <ul>
	  <tt>
	  P&gt;M=h800<br>
	  </tt>
	  </ul></p>

          <p>The h prefix indicates a hexadecimal value. If the value you see is
          different, then it should be changed by sending the command "M h800".
          Follow this with the command "W" to save the change in SPROGs EEPROM
          memory so that it is effective each time you power up the SPROG.
          Otherwise, the new value will be lost when you power off the SPROG.
          Please do not be tempted to experiment with other Mode Word values as
          this could result in erratic bahaviour of your SPROG.</p>

	<H3>Identifying SPROG Firmware Version</H3>
          <p>Open the Command Monitor and Send Command windows from the SPROG menu
          and send an "?" command. You should see a reply in the command monitor window
          something like:<br>
	  <ul>
	  <tt>
	  SPROG II USB Ver 2.3<br>
	  P&gt;<br>
	  </tt>
	  </ul>

	<H3>Firmware Updates</H3>
          <p>SPROG includes a "bootloader" feature that allows the firmware (the
          internal software that operates the SPROG) to be updated by the user.</p>
          <p>The bootloader is functional in USB SPROG II version 2.2 and later</p>
          <p>In some earlier versions the bootloader is not completely functional and
          the firmware update tools in JMRI should NOT be used without first checking
          the current firmware version (see above) and contacting SPROG DCC to ascertain
          if that version can be updated by the user.</p>
          <p>Under no circumstances should you
          experiment with the firmware update tool if you do not have a valid update file
          available. Doing so could result in your SPROG becoming non-responsive. It will
          then need to be returned to the manufacturer (or local representative)
          for unlocking.</p>
