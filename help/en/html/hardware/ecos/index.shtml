      <h1>Hardware Support: ESU ECoS</h1><a name="hardware" id=
      "hardware"></a>

      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <h3>Command Station</h3>

      <p>JMRI can connect to an ESU ECoS command station via an
      Internet connection.</p>
      <p>Support for ECoS was first available
      in <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri2.3.3.shtml">JMRI
      2.3.3</a>.<br>
      Support for the ECoS Throttle was first available in <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri2.7.4.shtml">JMRI
      2.7.4</a>.<br>
      Support for the ECoS s88 Feedback Sensors was first available
      in <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri2.7.9.shtml">JMRI
      2.7.9</a>.<br>
      Support for the ECoS RailCom Feedback was first available in
      <a href="http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri2.99.7.shtml">JMRI
      2.99.7</a>. <a name="limitations" id="limitations"></a></p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <p>Programming is supported by the ECoS from firmware version
      4.1. However this works only on the programming track.
      Programming on main is only available directly from your ECoS.
      Additional information on the ECoS can be found on the
      <a href="http://www.esu.eu/en/support/tips-tricks/ecos/">ESU web
      site</a>.</p>

      <p>Consisting is not yet supported.</p>

      <a name="connecting" id="connecting"></a>
      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <h3>Settings</h3>
      <p>To configure the connection:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the JMRI "Preferences" under the "Edit" menu,</li>

        <li>Select "ESU" as the System Manufacturer</li>

        <li>Select "ECoS" as the System Connection (the only
        option)</li>

        <li>Enter the IP address for your ECoS unit</li>

        <li>Leave the port number at 15471</li>

        <li>Click "Save" &amp; restart</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Turnout, Sensor and a basic Throttle and power support is
      available for a JMRI-connected ECoS unit.</p>

      <h3>Throttles</h3>
      <p>Only basic support for Throttles via the
      ECoS is supported. When an entry from the Roster, or a DCC
      address is directly entered into the address field, JMRI will
      check the existing list of ECoS Locos for a match on the
      first DCC address it comes across. If there is no match, the
      Throttle will create an entry in the ECoS database which will
      be listed as "Created By JMRI" with a default of 128 speed
      steps.<br>
      From version 2.9.4 when you close down JMRI, you will be
      prompted to either delete or keep the entries in the
      ECoS.</p>

      <p>Consisting is <strong>NOT</strong> supported.</p>

      <h3>Sensors</h3>
      ECoS-connected Sensors on the s88 bus have
      names like "US100:01", where "U" is the system name for esU
      ECoS, "S" means sensor, "100" is the s88 board address
      registered in the ECoS, and "01" is the port on that board.

      <h3>Turnouts</h3>
      ECoS-connected Turnouts have names like
      "UT123", where "U" is the system name for esU ECoS, "T" means
      turnout, and "123" is the address.

      <h3>ECoS initialisation</h3>
      <p>When JMRI first starts up, it
      reads the Turnout, Sensor and Locomotive information from the
      ECoS, which might take a couple of seconds. Turnouts and
      Sensors are both automatically added to the JMRI Sensor
      Table. This is necessary so that a link can be made between
      the Sensors and Turnouts configured in the ECoS and the
      accessory address that JMRI uses.<br>
      While gathering the Locomotive information from the ECoS,
      JMRI will check to see if there is already a Roster entry
      associated with each Loco. If the check fails, the system
      will ask if you wish to add/import the Loco to the JMRI Roster.

      <h3>ECoS Loco Database</h3>
      The <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/ecos/swing/locodatabase/EcosLocoTable.shtml">ECoS Loco Database</a> tool allows
      you to view all the Locos that are configured on the ECoS,
      assign them to a JMRI Roster entry or Import it in to the
      JMRI Roster.

      <h4>Importing Locos from the ECoS</h4>
      When importing a Loco
      into JMRI, the program currently only creates a skeleton record
      that contains the Loco Name along with the decoder type - if
      selected - and the Loco DCC Address. This process does not
      currently import into JMRI any CV values stored on the ECoS.

      <h4>Exporting Locos to the ECoS</h4>
      When a new Roster entry
      is created in JMRI, you will be asked if you wish to add the
      Roster entry into the ECoS Database. The ECoS entry will use
      the Roster ID as the Loco Name, set the speed steps 128, and
      set the Loco Address. The number of speeds steps may later be
      changed in the ECoS Preferences menu.<br>
      Use the Add Loco to ECoS tool to manually copy a Roster entry
      from JMRI to your ECoS.
