JMRI: Modbus Support
</h1>

<p><em>The support on this page is rapidly evolving; the
actual code might be ahead or behind the documentation
on any given day. Note that Modbus support is not
in any JMRI test or production releases yet.</em></p>

<p>JMRI provides support for general JMRI
<a href="../../tools/Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a>
and
<a href="../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnouts</a>
via Modbus connections.</p>

<p>A Modbus installation has one master node, and one or more slave nodes.
Generally, the master writes to "coil" objects in the slave nodes, and 
reads from "discrete input" objects in the slave nodes. 
The "coil" terminology comes from relay coil, solenoid coil, etc; a
way to change the node's output signals. The "discrete input" a single bit from 
some external input.
By reading and writing these in a node, 
a Modbus master can sense the condition of the layout (through discrete inputs)
and control it (through coils).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.modbus.org">Modbus is an industrial control system</a>
that's usually used with pretty tough, 
highly-engineering equipment.  
The Modbus nodes are often "programmable logic controllers" (PLCs)
which can do their own calculations of how to control devices.

<h2>JMRI Modbus connections</h2>

JMRI will eventually support operation as either the master node, or as one of the slave nodes.

<h2>JMRI as Master Node</h2>

<em>(There is no code support for this yet)</em>
<p>
When JMRI is the master node driving a selection of remote Modbus nodes, the
net effect is very similar to the familiar C/MRI system.  There's a master (JMRI)
that communicates with input (Sensor) and output (Turnout, Light) lines in remote nodes. 
Each Modbus discrete input in a remote node gets configured as a JMRI Sensor; each Modbus
coil becomes a Turnout or Light.

<p>
JMRI can handle multiple remote nodes once they've been configured in the JMRI preferences.

<p>
There are multiple ways to configure this connection:  
TCP/IP vs RS485, ASCII vs RTU protocol, etc.
Each of these requires separate code.

<h2>JMRI as Slave Node</h2>

It's also possible for JMRI to be a slave node.  In that case a PLC
or other unit is the master node, and reads/writes JMRI when it needs to.
At first, this will probably seem odd; JMRI is usually used as the central
control for the layout.  
But note that Modbus is an industrial-strength system, and 
JMRI is not. If you want <em>really</em> robust railroad controls, you 
can built it using PLCs communicating with each other for operation, and only
communicating with JMRI to display status on a panel, get operator input, etc.

<p>
In that case, it's quite natural for JMRI to appear as a slave node on the Modbus.

<p>
When configured as a slave, JMRI appears as coils and discrete inputs to the Modbus master.
Modbus:
<ul>
<li>allows the master to read and write coils in the slave, but can only read
discrete inputs; it can't write to discrete inputs in a slave.
<li>some popular PLC environments can only write to coils and read from discrete
inputs
</ul>

Normally, JMRI provides an interface to the real layout via 
internal objects such as Turnouts and Sensors that
are closely mapped to corresponding physical devices.
This mapping is done via "System Names", which both 
identify the how to access a particular device, and
are the key to looking up the corresponding object in JMRI.
Here, we have to pick a naming convention that allows those
inside-JMRI work with the properties of Modbus.

<p>
We therefore provide the following mapping:

<dl>
<dt>JMRI Turnout MTnnn, e.g. MT123</dt>
<dd>This will appear as Modbus coil nnn and discrete input nnn, e.g. coil 123 and discrete input 123
<dt>JMRI Sensor MSnnn, e.g. MS123</dt>
<dd>This will appear as Modbus coil nnn+1000 and discrete input nnn+1000, e.g. coil 1123 and discrete input 1123
</dl>

The master node can read from either the coil or discrete input for either Turnout or Sensor.
It can write to the coil number to change the status of the Turnout or Sensor within JMRI.
A "1" is THROWN or ACTIVE, respectively; a "0" is CLOSED or INACTIVE.

<p>
Until each coil is first written or set within JMRI, the state of the associated Turnout or Sensor will be "UNKNOWN"
and it will be read back as zero on Modbus.

<p>
With this convention, you can put Turnouts and Sensors on your JMRI panel, and then
connect them to PLC code that will tell them what to display.  If desired, local changes,
e.g. clicking on the screen, can be read back and used to control the railroad.

<h3>Configuring as a Slave Node</h3>

In the Preferences pane for Connections, select "Modbus" and "RS485 ASCII Slave".  
Then select the communications (serial) port your interface is connected on, 
the baud rate, and 
enter the node number your master node will use to refer to JMRI.  
Click "Save", quit and restart.

<p>
Next, use the Turnout and Sensor tables to define your sensors, 
which will in the process define the coils and discrete inputs
that Modbus will read and write. Save this configuration to a panel file
so that it can be reloaded when you start JMRI again in the future.



<h2>Naming</h2>

The default <a href="../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">system letter</a> 
for Modbus connections is "M". It can be configured to another letter if desired.
