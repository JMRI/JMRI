<h1>Hardware Setup Support: Raspberry Pi via GPIO</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> is a family of inexpensive credit card size single board computers that have many applications in embedded electronics.  This page describe's the use of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins under JMRI.  Since the Raspberry Pi runs Linux natively, other connections are also possible using either a <a href="../USBtoSerial.shtml">USB connection</a> or via the Raspberry Pi's built in serial ports.</p>

<a name="hardware"></a><h2>Supported Hardware</h2>
<p>Theoretically, any Raspberry Pi supported by <a href="http://pi4j.com/">Pi4J</a> is supported by JMRI.<br>
JMRI support has been tested with the Models B, B+ and 2B. There's also a <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/install/Raspbian.shtml">JMRI install help page for the Pi</a>.</p>

<a name="connecting"></a><h2>Connecting</h2>
<h3>Wiring</h3>
<p>Underlying support for the Raspberry Pi's GPIO connections is provided using the <a href="http://pi4j.com/">Pi4J library for Java</a>.<br>
<b><i>This library requires that applications using GPIO pins be run as root (or using <code>sudo</code></i></b>).</p>
<p>JMRI currently supports inputs (Sensors) and outputs (Turnouts) via the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.</p> 

<h4>Input/Output pin addressing</h4>
<p>
JMRI currently uses the default Pi4J pin numbering.  The Pin numbers may differ on each model Pi.  Generally speaking, Broadcom GPIO pins 0 to 7 may be referenced by those pin numbers in JMRI.  This is not guaranteed to be the case.  Higher pin numbers are available, but may not correspond to the Broadcom pin numberings.  Please refer to the <a href="http://pi4j.com/">Pi4J website</a> for model specific pin numbering information.
</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
  <ol>
  <li> Make sure you have the latest version of JMRI installed, then 
  go to the Preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.  This opens 
  automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select it
  from the "Edit" menu
  <li>Select "Raspberry Pi Foundation" from the System Manufacturer 
  selection box.
  <li>Select "Raspberry Pi GPIO" from the System Connection selection box.
<!--
  <li> The "Connection Prefix" is used to help JMRI communicate 
  separately with multiple "connections" to layout hardware. Each 
  "connection" must have a unique identifier, which is specified as
  the "Connection Prefix". By default, the first XBee connection is 
  given a prefix of "Pi", and additional XBee networks are given 
  prefixes like "Pi", "Pi2", ... Most users should be able to use the 
  default "Connection Prefix" value provided by the JMRI tools. 

  <li>When a JMRI tool is configured for more than one connection, 
  each connection gets a menu item on the main JMRI tool window. To 
  help users differentiate between their different connections, each 
  connection has a "Connection Name", which is used as the name of 
  the associated menu item on the main JMRI tool window. Users may 
  change the "Connection Name" for any connection to suit their needs.
-->
  <li> Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
  quit, click "Yes".</li>
  <li> Restart the program. You should be up and running.
