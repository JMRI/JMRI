      <h1>Hardware Setup Support: Raspberry Pi via GPIO</h1>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>
      is a family of inexpensive credit card size single board
      computers that have many applications in embedded
      electronics. This page describe's the use of the Raspberry
      Pi's GPIO pins under JMRI. Since the Raspberry Pi runs Linux
      natively, other connections are also possible using either a
      <a href="../USBtoSerial.shtml">USB connection</a> or via the
      Raspberry Pi's built in serial ports.</p><img src=

      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <p>Theoretically, any Raspberry Pi supported by <a href=
      "http://pi4j.com/">Pi4J</a> is supported by JMRI.<br>
      JMRI support has been tested with the Models B, B+, 2B, and 3.
      There's also a <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/install/Raspbian.shtml">JMRI install help
      page for the Pi</a>.</p><a name="connecting" id=
      "connecting"></a>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <h3>Wiring</h3>

      <p>Underlying support for the Raspberry Pi's GPIO connections
      is provided using the <a href="http://pi4j.com/">Pi4J library
      for Java</a>.</p>


      <p><b>Version 1.0 of the Pi4J Library, used with JMRI version
      4.5.4 and earlier, <i>require that applications using GPIO pins
      be run as root (or using <code>sudo</code></i></b>).</p>

      <p><b>Starting with version 4.5.5, JMRI uses version 1.1 of the 
      Pi4J Library.  Version 1.1 of the Pi4J library, <i>when used in 
      conjunction with Raspbian Jessie (and later releases)</i> allow
      the user to access the GPIO pins without running as root.  For
      compatability reasons, and to allow possible use of PWM outputs, 
      JMRI has choosen not to enable this mode by default.</b></p>

      <p><b><i>In order to enable use of the GPIO pins by a non-root
      user, the user must set the <code>WIRINGPI_GPIOMEM</code> 
      environment variable as follows:</i></b></p>

      <p><code>export WIRINGPI_GPIOMEM=1</code></p>

      <p><b>This environment varialbe must be set prior to executing 
      JMRI</b></p>.  
     <p>For more information, please see the relavent portions of 
     <a href="http://www.savagehomeautomation.com/projects/pi4j-now-supports-non-privileged-access-no-more-rootsudo.html">the pi4j web page</a>.</p>

      <p>JMRI currently supports inputs (Sensors) and outputs
      (Turnouts) via the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.</p>

      <h4>Input/Output pin addressing</h4>

      <p>JMRI currently uses the default Pi4J pin numbering. The
      Pin numbers may differ on each model Pi. Generally speaking,
      Broadcom GPIO pins 0 to 7 may be referenced by those pin
      numbers in JMRI. This is not guaranteed to be the case.
      Higher pin numbers are available, but may not correspond to
      the Broadcom pin numberings. Please refer to the <a href=
      "http://pi4j.com/">Pi4J website</a> for model specific pin
      numbering information.</p>

      <h3>Settings</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you have the latest version of JMRI
        installed, then go to the Preferences panel of a JMRI-based
        program. This opens automatically the first time a program
        is run, or you can select it from the "Edit" menu</li>

        <li>Select "Raspberry Pi Foundation" from the System
        Manufacturer selection box.</li>

        <li>Select "Raspberry Pi GPIO" from the System Connection
        selection box. <!--
  <li> The "Connection Prefix" is used to help JMRI communicate 
  separately with multiple "connections" to layout hardware. Each 
  "connection" must have a unique identifier, which is specified as
  the "Connection Prefix". By default, the first XBee connection is 
  given a prefix of "Pi", and additional XBee networks are given 
  prefixes like "Pi", "Pi2", ... Most users should be able to use the 
  default "Connection Prefix" value provided by the JMRI tools. 

  <li>When a JMRI tool is configured for more than one connection, 
  each connection gets a menu item on the main JMRI tool window. To 
  help users differentiate between their different connections, each 
  connection has a "Connection Name", which is used as the name of 
  the associated menu item on the main JMRI tool window. Users may 
  change the "Connection Name" for any connection to suit their needs.
--></li>

        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the
        program to quit, click "Yes".</li>

        <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>
