      <h1>Hardware Support: ZIMO MX-1</h1>

      <h2 id="hardware">Supported Hardware</h2>

      <h3>Command Station</h3>

      <h3>Computer Interfaces</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>MX-1 - ASCII Protocol</li>

        <li>MXULF - Binary Protocol <strong>Up to Software 0.61.05</strong></li>

        <li>MX-10 - Binary Protocol (Tentative)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

      <p>ASCII protocol currently only supports programming</p>

      <p>Binary protocol supports the following</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Programming, Both on the Main & Service Mode</li>

        <li>Throttle</li>

        <li>Turnout Control - Tentative</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Note</strong> Testing of the binary protocol has only been possible using the MXULF,
      with the turnout control having not been fully tested. Issues may occur when used with the
      MX-10 but we do not currently have any hardware to test against.
      <h2 id="connecting">Connecting</h2>

      <h3>MX-1 Setup</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>To connect your computer to a ZIMO MX-1 system, you can usually just connect the
        command station to the computer's serial port using a serial cable.</li>

        <li>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program. This opens automatically the
        first time a program is run, or you can select it from the "Edit" menu.</li>

        <li>Select "ZIMO MX-1" from the top selection box. You can then select the proper serial
        port in the second selection box.</li>

        <li>The baud rate selection box will give you choices from 1,200 to 38,400 baud. Select the
        speed that is configured into your MX-1.</li>

        <li>The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to select how the program
        will look. "Metal" is the native Java look available on all types. Other choices will vary
        with your computer type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on
        Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and Mac OS X respectively.</li>

        <li>In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer format. You can
        override this each time you open the programmer, so this is here just for convenience.</li>

        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to quit, click "Yes".</li>

        <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>MXULF / MX-10 Setup</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Connect the MXULF to a Suitable power supply</li>

        <li>Connect the MXULF to the computer via the USB interface, ensure that the display screen
        reads something along the lines of <code>PC &lt;-&gt; MXULF<br>
        Rx: 0 Tx: 0</code><br>
        If the bottom line is not displayed, then remove/re-insert the usb cable.</li>

        <li>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program. This opens automatically the
        first time a program is run, or you can select it from the "Edit" menu.</li>

        <li>From the Manufacturers List, select "ZIMO" and from the system select "MXULF"</li>

        <li>Select the appropriate comm port from the list</li>

        <li>The Baud rate by default is set to 9600, you can change it if needs be from the
        advanced options</li>

        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to quit and restart, click
        "Yes".</li>

        <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>
      </ol>
