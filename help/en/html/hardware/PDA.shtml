      JMRI Install Guide: Using a PDA to Access JMRI Applications
      </h1>
<p>
This page describes an early attempt to connect an Axim PDA to JMRI, which has some flaws and is deprecated. For a supported approach, involving running a specific program
on your Smartphone, see the 
<a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml">WiThrottle</a> page.

<p>Daryl Kruse has been experimenting 
with a Dell Axim PDA for use as a true 2-way Digitrax throttle. 
He's provided the following information
on how he set it up:

<p>
1. Our home has a wireless LAN set up for household members to access 
our cable internet service.

<p>
2. My train computer is connected to our LAN and, of course, is 
connected to JMRI and the LocoNet via an interface.

<p>
3. My Dell Axim has wireless and terminal services client.

<p>
4. After staring up JMRI Throttles and turnout control, I use the 
the terminal services client of the Axim to access the computer 
screen.

<p>
5. I can then control the layout with the Axim.

<p>
I am using the Terminal Services Client that came installed on my 
Axim x50v which came with windows mobile 2003 SE installed as the 
operating system.  On the computer I check the box "allow users to 
connect remotely to this computer" in the control 
panel/systems/remote tab.

<p>
The main, four way button of the Axim can be used to increase (left) 
and decrease (right) speed and set the direction of the train (up-
forward, down-reverse). I use the blunt end of my home made 
uncoupling pic to address the screen in order to select and dispatch 
locos, operate functions and set turnouts. All this can be done 
without ever plugging into the LocoNet.  

<p>
One thing that is a little bit cumbersome is entering the turnout 
numbers into the turnout control.  For this I have to use the Axim 
keyboard.  I would like to use the turnout table, but every accessory 
switch that is used shows up automatically on the table.  As I use 
Route control, a lot of unneeded accessory switch numbers show up 
that I don't need.  Is there any way to set up a table that is set 
with just the accessory switches you want?

<p>

on your Smartphone, see the
