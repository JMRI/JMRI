      <h1>Hardware Support: MQTT</h1>
      <img src="http://mqtt.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mqtt-inside.png" align="right">
      JMRI can
      connect to 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">IOT devices</a>
      via the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT protocol</a>.
      

      <h3>Naming</h3>

      <p>The default system letter is "M", so we'll use that in examples.</p>

      <a name= "limitations" id="limitations"></a>
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      
      Older code (i.e. JMRI 4.12 and later) only 
      supports Turnouts. 
      We hope to add Sensor, Light and Reporter support soon.
      
      <a name="connecting" id="connecting"></a>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>
      
      You tell JMRI about how to connect to your MQTT
      hardware via the Connections pane in the Preferences window.
      Select "MQTT" as the manufacturer name.
      
      <p>
      Currently, JMRI can handle only one MQTT connection at a time.
      You can combine that MQTT connection with other connection types,
      but two MQTT connections won't work properly. This 
      may be improved at some later point if people find a 
      reason to need two MQTT connections.
      
        <h3>Topics</h3>
        
        JMRI MQTT Turnouts are specified with JMRI system names like "MTabcd".
        The "M" is the system connection letter, "T" specifies 
        Turnout, and all after that is a suffix that is used to generate
        the specific topic which JMRI publishes and subscribes to when
        communicating with the layout.
        <p>
        By default, the MQTT topic for a Turnout is constructed by prepending
        "/trains/track/turnout/" to the suffix.  For example, a JMRI Turnout with
        system name MTabcd will publish and subscribe to the topic /trains/track/turnout/abcd.
        There are two parts to that: A base topic common
        to everything JMRI does on that connection, and 
        a type-specific topic specific to each type.
        <p>
        By default the base topic is "/trains/";
        the turnout-specific part is "track/turnout/",
        leading to a complete prefix of "/trains/track/turnout/".
        When e.g. Sensors become available, they might have
        e.g. a type-specific part of "track/sensor/".
        <p>
        <a href="images/MQTT_Preferences.png"><img
        src="images/MQTT_Preferences.png" align="right" height="211"
        width="345"></a>
        You can change the base topic by 
        going to the JMRI Connection preferences,
        selecting your MQTT connection's preference
        pane, checking the "Additional Connection Settings" box,
        and then entering the desired value in the "MQTT channel"
        selection box.  Depending on which kind of computer you
        have, you might have to click once or twice in that box
        before you can enter your new prefix text.  Then
        save your changes and restart the program.
        
        <p>
        You can change the type-specific part of the prepended string using
        a script at startup time.  See the
        <a href="/jython/SetMqttPrefix.py">jython/SetMqttPrefix.py</a>
        sample script for an example.  
        Note that any changes should be made at startup time
        before creating any Turnout objects, i.e. 
        the script must be run as the 
        first startup action before any panel files are loaded.
        Changing the prefix only affects Turnouts that are
        created after the change.

      <h2>Message Content</h2>
        <h3>Turnouts</h3>
            By default, the message content for turnouts is
            "CLOSED" and "THROWN".
        <h3>Changing the Coding</h3>
        <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.15.5</span>
            You can use
            <a href="../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">scripting</a>
            to install a new 
            <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttContentParser.html">jmri.jmrix.mqtt.MqttContentParser</a>
            object to code and decode the content of messages.
            See the 
            <a href="/jython/SetMqttParser.py">jython/SetMqttParser.py</a>
            sample script for how to do that.
            For a Java example, see the
            <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnout.java#L24">inner
            class implementation in MqttTurnout</a>.
            <p>
            Note that you can call
            <code>setParser(...)</code>
            on the
            <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnoutManager.html">jmri.jmrix.mqtt.MqttTurnoutManager</a>
            or on an individual
            <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnout.html">jmri.jmrix.mqtt.MqttTurnout</a>
            object.  If you call it on an individual 
            MqttTurnout, that's the only one that's affected.
            If you call it on the MqttTurnoutManager
            all <u>later created</u> 
            MqttTurnout objects will use the new parser; earlier-created ones
            will not be changed.  This means you should 
            call a script to change this before loading any panel files
            if you want all MqttTurnouts to be modified.
        
    <h2>Debugging</h2>

      <a id="testserver" name="testserver"></a>
      <a href="http://test.mosquitto.org">
        <img src="https://mosquitto.org/stickers/mosquitto-mono.png" height="80" width="80" align="right"></a>
      If you don't have an MQTT system, and want to play with this connection type, 
      you can enter "test.mosquitto.org" for the host name
      to use a publicly-available (non-JMRI) test server. 
      For more information on this server, see the 
      <a href="http://test.mosquitto.org">test.mosquitto.org</a>
      web page.
      <p>
      If you install the 
      <a href="https://mosquitto.org/download/">mosquitto tools</a>
      on your machine,
      you can use a command like
<pre>
    mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -v -t '/trains/#'
</pre>

    to subscribe and print JMRI turnout info as it's published. 
    To publish a change for JMRI to pick up:

<pre>
    mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t /trains/track/turnout/123 -r -m "CLOSED"
    mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t /trains/track/turnout/123 -r -m "THROWN"
</pre>

These commands can be run on the same machine as JMRI, or on a separate machine.
<p>
There are also MQTT tools available for 
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+app+store+mqtt&amp;oq=apple+app+store+mqtt">iOS devices</a> and 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=mqtt&amp;c=apps&amp;authuser">Android devices</a>
that can be useful for monitoring, testing and operating your layout.
