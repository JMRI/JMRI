      <h1>Hardware Support: MQTT</h1>
      <img src="http://mqtt.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mqtt-inside.png" align="right">
      JMRI can
      connect to 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">IOT devices</a>
      via the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT protocol</a>.
      

      <h3>Naming</h3>

      <p>The default system letter is "M", so we'll use that in examples.</p>

      <a name= "limitations" id="limitations"></a>
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      
      Older code (i.e. JMRI 4.12 and later) only 
      supports Turnouts. 
      We hope to add Sensor, Light and Reporter support soon.
      
      <a name="connecting" id="connecting"></a>

      <h2>Connecting</h2>
      
      You tell JMRI about how to connect to your MQTT
      hardware via the Connections pane in the Preferences window.
      Select "MQTT" as the manufacturer name.
      
      <p>
      Currently, JMRI can handle only one MQTT connection at a time.
      You can combine that MQTT connection with other connection types,
      but two MQTT connections won't work properly. This 
      may be improved at some later point if people find a 
      reason to need two MQTT connections.
      
        <h3>Topics</h3>
        
        JMRI MQTT Turnouts are specified with JMRI system names like "MTabcd".
        The "M" is the system connection letter, "T" specifies 
        Turnout, and all after that is a suffix that is used to generate
        the specific topic which JMRI publishes and subscribes to when
        communicating with the layout.
        <p>
        By default, the MQTT topic for a Turnout is constructed by prepending
        "/trains/track/turnout/" to the suffix.  For example, a JMRI Turnout with
        system name MTabcd will publish and subscribe to the "topic /trains/track/turnout/abcd".
        There are two parts to that: A base topic common
        to everything JMRI does on that connection, and 
        a type-specific topic specific to each type.
        <p>
        By default the base topic is "/trains/";
        the turnout-specific part is "track/turnout/",
        leading to a complete prefix of "/trains/track/turnout/".
        <p>
        Sensors are similar, with system names like "MS123" 
        and a topic type-specific part of "track/sensor/".
        For example, by default MS123 will subscribe to the topic 
        "/trains/track/sensor/123".
        <p>
        <a href="images/MQTT_Preferences.png"><img src="images/MQTT_Preferences.png" align="right" height="278" width="278"></a>
        <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.15.5</span>
        You can change the base topic by 
        going to the JMRI Connection preferences,
        selecting your MQTT connection's preference
        pane, checking the "Additional Connection Settings" box,
        and then entering the desired value in the "MQTT channel"
        selection box.  
        You then must 
        save your changes and restart the program; the program
        won't continue to operate normally after changing the base prefix
        until you restart it.
        <p>Note that the default value of "/trains/" is the default for 
        all JMRI instances.  If you use a common broker (like the
        http://test.mosquitto.org test server mentioned below) keeping
        that default prefix will show you traffic from every other JMRI 
        instance connected to that broker.  You should probably
        change that default to something like your own railroad name.
        You might also want to omit the leading slash; it's present in the
        default for historical reasons, but the MQTT authorities
        recommend not having a slash there.
        
        <p>You can change the type-specific
        part of the prepended string using the other fields
        in the preferences.  There are separate fields
        for specifying what JMRI should send (the "transmit" field)
        and what JMRI should recognize back from the layout (the "receive" field).
        If you enter a string, the suffix of the Turnout's system name will be appended:
        "track/turnout/" for MT123 will result in a topic of "/trains/track/turnout/123".
        If you include "{0}" in the string, the suffix will be expanded there, which 
        allows you to do things like enter  "track/turnout/{0}/state" and 
        have that expand to "track/turnout/123/state".s
        Save the preferences
        and restart JMRI to put changes into effect.
        <p>
        You can also change the type-specific part of the prepended string using
        a script at startup time.  See the
        <a href="/jython/SetMqttPrefix.py">jython/SetMqttPrefix.py</a>
        sample script for an example.  
        Note that any changes should be made at startup time
        before creating any Turnout objects, i.e. 
        the script must be run as the 
        first startup action before any panel files are loaded.
        Changing the prefix only affects Turnouts that are
        created after the change.

      <h2>Message Content</h2>
        <h3>Turnouts</h3>
            By default, the message content for turnouts is
            "CLOSED" and "THROWN".
        <h3>Sensors</h3>
            By default, the message content for sensors is
            "ACTIVE" and "INACTIVE".
        <h3>Changing the Coding</h3>
        <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.15.5</span>
            You can use
            <a href="../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">scripting</a>
            to install a new 
            <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttContentParser.html">jmri.jmrix.mqtt.MqttContentParser</a>
            object to code and decode the content of messages.
            You might want to use JSON format, or need to adapt to specific messages from 
            some already-existing devise; you can create a custom parser to do any of that.
            See the 
            <a href="/jython/SetMqttParser.py">jython/SetMqttParser.py</a>
            sample script for how to do that.
            For a Java example, see the
            <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnout.java#L24">inner
            class implementation in MqttTurnout</a>.
            <p>
            Note that you can call
            <code>setParser(...)</code>
            on the
            <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnoutManager.html">jmri.jmrix.mqtt.MqttTurnoutManager</a>
            or on an individual
            <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnout.html">jmri.jmrix.mqtt.MqttTurnout</a>
            object.  If you call it on an individual 
            MqttTurnout, that's the only one that's affected.
            If you call it on the MqttTurnoutManager
            all <u>later created</u> 
            MqttTurnout objects will use the new parser; earlier-created ones
            will not be changed.  This means you should 
            call a script to change this before loading any panel files
            if you want all MqttTurnouts to be modified.
        
    <h2>Debugging</h2>

      <a id="testserver" name="testserver"></a>
      <a href="http://test.mosquitto.org">
        <img src="https://mosquitto.org/stickers/mosquitto-mono.png" height="80" width="80" align="right"></a>
      If you don't have an MQTT system, and want to play with this connection type, 
      you can enter "test.mosquitto.org" for the host name
      to use a publicly-available (non-JMRI) test server. 
      For more information on this server, see the 
      <a href="http://test.mosquitto.org">test.mosquitto.org</a>
      web page.
      <p>
      If you install the 
      <a href="https://mosquitto.org/download/">mosquitto tools</a>
      on your machine,
      you can use a command like
<pre>
    mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -v -t '/trains/#'
</pre>

    to subscribe and print JMRI turnout info as it's published. 
    To publish a change for JMRI to pick up:

<pre>
    mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t /trains/track/turnout/123 -r -m "CLOSED"
    mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t /trains/track/turnout/123 -r -m "THROWN"
</pre>

These commands can be run on the same machine as JMRI, or on a separate machine.
<p>
There are also MQTT tools available for 
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+app+store+mqtt&amp;oq=apple+app+store+mqtt">iOS devices</a> and 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=mqtt&amp;c=apps&amp;authuser">Android devices</a>
that can be useful for monitoring, testing and operating your layout.
