      <p><a href="https://mqtt.org" target="_blank">MQTT</a> is a "client-server publish-subscribe"
      protocol, meaning that JMRI connects to an MQTT server and subscribes to receive messages on
      certain topics. JMRI also publishes messages to the MQTT server and any device subscribed to
      that topic will receive a copy. This approach makes it relatively easy for the model
      railroader to use MQTT communication to develop any number of layout control and automation
      scenarios.</p>

      <p>Devices both on and off the layout can use the MQTT protocol to connect to JMRI. As of
      release 4.21.1, JMRI implements MQTT-connected turnouts, sensors, and lights with additional
      object types expected in the future. For other objects and devices off the layout, you can
      use a provided <a href="#scripts">script</a> or write your own using JMRI's MQTT Adapter
      object and methods. You can use JMRI's MQTT capability to communicate with <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank">IOT devices</a> as well as
      <a href="../arduino/index.shtml">arduinos</a> and other microcontrollers.</p>

      <h2 id="connecting">Connecting to the MQTT Message Broker</h2>

      <p>Establish a connection to an MQTT message broker via the Connections pane in the <a href=
      "../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Preferences window.</a></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Select "MQTT" as the "System manufacturer"</li>

        <li>Select "MQTT Connection" as the "System Connection" (it is possible that "MQTT
        Simulator" may be added to this list in the future to allow testing without direct
        attachment to an MQTT broker).</li>

        <li>The "IP Address/Host Name" should be "localhost" if you are running an MQTT message
        broker on the same machine as JMRI, or the IP address or host name of an external server
        (see under <a href="#testing">Testing</a>).
        </li>

        <li>The default "Connection Prefix" for MQTT is "M" (this can be changed when setting up
        the connection).</li>

        <li>The default "Connection Name" is "MQTT." Currently, JMRI can handle only one MQTT
        connection at a time. [This may be changed at some point necessitating the ability to
        change the Connection Name.]</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can establish an MQTT connection at the same time as other connection types.</p>

      <h2 id="objects">Layout Objects</h2>

      <h3 id="limitations">Available Objects</h3>

      <p>Older versions of JMRI (4.12 and earlier) directly support Turnouts only. Sensors and
      Lights were added in version 4.21.1. Direct support for Reporters is expected to be added in
      version 4.22. Support for Signal Masts is planned but not yet scheduled.</p>

      <p>MQTT messages can be sent and received and used with other object types, such as <a href=
      "../../tools/Memories.shtml">Memories</a>, by writing custom <a href=
      "#scripts">scripts.</a></p>

      <h3>Object Names</h3>

      <p>As with all objects within JMRI, directly supported layout objects (turnouts, sensors, and
      lights) using MQTT must have a <a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">"system name"</a>
      and may have a "user name." If you are assigning the system name manually, the first letter
      must be the <a href="#connecting">MQTT Connection Prefix.</a> The next character must be an
      Object Type of "T", "S", or "L" for turnout, sensor, or light, respectively. The remainder of
      the name does not have to follow any particular model and can be any alphanumeric characters.
      For example, JMRI MQTT Turnouts can be specified with JMRI system names such as "MTabcd" or
      "MT123" or "MT.X$42".</p>

      <p>If you create objects by "adding" them to their tables, select "MQTT" from the pulldown
      and the Connection Prefix and Object Type will automatically be inserted when the objects are
      created.</p>

      <p><a href="#top"><em><small>[Go to top of page]</small></em></a>
      </p>

      <h2 id="topics">MQTT Topics</h2>

      <h3>Topics for Available Objects</h3>

      <p><span class="since">Since JMRI 4.15.5</span> JMRI publishes and receives MQTT messages on
      specific "topics." An MQTT topic is the label or headline for a message that is broadcast or
      subscribed to. MQTT topics within JMRI are formed by concatenating:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the base topic or "MQTT channel,"</li>

        <li>the object type-specific MQTT topic (may be different for publishing and subscribing),
        and</li>

        <li>the object's system name suffix.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The designated "MQTT channel" and object type-specific MQTT topics can be seen and changed
      by selecting "Additional Connection Settings" on the MQTT Connection page under
      Preferences.</p>

      <p>Using the defaults in the JMRI Preferences Connection pane <a href=
      "images/MQTT_Preferences_rel4_21_2.png"><img src="images/MQTT_Preferences_rel4_21_2.png" alt=
      "MQTT preferences rel 4.21.2" class="floatRight" height="278" width="278">shown in the
      picture to the right</a>, JMRI constructs the MQTT topic to send status of a Turnout with
      system name "MTabcd" by concatenating:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the channel: "/trains/"</li>

        <li>the object-type specific "send" topic: "track/turnout/"</li>

        <li>the system name suffix: "abcd"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>yielding the complete message topic: "/trains/track/turnout/abcd".</p>

      <p>All default components can by changed on the MQTT connection tab (check the "Additional
      Connection Settings" box), and then entering the desired values. It is recommended that you
      change the default channel, typically to something based on your own railroad name. Current
      guidance from the MQTT community is not to have a leading slash; it is present in the JMRI
      default for historical reasons. [A good reason to change the default is that "/trains/" is
      the default for all users of JMRI. If you use a public MQTT message broker such as
      htttp://test.mosquitto.org test server (<a href="#testing">linked below</a>), keeping that
      default channel will show you messages from every other JMRI instance anywhere in the world
      also using the default channel and connected to that broker -- and show everyone else your
      messages!]</p>

      <p>You can change the object type-specific part of each topic using the other fields on the
      Preferences Connection page. There are separate fields for specifying what JMRI should
      publish (the "send" field) and what JMRI should subscribe to (recognize back from the layout,
      the "receive" field). The initial defaults contain two parts ("track/" and an object-specific
      part) and are the same for publish and subscribe but they need not be in this format. As
      noted below, identical send and receive topics are recommended for normal use.</p>

      <p>If you want the object's system name suffix to be in the topic string at some place other
      than at the end, you can use a "wild card" of "{0}" within the string to put the object's
      system name suffix at that place. This allows you to set up topics like
      "track/turnout/{0}/state" so JMRI will generate "/trains/track/turnout/abc123/state" for
      turnout "MTabc123".</p>

      <p class="noted">Be sure to save the JMRI Preferences if you have changed anything (hit the
      "Save" button on the Preferences list pane) and restart JMRI to put the changes into
      effect.</p>

      <p>You can also change the object type-specific part of the topic strings as part of JMRI
      start-up using a script as described <a href="#scripts">below.</a></p>

      <h3>Topic Use</h3>

      <p>JMRI only uses some of the listed topics for its standard actions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensors</strong>: JMRI expects to receive sensor state on the "Sensor receive
        topic." It sends state on the "Sensor send topic" if a user changes sensor state by
        clicking on a panel or table.</li>

        <li>
          <strong>Turnouts</strong>: JMRI sends on the "Turnout send topic" if a user commands a
          turnout change by clicking on a panel or table. Additionally, if a Turnout has been
          created in either the Direct mode or Monitoring mode (see <a href=
          "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml#Turnout_Feedback">turnout
          documentation</a>), JMRI expects to received turnout state on the "Turnout receive
          topic."
        </li>

        <li><strong>Lights</strong>: JMRI sends on the "Light send topic" if a user commands a
        Light change by clicking on a panel or table. JMRI also acts on Light state messages sent
        from the layout on the "Light receive topic."</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All other messages, even on defined topics, are ignored by the standard JMRI processing.
      To avoid confusion, it is recommended that send and receive topics are set the same except
      for advanced usage involving custom programmed layout microcontrollers. Any message topic,
      defined or custom, can be subscribed to and processed by a custom script.</p>

      <h3>Custom Topics</h3>

      <p>It is possible to use the JMRI MQTT capability to send and receive messages at any time on
      a topic of your own choosing via a script (<a href="#scripts">see below</a>). These messages
      can further be used to trigger <a href="../../tools/Logix.shtml">Logix,</a> populate <a href=
      "../../tools/Memories.shtml">Memories</a> and then displayed on panels, or whatever purposes
      you find useful.</p>

      <p><a href="#top"><em><small>[Go to top of page]</small></em></a>
      </p>
      <!-- *=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*= -->

      <h2 id="payload">Message Content</h2>

      <p>Message "payloads" for JMRI objects are typically single words that represent the state of
      the object. It is also possible to replace the standard message payloads by using a <a href=
      "#scripts">custom version of the message parser</a> (including using <a href=
      "https://www.json.org/json-en.html" target="_blank">JSON messages</a>).</p>

      <p>Note that some of the behavior listed in the following sub-sections is under review and
      future JMRI release (beyond version 4.21.3) may makes behaviors more consistent.</p>

      <h3>Sensors</h3>
      <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.21.1</span> The expected message content for sensors is
      "ACTIVE" and "INACTIVE". Any other message will generate a Warning in the <a href=
      "../../../package/apps/SystemConsole.shtml">JMRI System Console</a> but will not change the
      Sensor state.
      <h3>Turnouts</h3>
      The expected message content (send, also receive in Direct or Monitoring mode) for turnouts
      is "CLOSED" and "THROWN". Turnouts in Direct or Monitoring mode can also receive messages and
      have their Known State set to "INCONSISTENT" and "UNKNOWN". Receiving any other message will
      generate a Warning in the <a href="../../../package/apps/SystemConsole.shtml">JMRI System
      Console</a> and will set the turnout Known state to "UNKNOWN."
      <h3>Lights</h3>
      <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.21.1</span> The expected message content for lights is "ON"
      and "OFF". Receiving any other messages will result in a Warning in the <a href=
      "../../../package/apps/SystemConsole.shtml">JMRI System Console.</a> and cause the Light
      state to be set to "UNKNOWN."
      <p><a href="#top"><em><small>[Go to top of page]</small></em></a>
      </p>
      <!-- *=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*= -->

      <h2 id="scripts">Scripting</h2>

      <p>The JMRI MQTT capability is very general and can be used to send and receive arbitrary
      messages from any MQTT-aware device on or off the layout. In addition, scripts can be used to
      change standard message processing and default parameters.</p>

      <p>All the scripts discussed here can be found in <a href="../../../../../jython/MQTT/">the
      JMRI distribution jython directory under "MQTT."</a> More information about scripting with
      JMRI is provided under <a href="../../tools/scripting/index.shtml">Scripting</a> in the JMRI
      Help and web site. Custom scripts for MQTT will typically use the <a href=
      "https://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttAdapter.html">MQTT Adapter object and
      methods.</a></p>

      <h4>Changing the Default Message Parsing</h4>
      <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.15.5</span>
      <p>You can use a script to install a new <a href=
      "../../../../../JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttContentParser.html">MqttContentParser</a>
      object to code and decode the content of messages. You might want to use JSON format, or need
      to adapt to specific messages from some already-existing device; you can create a custom
      parser to do any of that. See the <a href=
      "../../../../../jython/MQTT/SetMqttParser.py">SetMqttParser.py</a> sample script. For a Java
      example, see the <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnout.java#L41"
      target="_blank">inner class implementation in MqttTurnout</a>.</p>

      <p>Note that you can call <code>setParser(...)</code> on the <a href=
      "../../../../../JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnoutManager.html">jmri.jmrix.mqtt.MqttTurnoutManager</a>
      or on an individual <a href=
      "../../../../../JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnout.html">jmri.jmrix.mqtt.MqttTurnout</a>
      object. If you call it on the MqttTurnoutManager, all <strong>later created</strong>
      MqttTurnout objects will use the new parser; earlier-created ones will not be changed. This
      means you should execute a script to change the parser before loading any panel files if you
      want all MqttTurnouts to be modified.</p>

      <h4>Publishing Messages</h4>

      <p>The <a href="../../../../../jython/MQTT/SendMqttMessage.py">SendMqttMessage.py</a> is an
      example of how to send any message on any topic (automatically prefixed with the JMRI MQTT
      channel) for processing by other devices.</p>

      <h4>Subscribing to (Receiving) Messages</h4>

      <p>You can use the <a href=
      "../../../../../jython/MQTT/ReceiveMqttMessage.py">ReceiveMqttMessage.py</a> script to
      subscribe to any topic on the JMRI MQTT channel (both for JMRI objects and custom) to receive
      message for further processing. Standard <a href=
      "https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-5-mqtt-topics-best-practices/" target=
      "_blank">MQTT wildcards (# and +)</a> can be used (as of release 4.21.3).</p>

      <h4>Changing the MQTT Message Topic at JMRI Startup</h4>
      <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.15.5</span>
      <p>The sample script <a href=
      "../../../../../jython/MQTT/SetMqttPrefix.py">SetMqttPrefix.py</a> shows how to set object
      type-specific topic components at JMRI startup. Note that any changes should be made at
      startup time before creating any Turnout objects, i.e. the script must be run before any
      panel files are loaded. Changing the prefix only affects Turnouts that are created after the
      change.</p>

      <h4>Changing MQTT Default Parameters</h4>
      <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.21.3</span>
      <p>Two parameters used in MQTT processing can be reset via scripts.</p>

      <p><a href="https://mosquitto.org/man/mqtt-7.html" target="_blank">MQTT Quality of
      Service</a> indicates to the MQTT message broker how to handle message delivery and receipt.
      Allowable values are 0, 1, and 2. JMRI uses QoS level 1 (broker will deliver message at least
      once) by default.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-8-retained-messages/" target=
      "_blank">Retained Messages</a> indicates to the MQTT message broker whether to retain the
      last message received for a certain topic. JMRI publishes messages with the retain option on.
      This allows any new subscriber to automatically receive the last message send to a topic
      (often the state of a JMRI object) when that new subscriber starts up.</p>

      <p>Both of these parameters can be changed using the <a href=
      "../../../../../jython/MQTT/SetMqttOptions.py">SetMqttOptions.py</a> script.</p>

      <p><a href="#top"><em><small>[Go to top of page]</small></em></a>
      </p>
      <!-- *=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*= -->

      <h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
      <a href="http://test.mosquitto.org" target="_blank"><img src=
      "https://mosquitto.org/stickers/mosquitto-mono.png" alt="Mosquitto logo" height="80" width=
      "80" class="floatRight"></a>
      <p>If you don't already run an MQTT broker and want to test with this connection type, you
      can use a publicly-available (non-JMRI) test server. Enter "test.mosquitto.org" as the Host
      Name on the Preferences Connections page to connect to the host provided by mosquitto.org
      (for more information, type <a href="https://test.mosquitto.org" target=
      "_blank">test.mosquitto.org</a> into a browser.</p>

      <p>You can also install the <a href="https://mosquitto.org/download/" target=
      "_blank">mosquitto tools</a> on your own machine. You can then publish and subscribe to
      messages from JMRI.</p>

      <pre>
    mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -v -t '/trains/#'
</pre>to subscribe and print all JMRI messages as they are published. To publish messages for JMRI
to pick up:

      <pre>
    mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t /trains/track/turnout/123 -r -m "CLOSED"
    mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t /trains/track/turnout/123 -r -m "THROWN"
</pre>These commands can be run on the same machine as JMRI, or on a separate machine.
      <p>You can also install a copy of the mosquitto broker by typing:</p>

      <pre>
    mosquitto -v
</pre>and enter "localhost" as the Host Name on the JMRI Connection for MQTT. If you are using
version 2.0 of mosquitto or later, you will need to provide a "configuration file":

      <pre>
    mosquitto -c "[location of your config file]/mosquitto.conf"
</pre>Include at least the following lines in mosquitto.conf:

      <pre>
    log_type all                 #Equivalent to setting -v (verbose mode)
    listener 1883                #To ensure listening on the appropriate port
    allow_anonymous true         #Allows JMRI to subscribe without an ID or password
</pre>See the <a href="https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-conf-5.html" target="_blank">mosquitto
documentation</a> for more information.
      <p>There are also MQTT tools available for <a href=
      "https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+app+store+mqtt&amp;oq=apple+app+store+mqtt" target=
      "_blank">iOS devices</a> and <a href=
      "https://play.google.com/store/search?q=mqtt&amp;c=apps&amp;authuser" target="_blank">Android
      devices</a> that can be useful for monitoring, testing and operating your layout.</p>
