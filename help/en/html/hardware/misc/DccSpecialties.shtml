      several powerful controllers for model railroads. Their two switch motor controllers are
      called the <a href="http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/hare-ng.htm">Hare</a> and <a href=
      "http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/wabbit_review.htm">Wabbit</a>. They also make an
      intelligent block detector called the <a href=
      "http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/bwatcher.htm">Block Watcher</a>, and the powerful
      <a href="http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/powershield_x.htm">PSX</a> and <a href=
      "http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/powershield_x.htm">PSX-AR</a> power controllers.
      <p>These can do a lot of things, but it can require some work to configure them.</p>

      <h3>Third Party info</h3>

      <p>Brett Scott and Denny Whitaker have written JMRI scripts to assist with programming these,
      and provided a nice <a href="http://www.mgbrr.org/Tips">writeup</a> of how to use them. The
      writeup also covers how they document their layout, and discusses the pros and cons of
      several ways of connecting the Hare and Wabbit.</p>

      <p>You can download <a href="https://jmri.org/jython/dccspecialties/">their scripts</a> from
      the JMRI website, and it also available in the <a href="https://jmri.org/jython">sample
      scripts directory</a> in the <a href="https://jmri.org/download/">JMRI downloads</a>.</p>
