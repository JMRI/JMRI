      http://www.dccspecialties.com/ DCC Specialties makes ( made? )
      several powerful controllers for model railroads. Their two switch motor controllers are
      called the http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/hare-ng.htm Hare and 
      http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/wabbit_review.htm Wabbit. They also make an
      intelligent block detector called the 
      http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/bwatcher.htm Block Watcher, and the powerful
      http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/powershield_x.htm PSX and 
      http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/powershield_x.htm PSX-AR power controllers.
      <p>These can do a lot of things, but it can require some work to configure them.</p>

      <p>Brett Scott and Denny Whitaker have written JMRI scripts to assist with programming these,
      and provided a nice <a href="https://mgbrr.org/Tips">writeup</a> of how to use them. The
      writeup also covers how they document their layout, and discusses the pros and cons of
      several ways of connecting the Hare and Wabbit.</p>

      <p>You can download <a href="https://www.jmri.org/jython/dccspecialties/">their scripts</a> from
      the JMRI website, and it also available in the <a href="https://www.jmri.org/jython/">sample
      scripts directory</a> in the <a href="https://www.jmri.org/download/">JMRI downloads</a>.</p>
