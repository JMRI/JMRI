      "http://www.dccspecialties.com/">DCC Specialties</a> makes
      several powerful controllers for model railroads. Their two
      switch motor controllers are called the <a href=
      "http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/hare-ng.htm">Hare</a>
      and <a href=
      "http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/wabbit_review.htm">Wabbit</a>.
      They also make an intelligent block detector called the
      <a href=
      "http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/bwatcher.htm">Block
      Watcher</a>, and the powerful <a href=
      "http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/powershield_x.htm">PSX</a>
      and <a href=
      "http://www.dccspecialties.com/products/powershield_x.htm">PSX-AR</a>
      power controllers.

      <p>These can do a lot of things, but it can require some work
      to configure them. <a name="documentation" id=

      <h2>Documentation</h2>

      <h3>Third Party info</h3>

      <p>Brett Scott and Denny Whitaker have written JMRI scripts
      to assist with programming these, and provided a nice
      <a href="http://www.mgbrr.org/tips.html#jmri">writeup</a> of
      how to use them. The writeup also covers how they document
      their layout, and discusses the pros and cons of several ways
      of connecting the Hare and Wabbit.</p>

      <p>You can download <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/jython/dccspecialties/">their scripts</a>
      from the JMRI web site, and it also available in the <a href=
      "https://jmri.org/jython">sample scripts directory</a> in the
      <a href="https://jmri.org/download/">JMRI downloads</a>.</p>
