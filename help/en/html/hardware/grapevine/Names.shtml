      <h2>Naming</h2>
      Individual inputs (Sensors) and outputs
      (Turnouts and Lights) in JMRI are accessed via names. For
      information on the general scheme, please see the <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">naming page</a> in the
      <a href="../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical
      documentation</a>.

      <h3>Adding an item to the table</h3>
      <p>When you add an item to one of the tables, many times you only
      have to fill in the numbers to have JMRI construct
      the complete system name.<br>
      Here's a summary, split up for
      outputs (eg. Turnouts) and inputs (eg. Sensors):</p>

      <!-- this table is an excerpt from the table in the help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml
      based on information from the Hardware help pages
      by Egbert Broerse @silverailscolo July 2017 -->

      <p>For Grapevine systems, all names start with a system
      letter of "G". After that, there's a <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#type">type letter</a>, then
      a node number and a pin number.</p>

      <p>The pin number is either three numeric digits ("101",
      "324", "004"), or starts with a lower-case alphabetic
      character ("p12", "s1"). See the sections on inputs and
      outputs below for the specific meanings of these various
      formats.</p>

      <p>The Node number precedes the pin number. If it's helpful,
      you can think of the node number as being the "thousands"
      part of the combined number, and the pin number as the lower
      three digits.</p>

      <p>For example, the 1st Grapevine Sensor input pin on node 23
      would be named GS23001 or GS23p1. The 5th Turnout on node 2
      would be GT2005.</p>

      <h3>Node Numbering</h3>Each Grapevine Node has a number, from
      1 to 127.

      <p>Before you can access the Node in JMRI, you have to define
      it to the program. You can do this either from the <a href=
      "../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Preferences
      window</a> (under Edit in the main menu) or using the
      <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/grapevine/nodeconfig/NodeConfigFrame.shtml">
      Configure Nodes</a> tool in the <strong>Grapevine</strong>
      menu.</p>

      <h3>Inputs</h3>Grapevine Nodes have a number of possible
      input types:

      <dl>
        <dt>Parallel Inputs</dt>

        <dd>
          There are eight three-pin connectors on a Grapevine Node
          that can be used as general inputs. These Sensors are
          referenced as 001 to 008. They can also be referenced in a
          shorter format (where the three full digits are not
          required) as p1 through p8.

          <p>In addition, there are eight additional pins in the
          14-pin connector that can be referenced as Sensors 009 to
          016 or p9 through p16, where the "p" indicates parallel
          input.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Serial Occupancy Sensor Cards</dt>

        <dd>
          Advanced serial occupancy sensor cards (ASCs) can be
          attached to each Node. Each one senses occupancy on up to
          eight track segments, and up to three can be attached to
          a node. In addition, "occupancy" and "motion" are
          separately detected.

          <p>The occupancy on these cards are numbered
          sequentially, starting with 101. The motion Sensors are
          also numbered sequentially, starting with 201. This means
          that 101 and 201 sense "occupancy" and "motion" on the
          1st connector of the 1st card, respectively, 109 and 209
          are the occupancy and motion sensors on the first
          connector of the second card, etc.</p>

          <p>These can also be referenced in a shorter form via the
          prefix letter "a", ASD occupancy sensor, or "m" for ASD
          motion sensor, and the 1-24 number of the connector.</p>

          <p>Examples, all for node 22:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>GS22a1 or GS22101 is the occupancy sensor for the
            first block input on the 1st ASC.<br>
            GS22m1 or GS22201 is the corresponding motion sensor
            for the first block input on the 1st ASC.</li>

            <li>GS22a9 or GS22109 is the occupancy sensor for the
            first block input on the 2nd ASC.<br>
            GS22m9 or GS22209 is the corresponding motion sensor
            for the first block input on the 2nd ASC.</li>

            <li>GS22a24 or GS124 is the occupancy sensor for the
            8th block input on the 3rd ASC.<br>
            GS22m24 or GS224 is the corresponding motion sensor for
            the 8th block input on the 3rd ASC.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Older Occupancy Sensors</dt>

        <dd>Nodes may also have older serial occupancy detectors
        attached. If you have one of these, the Sensors will appear
        as 021 through 036. These can also be referenced as "s1"
        through "s16".</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Outputs</h3>

      <p>Each Grapevine node can have up to four output cards
      attached to it. (Some of the Grapevine and ProTrak
      documentation refers to these as four "banks".) The outputs
      on the first card are referenced starting with 101, and can
      go up to 124 depending on the type of card. The outputs on
      the second card start at 201 and go up to 224. The third and
      fourth cards start at 301 and 401 respectively.</p>

      <p>If it helps, you can think of the "hundreds" digit as the
      card or bank number, and the lowest two digits as the
      connector number.</p>

      <p>Each of these can be used as a JMRI <a href=
      "../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnout</a>, <a href=
      "../../tools/Lights.shtml">Light</a> or <a href=
      "../../tools/Signals.shtml">Signal Head</a>.</p>

      <h4>Turnouts</h4>

      <p>Grapevine outputs can be use to control turnout switch
      motors. In that case, they should be referenced as JMRI
      <a href="../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnouts</a>, with names
      like GT98201 for the 1st output from the 2nd driver card on
      node 98.</p>

      <h4>Lights</h4>

      <p>Grapevine outputs can be used to control lights on the
      layout, in which case they should be referenced as JMRI
      <a href="../../tools/Lights.shtml">Lights</a>. System names
      for lights start with GL, for example GL54102 for the 2nd
      output on the 1st driver card on node 54.</p>

      <h4>Signals</h4>

      <p>To use a Grapevine output as a JMRI <a href=
      "../../tools/Signaling/index.shtml">Signal</a>, capable of
      displaying red/yellow/green and associated flashing Aspects,
      you must define it as a "Grapevine Signal Head" using the
      <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
      button in the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalHeadTable.shtml">
      Signal Head Table</a>. Give it a system name that starts with
      "GH", and is followed by the node and output numbers.</p>

      <p>For example, to use the 3rd connector on the 2nd driver
      card on node 1, define a Grapevine Signal Head using system
      name GH1203. <a name="documentation" id=
      "documentation"></a></p>
