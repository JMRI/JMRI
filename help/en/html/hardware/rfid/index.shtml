      <h1>Hardware Support: RFID Readers</h1>
      <em>RFID support in JMRI is rapidly evolving; the actual code might be ahead or
      behind the documentation on any given day.</em>

      <p>JMRI provides support for general JMRI <a href=
      "../../tools/Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a> and <a href=
      "../../tools/Reporters.shtml">Reporters</a> in terms of RFID
      Reader "events". <a name="hardware" id="hardware"></a></p>

      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <h3>Protocols</h3>JMRI supports several different RFID Reader
      Protocols:

      <ul>
        <li>CORE-ID / ID-Innovations - since version 2.11.4</li>

        <li>Olimex MOD-RFID125 - since v 3.9.2</li>

        <li>Olimex MOD-RFID1356MIFARE - since v 4.7.5</li>

        <li>Parallax - since v 3.9.2</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Choose the appropriate Protocol when setting the
      Preferences.</p>

      <p>JMRI also supports up to 8 individual readers connected
      via a Concentrator. Right now, the only supported
      Concentrator is that from <a href="../can/cbus/Details.shtml#c7">MERG</a>, and then only for readers
      using the CORE-ID protocol.<br>
      
      Select "MERG Concentrator" for the "Adapter" on the
      Connections tab in the JMRI Preferences. </p>

      <h2><a name="connecting"
      id="connecting">Connecting</a></h2>
      

      <h3>Wiring</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Direct serial connections have been supported since
        JMRI 2.11.4</li>

        <li>Network connections are targeted for the JMRI 4.1.2
        release series.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Settings</h3><a href="images/RFID_Preferences.png"><img src=
      "images/RFID_Preferences.png" align="right" height="220" width=
      "430" alt="JMRI RFID Preferences"></a>

      <p>You configure JMRI's connection to your RFID hardware in
      JMRI's Preferences.<br>
      It appears as "RFID" in the System Manufacturer drop-down
      list.</p>
      <p>The "Baud rate" advanced connection setting is typically not critical 
      for USB-connected RFID connections so it may be "greyed out" to indicate 
      that it is not selectable.</p>

      <h3>Reader Configuration</h3>
      <h4>Olimex readers</h4>
      <p>Olimex MOD-RFID125 and MOD-RFID1356MIFARE readers must be operating in "CDC" 
          mode.  This mode is typically configured using a pushbutton on the reader.</p>
      
      <h3>Naming</h3>

      <p>The <a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">system
      letter</a> for RFID connections is "F". Details of RFID event
      and object names are described below. 
      <!-- , with technical details on a <a href="Names.shtml">separate page</a> --></p>

      <p>JMRI associates RFID events with individual JMRI objects
      (Sensors, Reporters, etc.) via System Names. A System Name
      like "<code>FSA</code>" defines a Sensor that follows the "A"
      reader, whereas a System Name like "<code>FRB</code>" defines
      a Reporter that follows the "B" reader.</p>

      <h3>Sensors</h3>

      <p>RFID readings coming into JMRI applications can be
      accessed via JMRI Sensor objects. The Sensor's 
      <!-- <a href="Names.shtml">system name</a> -->System Name
      determines which RFID Reader it corresponds to.</p>

      <p>A Sensor is defined by two events: The one that sets it
      ACTIVE, and the one that sets it INACTIVE. When an RFID Tag
      is within the proximity of an RFID Reader, the associated
      sensor is ACTIVE; outside of these times it is INACTIVE. You
      create Sensors using the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorAddEdit.shtml">
      Add...</a> button on the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor
      Table</a>.</p>

      <h3>Reporters</h3>

      <p>RFID readings coming into JMRI applications can also be
      accessed via JMRI Reporter objects. The Reporter's 
      <!-- <a href="Names.shtml">system name</a> -->system name
      determines which RFID Reader it corresponds to.</p>

      <p>A Reporter can contain arbitrary information, unlike a
      Sensor which is only ACTIVE or INACTIVE. Each Reporter is
      associated with some specific source of information on the
      layout, and makes that devices information available to the
      rest of JMRI.</p>

      <p>When an RFID Reader reports that a specific tag has been
      seen, the corresponding Reporter will contain details of the
      specific <a href="../../tools/IdTags.shtml">IdTag</a> seen.
      This then enables other JMRI tools to react to this
      information.</p>

      <h4>Reporter Table</h4>

      <p>The <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ReporterTable.shtml">Reporter
      Table</a> provides easy access to the contents of all
      Reporters that JMRI knows about. JMRI automatically creates
      Reporter objects for devices discovered on the layout.<br>
      There's also an <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ReporterAddEdit.shtml">
      "Add..." button</a> for manually creating your own internal
      Reporters.</p>

      <h4>Displaying Reporter Values on Panels</h4>

      <p>A Reporter's value can be displayed on a Control Panel via either the 
      <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelEditor.shtml">Panel Editor </a> or the
      <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/ControlPanelEditor.shtml"> Control Panel Editor</a>.
      These are the steps for using Panel Editor:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Panel Editor window for your panel and select "Reporter" from the pulldown menu under
        "Select the type of icon to Add to Panel."</li>

        <li>Select the Reporter from the list, or add a new one by typing the desired System Name.</li>

        <li>Click the button to "Add to Panel." The Reporter icon will be placed on the Panel. You will see
        "&lt;no report&gt;" displayed.  Use the Reporter Table to change the value.</li>

        <li>You can drag the icon to where you want by right-clicking your mouse and dragging the value.</li>

        <li>The pop-up menu on the icon will let you change the
        formatting.</li>
        
      </ul>
      
      <p>Note that a Reporter cannot be displayed directly on a Layout Editor Panel.  Instead, use a script
      such as <a href="../../../../../jython/ReporterFormatter.py">ReporterFormatter.py</a> to parse the 
      information in the Reporter and copy what you want into a <a href="../../tools/Memories.shtml">Memory.</a>
      That Memory can then be displayed on a Layout Editor Panel.
