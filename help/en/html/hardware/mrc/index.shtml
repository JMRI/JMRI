<h1>Hardware Support: MRC/GaugeMaster Prodigy Advanced<sup>2</sup></h1>
<p>
Please download the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/download/index.shtml">latest JMRI release</a>
to get the most recent version of JMRI's MRC/GaugeMaster support.
Support for MRC Prodigy is available starting with
<a href="http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri3.9.1.shtml">JMRI version 3.9.1</a>.

<p>
In the UK the MRC systems is rebranded, rebadged and sold by Gaugemaster.  
The two systems are exactly the same in operation and components.

<a name="connecting"></a><h2>Connecting</h2>
<p>
JMRI can connect to an MRC Prodigy Advanced<sup>2</sup> command station 
via the USB Computer interface (MRC:1516 or Gaugemaster:DCC55).
This has been tested with the wired and wireless versions of the interface.
<p>
JMRI should be able to support all of the MRC Prodigy range of systems,
however it has only been tested and developed with the Advanced<sup>2</sup>.

  <h3>Settings</h3>
  <p>
		To configure the connection:
		<ul>
			<li>Open the JMRI "Preferences" under the "Edit" menu,
			<li>Select "MRC" as the System Manufacturer.
			<li>Select "Serial" as the System Connection.
			<li>Select the Serial Port associated with the system.
			<li>Select the Cab Address that will be allocated to the interface.<br>
			Please note that this must be unique and not used by any other handset, if you are to use a number above 8, then you must refer to Prodigy instructions to ensure that the system is configured to address the cab correctly
			<li>Click "Save".
		</ul>
		
		<p>Programming, Turnout, Throttle and Power support is available for 
		a JMRI-connected Prodigy unit.

		<h3>Programming Decoders</h3>
		JMRI provides full support for the reading/writing of decoders on the Programming along with the ability
		to write changes to a decoder "On the Main".
		<p>
		Please note that the Prodigy Command Station will automatically determine the programming mode (ie. Direct Byte/Direct Bit/Paged).
		
		<h3>Throttles</h3>
		The JMRI interface supports both 28 &amp; 128 speed steps and all 28 functions.<br>
		If another handset has control of the same Locomotive that a JMRI Throttle has, the changes made by the second Throttle 
		will be reflected on the JMRI Throttle.
		<p><b>Support for 14 speed steps has NOT been included.<br>
		Consisting is NOT currently supported</b>
		
		<h3>Turnouts</h3>
		MRC-connected Turnouts have System Names like "MRT123", where "MR"
		is the name for MRC System, "T" means Turnout, and
		"123" is the address.<p>
		
		<h3>MRC Routes</h3>
		Triggering of MRC system Routes is supported in JMRI. This is done by adding a 
		Turnout with the Route number + 1000, eg.
		for MRC Route 15, you would add a JMRI Turnout with an address of MRT1015.
		<p>
		JMRI does not support editing/adding/removal of system Routes stored in the MRC.
