JMRI: MRC/GaugeMaster Prodigy Advanced<sup>2</sup>
</h1>
In the UK the MRC systems is rebranded, rebadged and sold by Gaugemaster.  
The two systems are exactly the same in operation and components.
<p>
JMRI can connect to an MRC Prodigy Advanced<sup>2</sup> command station 
via the USB Computer interface (MRC:1516 or Gaugemaster:DCC55).
<p>
The JMRI should be able to support all of the MRC Prodigy range of systems
however it has only been tested and developed with the Advanced<sup>2</sup>
<p>
To configure the connection:
<ul>
<li>Open the JMRI "Preferences" under the "Edit" menu,
<li>Select "MRC" as the Manufacturer.
<li>Select "Serial" as the System Connection.
<li>Select the Serial Port associated with the system.
<li>Select the Cab Address that will be allocated to the interface. <br>Please note that this must be unique and not used by any other handset, if you are to use a number above 8, then you must refer to Prodigy instructions to ensure that the system is configured to address the cab correctly
<li>Click "Save".
</ul>

<p>
Programming, Turnout, Throttle and Power support is available for 
a JMRI-connected Prodigy unit.
<p>
<h2>Programming</h2>
There is full support for the reading/writing of decoders on the Programming along with the ability
to write changes to a decoder on the Main.
<p>
Please note that the Prodigy Command Station will automatically determine the programming mode (ie Direct Byte/Direct Bit/Paged).
<H2>Throttles</H2>
The JMRI interface supports both 28 & 128 speed steps and all 28 functions. <br>
If another handset has control of the same loco that a JMRI throttle has, the changes made by the second throttle 
will be reflected on the JMRI throttle.
Support for 14 speed steps has not been included.
<p><b> Consisting is NOT currently supported</b>

<H2>Turnouts</H2>
MRC-connected turnouts have names like "MRT123", where "MR"
is the system name for MRc System, "T" means turnout, and
"123" is the address.<p>

<h2>MRC Routes</h2>
Triggering of MRC system routes are supported in JMRI, this is done by adding a 
turnout with the route number + 1000 eg.
For system route 15, you would add a turnout with an address of 1015.
<p>
There is no support for editing/adding/removal of system routes in the MRC.
<p>
Support for MRC Prodigy was first available in <br>
