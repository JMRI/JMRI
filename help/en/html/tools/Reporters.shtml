        <h1>JMRI: Reporters Documentation</h1>

        <h2>What is a Reporter?</h2>

        <p>A Reporter is JMRI's way of representing information reported back from the layout.</p>

        <p>A Reporter can contain arbitrary text, unlike a Sensor which is only ACTIVE or
        INACTIVE. Each Reporter is associated with a specific source of information on the
        layout and makes that device's information available to the rest of JMRI.</p>
        
        <p>Reporters are created automatically in certain cases, such as when an 
        <a href="../hardware/rfid/GettingStartedWithRFID.shtml">RFID Reader</a> sees
        a tag referencing a specific reader for the first time. For all other uses, they must be
        created manually by updating the <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ReporterTable.shtml">
        Reporter Table</a> or via a <a href="scripting/index.shtml">script</a>.

        <p>Reporters are populated automatically as noted below or manually by updating the
        <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ReporterTable.shtml">Reporter Table</a>,
        using a <a href="logixng/reference/chapter5.shtml#digital_action_item">LogixNG</a>
        or via a <a href="scripting/index.shtml">script</a>.
        
        <h2>The Reporter Table</h2>

        <p>The <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ReporterTable.shtml">Reporter Table</a>
        provides easy access to the contents of all Reporters that JMRI knows about. 
        JMRI automatically creates Reporter objects for certain connection types
        (currently <a href="../hardware/loconet/Addressing.shtml#transponding">LocoNet 
        transponders</a> and <a href="../hardware/rfid/index.shtml">RFID readers</a>).
        There is also an <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ReporterAddEdit.shtml">"Add..." button</a>
        for creating your own Reporters, either "internal" or for any 
        <a href="../hardware/mqtt/index.shtml#objects">MQTT connections</a>.</p>

        <h2>Creating and Updating Reporters</h2>

        <p>Reporters can be created manually by direct entry or via script into the Reporter Table. For some hardware
        reporters, Reporters are automatically created in the Reporter Table.  Current Report is populated and cleared by some 
        implementations (including being cleared when the same reported object appears in another Reporter).
        For example, for an RFID Reporter, if an ID tag is seen at second reporter, it will
        be removed from the first reporter.  For other types of Reporters (e.g. Internal REporters), this 
        must be done manually or via a script. </p>
        
        <p>Last Report is always set equal to the Current Report and is only changed by a new (non-blank)
        Current Report.  This is to handle the situation where a report may not be able to sent a timely report
        but it is useful to know the last report received.  [Advanced: See the <a href="../../../../JavaDoc/doc/jmri/Reporter.html">
        Java documentation</a></p>

        <p>The following table provides details for implementations as of JMRI Release 5.3.7 [Asterisk (*) indicates 
        additional information below the table.  Number sign (#) indicates information that had not been verified when
        this page was updated.] [Advanced Reference Info: Code Source is the java program defining
        this type of Reporter. See <a href="../../../../JavaDoc/doc/jmri/doc-files/Reporter.png">this diagram.

        <p>Additional information:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Digitrax Transponding: </strong>If you are using LocoNet (Digitrax) transponding, the Reporter will
        automatically be populated with information from Digitrax <a href=
        "http://www.digitrax.com/prd_statdec_bdl168.php">BDL168</a> cards with <a href=
        "http://www.digitrax.com/prd_statdec_rx4.php">RX4 transponding sensors</a>. When the BDL168
        reports that a decoder has been seen in a transponding block or is no longer visible in
        the block, the corresponding Reporter will display messages like "1234 enter" and "1234
        exits".</li>
               
        <li><strong>OpenLCB/LCC: </strong> Any Event Report message falling into the range specified by the System Name
        will update the reporter. This will specify a DCC address and an orientation, or that the locomotive left.
        When the OpenLCB reporter is updated, JMRI will automatically create a Tag with the given DCC address in the 
        <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/RailComTable.shtml">RailCom table</a>
        if there isn't one. The Tag will show its last seen location as the given Reporter. Caveat: it is not possible
        to differentiate long and short DCC addresses in the Tag entries, so 3L and 3S will be showing the same Tag.</li>
        
        <li><strong>RFID Connection: </strong>If you are using RFID readers and have set up an RFID Connection, JMRI will automatically
        create and update Reporters corresponding to the name of the reader and the UID of the RFID
        tag seen by the named reader.  The Reporter will automatically clear the "Current Report" field
        after 2 seconds.</li>

        </ul>



        <h2>Displaying Reporter Values on Panels</h2>
        
        <p> Reporter contents can be displayed on panels using several different mechanisms:
        
        <h3>Display on a Panel using Panel Editor</h3>
        <a href="images/AddReportertoPanel.png"><img src="images/AddReportertoPanel.png" height=
        "146" width="166" class="floatRight" alt="reporter values"></a>
           
        <p>A Reporter's value can be displayed on a Control Panel via an icon. To do this:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>On the Panel Editor window for your Panel, find the "Add Reporter" button.</li>

          <li>In the text box next to that button, type the user name or System Name of the desired
          Reporter.</li>

          <li>Click the "Add to Panel" button. The Reporter icon will be placed on your Panel. If
          it's not visible, that might be because the value is currently blank; use the Reporter
          Table to change the value to something that will be visible.</li>

          <li>You can drag the icon to where you want it in the usual way.</li>

          <li>The pop-up menu on the icon will let you change the formatting.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Display on a Layout Panel as a Block Value</h3>
        <p>Reporters can be associated with 
        <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/BlockTable.shtml">layout blocks</a>.  When the
        <em>current report</em> of the Reporter changes, that value will be put into (or removed from)
        the <em>block value</em>. Block values can be displayed using the Layout Panel Editor.</p>

        <h3>Display Memory Variables containing Reporter contents</h3>        
        <p>Using <a href="./logixng/reference/chapter5.shtml#digital_action_item">LogixNG's Reporter action </a>,
        Reporter contents from fields Current Report, Last Report, and State can be copied to
        a memory variable or a LogixNG local variable.  Memory variables can then be display on any type of Panels
        using the appropriate panel editor.</p>
 

        <h2>Saving Reporters in Layout Configuration</h2>

        <p>Reporters are kept in your <em>layout configuration</em>, along with Turnouts, Sensors,
        Signal Heads, control panel setup etc. "Report" and "Last Report" field contents are not
        stored. See <a href="../apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">Loading and Storing Your Work</a>.</p>
