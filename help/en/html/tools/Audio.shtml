      <h1>JMRI: Audio Documentation</h1>JMRI Audio objects hold
      information about sounds that can be played-back by the
      computer.

      <h2>The Audio Table</h2>The <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/AudioTable.shtml">Audio
      Table</a> lets you see what Audio objects have been defined,
      and what information they currently contain.<br>
      <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/AudioTable.jpg"><img src=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/AudioTable.jpg" height=
      "178" width="420"></a>

      <h4>Audio Table controls</h4>

      <p>Below the Audio Table are two buttons, named "Add
      Source..." and "Add Buffer..." to <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/AudioAddEdit.shtml">create
      new Audio objects</a>.</p>

      <h2>Audio Objects</h2>The JMRI audio framework consists of
      three distinct types of object:

      <ul>
        <li>Audio Listeners</li>

        <li>Audio Buffers</li>

        <li>Audio Sources</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Audio Listener</h4>The Audio Listener defines where the
      person hearing the sounds is located.

      <p><a href="images/EditAudioListener.png"><img src=
      "images/EditAudioListener.png" height="187" width=
      "122"></a></p>

      <p>The defined listener position is then used to calculate
      the actual pan and gain of each audio source when played
      back.</p>

      <p>The orientation settings define the co-ordinate system in
      use. The default values transpose to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>x - left-to-right (-ve to +ve)</li>

        <li>y - front-to-back (-ve to +ve)</li>

        <li>z - down-to-up (-ve to +ve)</li>
      </ul>With the default position, 'y' values would be positive,
      measured from the front-edge of the layout and 'x' values to
      be negative to the left of the layout centre-line and
      positive to the right of the layout centre-line. Positive 'z'
      values would be measured from layout level upwards.

      <p>Unless modified by changing 'Meters per unit', all
      distance and velocity units are measured in real-world
      meters.</p>

      <p>Only one Audio Listener can exist, and it is already
      present in the Audio Table where it may be configured by
      clicking its <b>Edit</b> button.</p>

      <h4>Audio Buffers</h4>An Audio Buffer holds the actual sound
      sample data.

      <p><a href="images/AddEditAudioBuffer.png"><img src=
      "images/AddEditAudioBuffer.png" height="93" width=
      "176"></a></p>

      <p>To load an Audio Buffer with sound data, click the
      'Browse...' button and select the appropriate '.wav'
      file.</p>

      <p>One Audio Buffer object can be used by many Audio
      Sources.</p>

      <h4>Audio Sources</h4>An Audio Source controls the playback
      of sound sample data and controls the position.

      <p><a href="images/AddEditAudioSource.png"><img src=
      "images/AddEditAudioSource.png" height="241" width=
      "123"></a></p>

      <p>To actually play a sound, an Audio Source must be linked
      to an existing Audio Buffer - choose one from the drop-down
      list. Buffers are allowed to be shared between Audio Sources,
      in which case they will be played back independently.</p>

      <p>As with the Audio Listener, an Audio Source should be
      positioned in 3d-space. If required to 'move' whilst playing,
      set the velocity in x, y and z directions. This will move the
      position of the Audio Source in the direction and speed
      specified by the velocity vector at the defined rate while
      the Audio Source is playing.</p>

      <p><em>Example:</em> An 'x' value of 2 will move the Audio
      Source 2 units (meters) per second towards the right whilst
      playing.</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> The Audio Source position is only relevant
      when bound to a mono buffer - those holding multi-channel
      sounds (i.e. stereo) will not be affected by changes in
      position and played as-is.</p>

      <p>If it is necessary to turn-down the volume of a specific
      Audio Source, this can be achieved by changing the 'Gain'
      setting. Similarly, the pitch can be modified by changing the
      'Pitch' parameter.</p>

      <p>Normal behavior is for the volume of an Audio Source to be
      altered by the distance from the Audio Listener. This
      behavior can be modified by altering the Reference Distance
      and Maximum Distance settings. The Reference Distance
      determines the distance at which the volume will start to
      decrease - at distances smaller than the reference distance,
      the volume of the Audio Source will be as defined by the gain
      setting. The Maximum Distance determines the distance at
      which the volume is zero. Roll-off Factor determines the
      rate-of-change of the gain with respect to distance - larger
      values denote a faster rate-of-change.</p>

      <p>Finally, the fade-in and fade-out times of the Audio
      Source can be defined - these are specified in milli-seconds.
      Fading-in and out of an Audio Source is achieved by using the
      fadeIn and fadeOut methods of the Audio Source; play, stop
      and pause methods do not utilize fade times.</p>

      <p>Unless modified by changing the 'Meters per unit'
      parameter of the Audio Listener, all distance and velocity
      units are measured in real-world meters.</p>

      <h3>Using Audio Objects with Logix</h3>A Logix can be defined
      to control audio objects. Currently, it is possible to play,
      pause, stop, rewind, fade-in and fade-out audio sources.

      <h3>Using Audio Objects with Scripts</h3>You can directly
      manipulate Audio Objects with scripts. There's an <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/jython/AudioExample.py">example script</a>
      in the distribution, along with documentation for the
      <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/audio/AudioBuffer.html">
      AudioBuffer</a>, <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/audio/AudioSource.html">
      AudioSource</a> and <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/audio/AudioListener.html">
      AudioListener</a> classes that control the audio processing.

      <h2>Playing Audio</h2>The JMRI audio framework makes use of
      either of the following audio libraries:

      <ul>
        <li><a href=
        "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-139508.html">JavaSound</a>
        - for basic audio functions (limited to stereo)<br>
        JavaSound is normally available with a Sun Microsystems
        Java Runtime Environment; other vendors, such as OpenJDK,
        do not include JavaSound.</li>

        <li><a href="http://www.openal.org/">OpenAL</a> - for
        full-featured audio functions (including support for up-to
        7.1 surround)<br>
        OpenAL may already be included with your operating
        system:</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>macOS</h4>Those versions of macOS (aka Mac OS X) that are
      suitable for JMRI already have a suitable version of OpenAL
      installed.

      <h4>MS Windows</h4>
      <p>By default, OpenAL will require installing
      on your system. Certain sound cards, notably those
      manufactured by Creative Labs and NVidia, will normally
      already come with suitable OpenAL drivers. If OpenAL is not
      installed, <a href="http://www.openal.org/downloads/">it
      should be downloaded</a> from OpenAL.org and then installed
      on your system.</p>

      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>Depending on the provider of your Linux
      distribution, OpenAL might already be included in the default
      package. If not, the 'libopenal-dev' package should be
      installed using the package manager on your system. For
      Debian-based distributions, this will typically be achieved
      by the command:</p>
      <pre>
      $ sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev
      </pre>

      <p>For Ubuntu, the 'Universe' repository should be enabled.</p>
