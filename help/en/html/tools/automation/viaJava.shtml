      <h2>JMRI: Layout Automation in Java</h2>
      <p>The JMRI library
      provides a very powerful set of tools for automating your
      layout. If the tools built into <a href=
      "../../apps/PanelPro/index.shtml">PanelPro</a> or the
      <a href="../scripting/index.shtml">scripting capability</a>
      aren't sufficient to do what you want, writing your own
      control program certainly will be.</p>

      <p>This page describes the JMRI Java classes that support
      writing "automation" code in Java. That's things like
      operating signals, running trains, and even subtle things
      like changing decoder sound volumes when a train goes into a
      tunnel.</p>

      <p>Note that you can also write your automation code using
      Jython as <a href="../scripting/index.shtml">JMRI
      "scripts"</a>. For many purposes, this can be simpler because
      it's more interactive and has better debugging support. Java
      is really best for large and/or complex cases, or if you're
      writing something that you want to eventually contribute to
      JMRI itself.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt class="left">Introduction</dt>

        <dd class="first">
          <p>The "Automat" class provides an easy way to write Java
          automation for your layout using JMRI.</p>

          <p>The key class is <a href=
          "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/AbstractAutomaton.html">
          AbstractAutomaton</a>, which provides threading support
          to simplify custom automation code.</p>

          <p>Key aspect: These run in a separate thread, so they
          can wait for something to happen while the rest of the
          program proceeds. Effectively, each Automat is a separate
          program running when it needs to.</p>

          <p>There are several examples:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>SampleAutomaton - watches a Sensor, and adjusts the
            state of a Turnout so that it matches the Sensor's
            state.</li>

            <li>SampleAutomaton2 - watches a Sensor, and adjusts
            the momentum of a locomotive decoder using ops-mode
            programming when the sensor state changes.</li>

            <li>SampleAutomaton3 - runs a locomotive back and forth
            on a piece of track by watching two sensors, reversing
            the locomotive when they change state.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Note that they may not do anything useful on your
          railroad, as they have block and locomotive numbers
          hard-coded. They're meant to be examples for your own
          programming, not useful tools.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Controlling Locomotives</dt>

        <dd>
          <p class="example">// get the throttle instance for short
          address 3<br>
          throttle = getThrottle(3, false);</p>

          <p>This code snippet assigns "short address 3" to the
          "throttle" variable (the "false" selects short address;
          long address would have been "true"). If this doesn't
          work for some reason, you'll get a periodic "still
          waiting for throttle" message in the Java window, and the
          program will wait.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Interacting with the user</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>You can put up some message boxes directly from Java,
          but it takes a little code to do it. To simplify it at
          the start, I've added a "MsgFrame" helper class to the
          JMRI library.</p>

          <p>To make a message box, you first make an object of the
          "MsgFrame" class:</p>

          <p class="example">MsgFrame box = new MsgFrame();</p>

          <p>(You can call it whatever you'd like, of course). That
          line should go with the other declarations, e.g. right
          after the "DccThrottle throttle = null;" line.</p>

          <p>Then, inside the test routines, there are a few things
          you can do. To show a message and wait for the user to
          click a "Continue" button, do:</p>

          <p class="example">box.show("my message text goes here",
          true);</p>

          <p>The 2nd argument shows the "Continue button and waits
          if true, and just continues if false. So if you'd like to
          show a status message while the program continues to run,
          do:</p>

          <p class="example">box.show("status message text",
          false);</p>

          <p>If you've done that, you can change the message with
          another "show", or you can make the box go away with:</p>

          <p class="example">box.hide();</p>

          <p>Java actually has to do some work to pop the box and
          draw it. We don't want that to delay the main test
          program, so I've written this helper class to do all that
          kind of work as a 2nd, lower priority. You should be able
          to put messages up on the screen without significantly
          slowing operation down (unless the program waits for the
          "Continue" button to be pressed, of course). And waiting
          for "Continue" to be pressed won't stop the operation of
          the rest of the program.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="left">Running Your Code</dt>

        <dd>
          There are two parts to doing this: Making your Java code
          available to JMRI, and invoking it.

          <p>The easiest way to make your code accessible is to
          make a .jar file and place that in the "lib" directory in
          the JMRI program directory. Alternately, you can create a
          "classes" directory, and compile your Java class into
          that. In that case, it should end up in:</p>
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
classes/MyCode.class
</pre>if you've specified no code in your package, or
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
classes/MyCode.class
</pre>or
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
classes/jmri/jmrit/automat/SampleAutomaton.class
</pre>as an example of how code in a specific package gets stored.

          <p>The easiest way to invoke your code is to use JMRI's
          scripting support. Open a Script Output window (so you
          can see errors) from the Panels menu, then a Script Entry
          window, enter:</p>
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
MyCode().start()
</pre>or
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
import jmri.jmrit.automat
jmri.jmrit.automat.SampleAutomaton().start()
</pre>
          and hit Execute. The 2nd line creates an instance of your
          class and tells it to start running.

          <p>Once you've got that working, you can put that in a
          little script file and invoke it at startup, via a Logix,
          or whenever you desire.</p>
