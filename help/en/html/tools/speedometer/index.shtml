      <h1>Speedometer</h1>

      <p>The JMRI libraries contain a Speedometer tool that you can
      use directly from the screen, or build into your own
      applications</p>

      <p>Before the tool will report the speed, you need to
      configure it.</p>

      <p>To do this, enter Sensor numbers in the three fields. This
      is a number (like "23") for the DCC address of the BDL16,
      DS54, etc. channel that will report when the occupancy
      changes. The simplest way to get the right number is to open
      a "LocoNet Monitor" window, and drop a locomotive onto the
      block you're interested in. You'll see the sensor message,
      complete with number, in the window that looks something like
      this:</p>
      <pre>
   General sensor input report: contact 161 (DS54 20 ch1 Sw  input)
        (BDL16 10 A2) is Lo
</pre>The contact number, 161 in this case, is what you want.

      <p>There are three Sensors so you can have a shorter interval
      for slow speeds and a longer interval for fast speeds. The
      timing is from Sensor 1 to Sensor 2, and from Sensor 1 to
      Sensor 3.</p>

      <p>You also need to select "on entrance" or "on exit" for
      each of the Sensors. This says whether the clock will
      start/stop when the Sensor shows the Block is first
      "Occupied", or when it shows the Block is first
      "Unoccupied".</p>

      <p>You also enter the distance in <em>scale</em> feet between
      the various points. If you're using "on entrance", measure
      using the entrance end of the block.</p>

      <p>Finally, click the "Start" button. The three little red
      dots along the right side of the Speedometer window will
      start changing color to indicate the status of the selected
      Sensors:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Red for "Unknown", no message seen yet</li>

        <li>White for "Unoccupied"</li>

        <li>Green or Yellow for "Occupied"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once you click the Start button, you can't change the
      configuration. Just close that window and open another one.
      You can have multiple Speedometer tool windows open if you'd
      like.</p>
