<h2>Speedometer</h2>

<p>(See also the pages
on the <a href="NCE-Speedometer.shtml">NCE speedometer</A> and the 
<a href="../../hardware/bachrus/index.shtml">Bachrus speedometer</a>)</p>

The JMRI libraries
contain a speedometer tool that you can use directly from the screen,
or build into your own applications
<P>
Before it will report the speed, you need to configure it.
<P>
To do this, enter sensor numbers in the three fields.  This is a 
number (like 23) for the address of the BDL16, DS54, etc channel that 
will report when the occupancy changes.  The simplest way to get the 
right number is to open a "monitor" window, and drop a 
locomotive onto the block you're interested in.  You'll see the 
sensor message, complete with number, in the window that looks 
something like this:
<PRE>
   General sensor input report: contact 161 (DS54 20 ch1 Sw  input)
        (BDL16 10 A2) is Lo
</PRE>
The contact number, 161 in this case, is what you want.
<P>
There are three sensors so you can have a shorter interval for slow 
speeds and a longer interval for fast speeds.  
The timing is from sensor 1 to sensor 2, and from sensor 1 to 
sensor 3.
<P>
You also need to select "on entrance" or "on exit" for each of the 
sensors.  This says whether the clock will start/stop when the sensor 
shows the block is first occupied, or when it shows the block is 
first unoccupied.
<P>
You also enter the distance in _scale_ feet between the various 
points.  If you're using "on entrance", measure using the entrance 
end of the block.
<P>
Finally, click the "Start" button.  The three little red dots along 
the right side will start changing color to indicate the status of 
the selected sensors: Red for "unknown", no message seen yet; White 
for "unoccupied"; Green or yellow for "occupied".
<P>
Once you click the Start button, you can't change the configuration. 
Just close that window and open another one.  You can have multiple 
speedometer tool windows open if you'd like.
