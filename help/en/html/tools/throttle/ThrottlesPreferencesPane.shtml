      <h1>Throttles Preferences</h1>
      <p>The Throttles Preferences pane is accessible from :
        <ul>
          <li>the JMRI preferences window</li>
          <li>the throttle window preferences menu entry</li>
          <li>the throttle and throttles list windows toolbars</li>
        </ul>

        It is composed of two tabs :
        <ul>
          <li>The General tab contains the JMRI throttles user interface preferences.</li>
        <li>The Keyboard controls tab allows to review and set the various keyboard shortcuts
        used by the JMRI throttles user interface. It is also there that the multiplier for mouse wheel + ctrl for speed is set.</li>
        </ul>

        When openned as a single preferences window (not JMRI global preferences), 3 buttons are availble at the bottom :
        <ul>
          <li>Cancel button will close the window and leave current Throttles settings as they are.</li>
          <li>Apply button will apply the current set of preferences and the preferences window will stay open.</li>
          <li>Save button will apply, save current Preferences, and close the Preferences Windows,
          settings will be automatically loaded at next start of JMRI.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>General Panel</h2>
      <img src="images/ThrottlesPreferencesPane.png" alt="Throttle Pref pane">
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">For best user experience, the recommended settings are those illustrated above.</p></span>

      <h3>Use extended throttle</h3>
      This setting will enable/disable all extended throttles features.

      <h3>Save throttles when saving throttle windows layout</h3>
      When saving a throttle layout, all opened throttles layouts are also saved to their respective files.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Warning this does not export to roster file the function name customization if any (see <a href="ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">Export
         current throttle customization to roster menu entry</a>)</span>

      <h3>Use Roster image as background</h3>
      When a roster is selected, the image defined in its <a href="RostersMediaPane.shtml">Media
      Panel</a> will be loaded as a background for the throttle window.<br>
      When this option is enabled and the selected address is 0 or 3, a default image will be
      loaded.

      <h3>Do not scale image</h3>
      When a background image is loaded for current throttle, if enabled, will not scale it before display.

      <h3>Search Roster info when address entered</h3>
      When an address is entered in <a href="BasicThrottleWindow.shtml">the Address Panel</a>, the
      JMRI Roster database will be searched for a matching roster entry (and will hence triggers
      options described above and bellow if they're enabled).

      <h3>Automatic loading Throttle pane preferences when linked to Roster</h3>
      When a Roster is selected, if a matching Throttle definition file exist, JMRI will
      automatically loads it.<br>
      These files are stored in &lt;JMRI Preference Folder&gt;/Throttle/XYZ.xml where XYZ in the
      Roster ID.<br>
      Using the <a href="ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">Save</a> menu entry from the File menu in a
      Throttle Window will create or update these files.

      <h3>Ignore Throttle frame position</h3>
      For old Throttle files that contain Throttle Window position in them, do as described.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: Throttle Windows position are now saved in the
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Throttles Layout</span> backup files (not in the Throttles
      backup files anymore)</span>

      <h3>Hide undefined Roster function buttons</h3>
      When a Roster is selected, the address panels buttons are initialized as defined in the
      Functions Labels panel in DecoderPro Label&Media screen. If this option is enabled, buttons not defined (no text) in
      PanelPro will be automatically hidden in the <a href="BasicThrottleWindow.shtml">Function
      Panel</a>.<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: you can reset Function Buttons visibility in a
      Throttle Window by going to <a href="ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">View Menu and clicking "Show
      all function buttons"</a>.</span>

      <h3>Enable Throttle toolbar</h3>
      This option enables a <a href="ThrottleToolBar.shtml">Toolbar that will show in all Throttle
      Windows</a>.

      <h3>Enable button icons when available</h3>
      When a Roster is selected, the address panels buttons are initialized as defined in the
      Functions Labels panel in DecoderPro Label&Media screen. If this option is enabled, button icons,
      if defined, are loaded and displayed instead of function text.
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Function text still needs to be defined (see Hide undefined Roster function buttons above)</span><br>
      This option will also enable icons instead of text on the directions, idle and stop buttons on the control panel of JMRI throttle windows.

      <h3>Use large speed slider and control buttons</h3>
      If enabled, the speed slider will be drawn much larger and bolder. Will also automaticaly resize the control panel buttons as large as possible.<br>
      Makes everything more readable when standing far away from screen.

      <h3>Hide speed step selector</h3>
      If enabled, as a default, on a new throttle window, in the control panel, the speed step selector is not shown.

      <h3>Steal / Share Options</h3>
      <p>These are system dependent options, and are not be available for all hardware types. Some systems perform automatic steal or sharing, so no option is required.</p>

      <p>The Silent Steal and Silent Share options are independent of the Use Extended Throttle
      setting.<br>
      If both Silent Steal and Silent Share are available, only 1 can be selected at a time.</p>

      <p>Automation scripts and the actual hardware may override these options at any point.
      Although these options are to serve as a guide, they are fully honoured in the main JMRI
      Throttle window.</p>

      <p>WiThrottle connections are only able to support Steal questions, so steal or share
      questions are processed as steal-only.</p>

      <p>See individual hardware documentation for more detail on how these options affect your
      system, eg. <a href="../../hardware/can/cbus/index.shtml#dcc">CBUS® Throttles</a>( CBUS® is a registered trade mark of Dr Michael Bolton)</p>

      <h3>Default throttle file :</h3>
      This file selector allows to define a JMRI Throttle file (xml file created from save as menu in a throttle window) as a default to be loaded
      each time a new throttle is obtained by a JMRI Throttle Window (unless a roster entry is available for that address).<br>
      It allows to define a nicely crafted JMRI Throttle window for any address to be used, particularly, default function names, icons and lockable states.
