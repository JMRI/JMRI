      <h1>Throttles Preferences</h1><img src=
      "images/ThrottlesPreferencesPane.png" alt=
      "Throttle Pref pane" />

      <p>The Throttles Preferences pane is accessible from the
      <a href="ToolsMenuThrottleEntry.shtml">Throttles submenus in
      Tools menu</a>.<br />
      For best experience, the recommended settings are those
      illustrated above.</p>It is recommended to close all Throttle
      panes before applying a new set of Preferences, and then
      reopen them once new settings are applied or saved.

      <ul>
        <li>Cancel button will close the window and leave current
        Throttles settings as they are.</li>

        <li>Apply button will apply the current set of preferences
        and the preferences window will stay open.</li>

        <li>Save button will apply, save current Preferences, and
        close the Preferences Windows, settings will be
        automatically loaded at next start of JMRI.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use extended throttle</h2>This setting will
      enable/disable all extended throttles features.

      <h2>Set Controls transparent</h2>Will set background of
      throttle internal windows transparent, or semi
      transparent.<br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">This feature is known to
      work fine on OS X, but Linux and Windows to be worked on,
      totally varies depending on curent Java interface look'n feel
      (modifiable in JMRI main preferences)</span>

      <h2>Use Roster image as background</h2>When a roster is
      selected, the image defined in its <a href=
      "RostersMediaPane.shtml">Media Panel</a> will be loaded as a
      background for the throttle window.<br />
      When this option is enabled and the selected address is 0 or
      3, a default image will be loaded.

      <h2>Resize window to image size</h2>When a background image
      is loaded for current throttle, will force the Throttle
      Window size to the one of that image.

      <h2>Search Roster info when address entered</h2>When an
      address is entered in <a href="BasicThrottleWindow.shtml">the
      Address Panel</a>, the JMRI Roster database will be searched
      for a matching roster entry (and will hence triggers options
      described above and bellow if they're enabled).

      <h2>Automatic loading Throttle pane preferences when linked
      to Roster</h2>When a Roster is selected, if a matching
      Throttle definition file exist, JMRI will automatically loads
      it.<br />
      These files are stored in &lt;JMRI Preference
      Folder&gt;/Throttle/XYZ.xml where XYZ in the Roster ID.<br />
      Using the <a href="ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">Save</a> menu
      entry from the File menu in a Throttle Window will create or
      update these files.

      <h2>Ignore Throttle frame position</h2>For old Throttle files
      that contain Throttle Window position in them, do as
      described.<br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: Throttle Windows
      position are now saved in the <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">Throttles Layout</span> backup files
      (not in the Throttles backup files anymore)</span>

      <h2>Hide undefined Roster function buttons</h2>When a Roster
      is selected, the address panels buttons are initialized as
      defined in the Functions panel in DecoderPro. If this option
      is enabled, buttons not defined (no text) in PanelPro will be
      automatically hidden in the <a href=
      "BasicThrottleWindow.shtml">Function Panel</a>.<br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: you can reset
      Function Buttons visibility in a Throttle Window by going to
      <a href="ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">View Menu and clicking
      "Show all function buttons"</a>.</span>

      <h2>Enable Throttle toolbar</h2>This option enables a
      <a href="ThrottleToolBar.shtml">Toolbar that will show in all
      Throttle Windows</a>. 
      
      <h2>Steal / Share Options</h2>
      <img src="images/throttles-preferences-steal-share-600x395.png" width="600" height="395" 
        alt= "JMRI Throttle Preferences Silent Steal Share Options" />
      
      <p>These are system dependent options, and are not be available for all hardware types.</p>
      
      <p>Some systems perform automatic steal or sharing, so no option is required.</p>
      
      <p>The Silent Steal and Silent Share options are independent of the Use Extended Throttle setting.</p>
      
      <p>If both Silent Steal and Silent Share are available, only 1 can be selected at a time.</p>
      
      <p>Automation scripts and the actual hardware may override these options at any point. 
      Although these options are to serve as a guide, they are fully honoured in the main JMRI Throttle window.</p>
      
      <p>WiThrottle connections are only able to support Steal questions, 
      so steal or share questions are processed as steal-only.</p>
      
      <p>See individual hardware documentation for more detail on how these options affect
      your system, eg. <a href="../../hardware/can/cbus/index.shtml#dcc">MERG CBUS Throttles</a></p>
