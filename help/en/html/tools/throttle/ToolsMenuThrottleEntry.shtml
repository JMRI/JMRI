      <h2>New Throttle...</h2>
      Create a <a href="BasicThrottleWindow.shtml">new Throttle window</a> with one empty and
      available Throttle inside.
      <h2>Save Throttle Layout...</h2>
      Save current Throttles windows layout, inner Throttles as well, and Throttle List window
      properties.<br>

      <h2>Load Throttle Layout...</h2>
      Load a throttles windows layout, as defined above.<br>
      Will also load Throttle Layouts from older versions of JMRI (&lt;2.7.9).

      <hr>

      <h2>Save As Default Throttle Layout</h2>
      Save current throttle layout as &lt;JMRI Preferences
      folder&gt;/throttleJMRI_ThrottlePreference.xml
      <h2>Load Default Throttle Layout</h2>
      Load &lt;JMRI Preferences folder&gt;/throttleJMRI_ThrottlePreference.xml if it exists.<br>

      <h3>Merging Throttle Windows</h3>

      <p>Throttle layout files can consist of a single Throttle pane (to control a single
      Locomotive or consist address), or may contain multiple Throttle panes. In either case, when
      opening a Throttle Layout file, JMRI will check to see if any existing active Throttle panes
      are already open. If none are found, then the file is opened just like a simple layout
      opening (explained above).</p>

      <p>However, when one or more Throttle panes are already open on the screen, the program will
      open up the following dialog box:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: xx-small;"><img src="images/jmri035.jpg" title=
      "Merge Dialog Box" alt="" height="125" width="354"><br>
      Figure 4-5: Merge Dialog Box</p>
      with 3 buttons:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Merge</strong> - leaves the currently active open Throttle panes in place and
        in addition opens the Throttle(s) contained in the chosen layout file.</li>

        <li><strong>Replace</strong> - closes the currently active open Throttle pane(s) and opens
        up the Throttle pane(s) defined in the chosen layout file.</li>

        <li><strong>Cancel</strong> - cancels the "Open" request and closes this dialog.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="important">Note: Do not confuse the action that is occurring here with any attempts
      to overwrite your saved throttle layout files. The above actions have no effect on the actual
      saved throttle layout files themselves. The only "merging" and "replacing" that occurs is
      simply on your screen.</p>
