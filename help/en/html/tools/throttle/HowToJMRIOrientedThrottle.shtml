      <h1>How to build a throttle oriented JMRI interface</h1>For
      this how to we assume you're an already experienced user of
      JMRI.<br />
      <br />
      Particularly we assume that your JMRI layout connection is
      already working and that you're already able to open a
      Throttle Window and control a locomotive.<br />
      <br />
      Further more we assume that your Roster database already
      exists, all most of these Throttles features are tightly
      linked to the Roster DB and need it to work correctly.<br />

      <h2>1) Prepare your rosters entry</h2>First step is to
      <a href="RostersMediaPane.shtml">fill in the Media and
      Functions labels panes in DecoderPro</a>.<br />
      <br />
      Once this is done and all functions label are defined for
      your rosters, <a href="ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">you
      want to make sure that the options to hide the undefined
      function buttons and the one to use roster image as a
      background for a throttle window</a> are enabled.<br />

      <h2>2) Design your throttle panes</h2>At this step, when you
      open a throttle and select a roster (or enter an address that
      match a roster (there is a <a href=
      "ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">preference setting to enable
      that look back</a>)), the background image should be there,
      and the function butons should reflect what you entered in
      DecoderPro.<br />
      <br />
      Now what you can do, is set up the Throttle Window the way
      you like it, particularly its size, and then for each roster
      set the Function and Control Panel position and size as you
      like ( I personally choose to close the Address Panel, you
      can still reopen it through the View menu, and I don't need
      it most of the time, the save throttle menu entry will also
      save the closed (or iconified) status of inner
      windows).<br />

      <h2>3) Customize with Jynstruments</h2>You can also add some
      specific <a href=
      "../scripting/Jynstruments.shtml">Jynstruments</a> to your
      Throttle Windows, actually you can mix Function Labels in the
      Function Pane for Functions that are not used that often, and
      Jynstruments for the most used one, or some more complex
      functionalities where only a Jython script can do it.<br />
      <br />
      When you're satisfied with step 3) and 4 ) for a specific
      roster, you want to hit the Save menu entry in the <a href=
      "ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">Throttle Window File menu</a> in
      order to save the current Throttle configuration, next time a
      throttle is acquired for that Roster entry, this backup file
      will be automatically loaded and the Throttle Window
      updated.<br />

      <h2>4) Design your throttles layout</h2>Next step is to set
      up the gloabl screen layout, with maybe several Throttle
      Windows, the <a href="ThrottlesListWindow.shtml">Throttle
      List Window</a> (accessible from the <a href=
      "ThrottleToolBar.shtml">Throttle Window toolbar</a>) and
      finally hit the Save throttle layout (or Save as default
      throttle layout) in the <a href=
      "ToolsMenuThrottleEntry.shtml">JMRI Throttles Tools menu
      entry</a>.<br />
      <br />

      <h2>5) Get more control with Jynstruments</h2><a href=
      "AdvancedThrottleControl.shtml">Using Jysntruments it is also
      possible to set up an external controller for a Throttle
      Window.</a> (at the moment USB Joypad or Nintendo Wiimote,
      but more classic Jython scripts exist for USB Raildriver
      device and ...)<br />

      <h2>6) Finally adding a quick start button to the JMRI main
      window</h2>And finally, using the Launchers <a href=
      "../scripting/Jynstruments.shtml">Jynstruments</a> that can
      be dropped at the bottom of the JMRI main Window you can add
      some fast launchers for specific JMRI applications,
      particularly <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/jython/Jynstruments/Launchers/Throttles.jyn/">
      loading the default throttle layout button</a>.<br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: It is not possible to
      save customizations of steps 5) and 6) at the moment.</span>
