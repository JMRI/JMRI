      The Throttle toolbar is accessible from the <a href=
      "ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">Throttles Preferences pane</a>.<br>
      When enabled, a Throttle pane can host a set of Throttles. These Throttles are browsable
      using the:
      <h2>New Button (+)</h2>
      Add a new Throttle in that Throttle Window.<br>
      Once the number of Throttles in a Throttle Window is greater than one (1) the Next, Previous
      and Trash buttons are enabled.
      <h2>Remove Button (-)</h2>
      Remove the current Throttle from that Throttle Window.<br>
      When the number of Throttles in a Throttle Window is equal to one, Next, Previous and Trash
      buttons are disabled.

      <h2>Previous Runing Button</h2>
      Move to previous Throttle with non null speed for that Throttle Window.
      <h2>Previous Button (<)</h2>
      Move to previous Throttle for that Throttle Window.
      <h2>Next Button (>)</h2>
      Move to next Throttle for that Throttle Window.
      <h2>Next Runing Button </h2>
      Move to next Throttle with non null speed for that Throttle Window.

      <h2>Stop all Button (X)</h2>
      Send an emergency stop message to all throttles managed by JMRI.
      <h2>Power Button</h2>
      Allows for layout power control if possible (red icon is Off, green is On, yellow is status
      Unknown).
      <h2>Play Button</h2>
      Allows to switch this throttle window view mode from editing to gaming mode, gaming mode
      remove inner window decorations and makes them semi transparent. Combined with roster entries that have
      nice locomotive image or a Jystrument with video feedback from an embedded camera, and some
      function buttons with nices icons, you can get something really ncie and fun. 
      <h2>List Button</h2>
