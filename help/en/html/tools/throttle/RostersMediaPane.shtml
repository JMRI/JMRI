<h1>Setting roster images and icons</h1>


<img src="images/DecProRosterMediaPane.png" alt=""><br>

<br>

The roster media pane is accessible when using the DecoderPro in
Advanced mode.<br>

<br>

<br>

<h2>Image entry</h2>

Dropping an image file in the inner frame will update this entry (it has
to be an image file, hence after searching on the web for an image you
like, save it on the dektop, and then drop the file in the entry,
dropping image content directly from browser window will not work).<br>

<br>

The Remove button will remove the Image entry in current roster entry.<br>

<br>

Roster images are stored in &lt;JMRI Preferences folder&gt;/resources.
When the image is updated or removed from the roster, the image file is
not removed from its storage in &lt;JMRI Preferences
folder&gt;/resources.<br>

<br>

The Image entry is used as a background for JMRI Throttles <a href="ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">when that option is enabled</a>.<br>

<br>

<h2>Icon entry</h2>

Dropping an image file&nbsp;in the inner frame will update this entry
(it has to be an image file, hence after searching on the web for an
image you like, save it on the dektop, and then drop the file in the
entry, dropping image content directly from browser window will not
work).<br>

<br>

The Remove button will remove the Icon entry in current roster entry.<br>

<br>

Roster icons are stored in &lt;JMRI Preferences folder&gt;/resources.
When the icon is updated or removed from the roster, the image file is
not removed from its storage in &lt;JMRI Preferences
folder&gt;/resources.<br>

<br>

The Icon entry is used in various Roster Combo Boxes in JMRI, and in the
<a href="ThrottlesListWindow.shtml">Throttles List Window</a>.<br>
<br>
It is recommended to use GIF or PNG images with a transparent background
and to have the images turned so that the locomotive head will be to the
right. That will allow for easier transformations of the image in later applications.<br>

<br style="font-style: italic;">

<span style="font-style: italic;">Note: an easy way to find icons
is to search for "train GIF" or look at resources linked to the "<a href="http://www.fsz.bme.hu/traffic/indexe.htm">MM Traffic
Screensaver</a>" in your favorite Internet search engine.</span><br>

<h2>Web reference</h2>

This entry is dedicated towards storing an URL, here I point to the
Wikipedia entry for that roster prototype.<br>

<br>

<h1>Roster function Labels</h1>

<img src="images/DecProFunctionLabels.png" alt=""><br>

<br>

It is also recommended to fill in the Function Labels entries in the
Function Labels pane in DecoderPro (also accessible from Advanced mode). These entries will be reused by the <a href="BasicThrottleWindow.shtml">Function Panel in Throttle Windows</a>.<br>

<br>

There is an option for JMRI Throttles that will show Throttle Function
buttons <a href="ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">only when an entry
is defined here</a>.<br>

<br>

Using the "Export current throttle customization&nbsp;to roster entry"
in <a href="ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">Throttle Windows menu</a> will
update these entries from the Function Panel if required.<br>
<br>
See the Functions Panel documentation in the <a href="BasicThrottleWindow.shtml">Basic Throttle Window description</a>.<br>
<br>
You might also want to have a look at Jynstruments for advanced function buttons.<br>
