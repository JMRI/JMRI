      <h2>Setting Roster Media</h2><img src=
      "images/DecProRosterMediaPane.png" alt="">

      <p>The Roster Media pane is accessible when using DecoderPro
      in Advanced mode.<br>
      <img src="images/DecProAdvancedMode.png" alt=""></p>

      <h3>Image entry</h3>Dropping an image file in the inner frame
      will update this entry (it has to be an image file, hence
      after searching on the web for an image you like, save it on
      the dektop, and then drop the file in the entry, dropping
      image content directly from browser window will not
      work).<br>
      The Remove button will remove the Image entry in current
      roster entry.<br>
      Roster images are stored in &lt;JMRI Preferences
      folder&gt;/resources. When the image is updated or removed
      from the roster, the image file is not removed from its
      storage in &lt;JMRI Preferences folder&gt;/resources.<br>
      The Image entry is used as a background for JMRI Throttles
      <a href="ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">when that option is
      enabled</a>.

      <h3>Icon entry</h3>Dropping an image file in the inner frame
      will update this entry (it has to be an image file, hence
      after searching on the web for an image you like, save it on
      the dektop, and then drop the file in the entry, dropping
      image content directly from browser window will not
      work).<br>
      The Remove button will remove the Icon entry in current
      roster entry.<br>
      Roster icons are stored in &lt;JMRI Preferences
      folder&gt;/resources. When the icon is updated or removed
      from the roster, the image file is not removed from its
      storage in &lt;JMRI Preferences folder&gt;/resources.<br>
      The Icon entry is used in various Roster Combo Boxes in JMRI,
      and in the <a href="ThrottlesListWindow.shtml">Throttles List
      Window</a>.<br>
      It is recommended to use GIF or PNG images with a transparent
      background and to have the images turned so that the
      locomotive head will be to the right. That will allow for
      easier transformations of the image in later
      applications.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: an easy way to find
      icons is to search for "train GIF" or look at resources
      linked to the "<a href=
      "http://www.fsz.bme.hu/traffic/indexe.htm">MM Traffic
      Screensaver</a>" in your favorite Internet search
      engine.</span>

      <h3>Web reference</h3>This entry is dedicated towards storing
      an URL, here I point to the Wikipedia entry for that roster
      prototype.<br>

      <h2>Roster Function Labels</h2><img src=
      "images/DecProFunctionLabels.png" alt="">
      <p>
      It is also recommended to fill in the Function Labels entries
      in the Function Labels pane in DecoderPro (also accessible
      from Advanced mode). These entries will be used by the
      <a href="BasicThrottleWindow.shtml">Function Panel in
      Throttle Windows</a>, and also by the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml">throttle
      apps</a> to display label text instead of the function
      numbers.<br>
      There is an option for JMRI Throttles that will show Throttle
      Function buttons <a href=
      "ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">only when an entry is
      defined here</a>.<br>
      Using the "Export current throttle customization to roster
      entry" in <a href="ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">Throttle
      Windows menu</a> will update these entries from the Function
      Panel if required.<br>
      See the Functions Panel documentation in the <a href=
      "BasicThrottleWindow.shtml">Basic Throttle Window
      description</a>.<br>
      You might also want to have a look at Jynstruments for
      advanced function buttons.</p>
