      <h2>Saving a Throttle Layout</h2>

      <p>A new throttle window can be started and a DCC address
      established to run a train around a layout, and then close
      down the throttle window when done with it. This of course
      loses the configuration that you established during this
      throttle session. And this is fine if you are running a test
      of sorts on a loco that you have no intention of running by
      one of these computer throttles. Therefore, closing down the
      throttle window to eliminate it would suffice.</p>

      <table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing=

          <tr>
            <td align="left" valign="top">
              <p>But what if you don't want to keep establishing a
              new throttle window each time for one or more
              locomotives that you intend on running from your
              computer?</p>

              <p>If you were following along in the <a href=
              "ThrottleChapter2.shtml">previous chapters</a> with
              building up a new throttle layout and got your train
              moving, then the next question that probably comes to
              your mind is, "how do I save it?"</p>

              <p>Following the directions provided in <a href=
              "ThrottleChapter1.shtml#MainMenu">Chapter 1</a> for
              locating the Throttle Menu, locate the option that
              says "<strong>Save Throttle Layout</strong>" (see
              figure 4-1 on the right). Clicking on this menu
              option will display a "<b>Save As</b>" dialog box see
              figure 4-2 below).</p>

      <p>By default, it should show the directory where your roster
      file is located. You can save it to this directory if you
      wish, or you can save it to another location of your
      choosing. For example, the figure on the right shows a
      "Throttles" folder (sub-directory) where all throttle layout
      files are saved.</p>

      <p>After entering a file name of your choosing (and optional
      location) that best supports your railroad environment, the
      current throttle layout will be saved with all preferences,
      including window size and location.</p>

      <p>After the save is successful, you can close down the
      throttle window.</p>

      <p class="important"><b>Note:</b> The "Save" option will save
      <u>all</u> currently opened Throttle windows. They are
      <u>not</u> saved as individual Throttles. This is explained
      in more detail below.</p><a name="SaveMultiple" id=
      "SaveMultiple"></a>

      <h2>Saving Multiple Throttle Windows</h2>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>The above instructions are pretty simple when working
        with a single throttle window.</p>

        <p>But what happens when you have two or more throttle
        windows open at the same time? When you use the save
        option, <u>all</u> opened throttle windows will be saved in
        the same file. When that file is re-opened, all throttle
        windows identified in that file will get opened.</p>

        <p>This is important to understand, especially further
        along when working with <a href="#Merging">merging multiple
        throttles</a>.</p>

                <p>In the previous chapter, a single throttle
                window was initiated. And a simple "save" would
                certainly have saved just the single throttle
                window into a single layout file. When the file is
                opened again, only the single throttle window would

                window was still active on the screen? There would
                then be two active throttle windows that would be
                "saved" into the same layout file (see figure 4-3).
                Not only would the configuration of the throttles
                be saved, but also the exact screen sizing and
                locations of the two throttles.</p>

                <p>When the layout file is re-opened, both throttle
                windows would be opened and positioned on the

      <h2>Open/Load a Throttle Layout</h2>

      <p>After saving a throttle layout has been accomplished,
      you'll want to open the file again. This is a very simple
      procedure. However, opening up a throttle layout file when
      one or more throttle windows are already active somewhere on
      the screen, requires an extra step. Before we discuss this
      extra step, let's first open a simple throttle layout
      file.</p>

      <p>If you were following the guidelines shown above for
      saving a throttle layout file, you should now have created
      your first throttle file. If you haven't done so already,
      close down the throttle window that you created in the
      previous chapter (make sure you saved it first by following
      the above instructions).</p>

      <table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing=
      "0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td align="left" valign="top">
              <p>You shouldn't have any throttle windows open on
              your screen at this time. Following the directions

              locating the Throttle Menu, locate the option that
              says "<strong>Load Throttle Layout</strong>" (see
              figure 4-4 on the right). Clicking on this menu
              option will display an "<b>Open</b>" dialog box.
              Locate the throttle layout file that you just
              previously saved and open it.</p>

      </table>

      <p>The throttle window that you just created should open up
      in the same place where you closed it. At the same time that
      the window opens, it is also initializing the decoder address
      to the command station (just like when the address was first
      "Set"). The throttle attempts to determine the current
      direction of the locomotive, as well as identify any
      functions that are in the "on" state.</p>

      <p class="important"><b>Note:</b> Because the JMRI Throttles
      are still in their "beta" development mode, there are still
      some quirks that need to be ironed out. An example of this is
      when opening a throttle layout and the DCC address is already
      "in use" by another throttle. Some systems (i.e. Digitrax)
      are reacting differently when this occurs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Enhancement requests</b> are already on the list for the
      throttles to be "smart" in determining when another throttle
      already has the address. But until these throttles are fully
      implemented, just beware that there may be quirks with your
      particular DCC system with this feature. It is therefore
      suggested that <u>prior</u> to opening up a saved throttle
      layout file, the DCC address is verified as not being used by
      another throttle somewhere.</p><a name="Merging" id=
      "Merging"></a>

      <h2>Merging Throttle Windows</h2>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>Throttle layout files can consist of a single throttle
        window (to control a single locomotive or consist address),
        or it can contain multiple throttle windows (refer to
        figure 4-3). In either case, when opening a throttle layout
        file, the program will check to see if any existing active
        throttle windows are already open. If none are found, then
        the file is opened just like a simple layout opening
        (explained above).</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: xx-small">
        <img width="354" height="125" src="images/jmri035.jpg"
        title="Merge Dialog Box"><br>
        Figure 4-5: Merge Dialog Box</p>

        <p>However, when one or more throttle windows are
        discovered already open on the screen, the program will
        open up a dialog box as shown in figure 4-5 on the
        right.</p>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Merge</strong> leaves the currently active open
        throttle windows in place and opens the throttle(s)
        contained in the layout file being opened.<br>
        <br></li>

        <li><strong>Replace</strong> closes down the currently
        active open throttle window(s) and opens up the throttle
        window(s) established in the saved layout file.<br>
        <br></li>

        <li><strong>Cancel</strong> cancels the "open" request and
        closes down this dialog window.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="important"><b>Note: Do not confuse the action that
      is occurring here with any attempts to overwrite your saved
      throttle layout files. The above actions have no effect on
      the actual saved throttle layout files themselves. The only
      "merging" and "replacing" that occurs is simply on your
      screen.</b></p>

      <table border="2" width="100%" cellpadding="4" cellspacing=

        <tbody>

            <td valign="top">
              <strong>TIP!</strong>

              <p>When creating throttle layout files, you can save
              the same decoder address in multiple throttle layout
              files. A good example of why you may want to do this
              would be if you create several throttle layout files,
              each consisting of a single throttle window
              controlling one single Locomotive, like one for each
              loco in your Roster. There may be times when you wish
              to just run a single locomotive and you just open up
              the associated layout file. Simple! But what if you
              find yourself opening up the same locomotive
              throttles consistently on each session. It's going to
              become a pain opening up (and "merging") these
              throttles one at a time. Therefore, you could create
              another layout file that contains all of the throttle
              windows that you wish; then just open up the one
              layout file and you'll have all of the throttle
              windows defined.</p>

              <p>Just remember, when making a change to the
              configuration of a throttle window, it only gets
              changed in the layout file that you saved; it is
              <u>not</u> a global change in every file where that
              Locomotive is used.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table><a name="SaveThrottlePreferences" id=
      "SaveThrottlePreferences"></a>

      <h2>Save Throttle Preferences</h2>

      <p>The "Save Throttle Preferences" allows you to customize
      the way new throttles will appear. Load or create one
      throttle that you want as your default. The program will warn
      you if multiple throttles exist. Then use the "Save Throttle
      Preferences" in the "Tools-&gt;Throttle" menu to save the
      throttle. When you create a new throttle, the defaults that
      you set should appear. Also when you use the "Save Throttle
      Preferences" feature the program will create a new directory
      called "throttles" in the JMRI directory. A file called
      "JMRI_ThrottlePreferences.xml" contains the default xml
      values for your throttles. If you want to restore the
      throttle settings to the original defaults, simply delete
      this file.</p>

      <p>To help you better organize your throttles, the program
      will also reference the "throttles" directory when saving or
      loading throttle layouts.</p><a name="CloseThrottle" id=
      "CloseThrottle"></a>

      <h2>Closing a Throttle Window</h2>

      <p>When done with a throttle window, it might be a good idea
      if you get into the practice of either "releasing" or
      "dispatching" the locomotive before completely closing down
      the throttle window.</p>

      <p>If you have made any configuration changes to the throttle
      window, and you want to save them, you'll need to follow the
      steps as outlined above.</p>

      <p class="important"><b>Note:</b> If you "save" any changes
      that you have made during a session back to an existing
      throttle layout file, beware that <u>ALL</u> currently opened
      throttle windows will also be saved to the same file.</p>

      <p>When you are ready, simply close down the throttle window
      as you normally would on whatever computer system you use.
      For example, for Microsoft Windows, simply click on the
      "<big>X</big>" in the upper right corner of the throttle
      window.</p>
