      <h1>Throttles in JMRI v2.x</h1>

      <h2>Where Do I Find the Throttles?</h2>

      <p>Chances are, if you are reading this text, then you probably saw reference to the
      "throttles" in the JMRI user group postings. And the first question that probably came to
      your mind was, "where the heck do I find these throttles?"</p>

      <p>Well you've started at the right place. The first thing this section is going to do is
      show you how to gain access to the throttles. This section will also touch on the menu
      options that are available.</p>

      <p>First, it is important to understand that the JMRI Project is a group of many
      "<strong>tools</strong>" for your railroad - with many contributions from different
      programmers. There are four primary startup applications available</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>DecoderPro</strong> (the most widely and commonly known piece of the
        project)</li>

        <li><strong>JMRI Demo</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Loco Tools</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>PanelPro</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>For the purposes of this user guide, the <strong>JMRI Demo</strong> startup application
      was used for the purposes of writing these pages. However, you will find that many of the
      tools "cross over" to multiple startup applications. The <strong>Throttle Tool</strong> is a
      good example of this. No matter which of the above mentioned applications you start with, you
      will be able to find the throttles.</p>

      <h2 id="MainMenu">The Main (or Primary) Menu</h2>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>In each of the startup applications noted above, there is always a "<em>primary</em>"
        main window displayed on your screen (similar to that shown below in figure 1-1). Close
        down this window and the whole application will terminate. This main window contains a
        primary set of menu options. This is where you will find most of the tools and options
        available - including the Throttles.</p>
      </div>

      <ul style="list-style-type: square">
        <li>Click on "<strong>Tools</strong>".<br></li>

        <li>This will open a submenu.<br></li>

        <li>Navigate your mouse pointer down until you locate
        "<strong>Throttles</strong>".<br></li>

        <li>This will open another submenu.<br></li>

        <li>This is the Throttles Menu (refer to figure 1-2).<br></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="ThrottlesSub">The Throttles Submenu</h2>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>The Throttles submenu (as shown in figure 1-2 below) contains the following menu
        options, which are defined as:</p>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>New Throttle...</strong> opens a single new Throttle window with default
        Throttle settings enabled.<br>
        <br></li>

        <li><strong>Save Throttle Layout...</strong> saves one or more currently opened Throttle
        windows to a user-named file on your hard drive.<br>
        <br></li>

        <li><strong>Load Throttle Layout...</strong> opens a previously saved Throttle file. This
        file can contain one or more Throttle windows depending on how the layout was originally
        saved.<br>
        <br></li>

        <li><strong>Save Throttle Preferences...</strong> allows you to set up your overall
        preferences for all Throttle windows.</li>
      </ul>
