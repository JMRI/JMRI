<h1>Introduction: What Is The Throttle Tool</h1>

<p>The <b>JMRI Throttle Tool</b> is just one of the many digital railroading
tools that are part of the <b>JMRI Project</b>. It has the ability to run a DCC
decoder equipped locomotive around a layout using a computer keyboard and mouse
for control instead of a hand-held throttle. This tool offers many of the same
common features that can be found on most hand-held throttles, including the
ability to control light and sound functions.</p>

<p>This user guide was intended to introduce those unfamiliar with the throttle
tool. After reading through the sections identified below, and trying the
throttle tool on your own, hopefully it will increase your enjoyment of the DCC
model railroading hobby.</p>

<p></p>

<h1>How To Use This Guide</h1>

<p>This user guide was set up almost as a training guide. Each section link in
the left column is organized like a book. If you are new to using the
throttles, follow each section chapter in sequence and the text will walk you
through the process step-by-step — including the opening up of a new throttle
layout, customizing it, and then saving all your hard work.</p>

<p>If you have already found the throttle layout tools, but are looking for
more information about them, then hopefully there is a section or two that can
also be of help. The list of chapters and sections will always be available in
the left column from any page while viewing this guide. There is also a couple
of navigation buttons at the bottom of each page. These will take you to the
next or previous chapters; or the the main table of contents page (see next
paragraph).</p>

<p>In the list of links provided on the left, and located at the conclusion of
each chapter page, there is a link identified as <a href="ThrottleTOC.shtml"
title="Go to the Table Of Contents page"><i><strong>TOC</strong></i></a> or <a
href="ThrottleTOC.shtml"
title="Go to the Table Of Contents page"><i><strong>Table Of
Contents</strong></i></a>. This link will take you to a dedicated table of contents
page. Some may find it easier to navigate using that page instead. However, the
left column does contain all available links that the TOC page contains.</p>

<p class="important"><b style="color: #FF0000">Important Note</b>: Multiple
programmers are involved with the code development on this project. Some work
on the "front end" of the code (which is the interface that you see on your
computer screen), and others are working on the "back end" of the software for
each particular DCC system needs. Although the "front end" should remain
constant across all systems, there may be slight differences experienced on
your particular DCC system and computer in comparison to what is described and
shown in this user guide.<br>
<br>
<b>The examples and references shown in this guide are based on version 1.5.3
of the software, operating under Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional with a
Digitrax system.</b> </p>
