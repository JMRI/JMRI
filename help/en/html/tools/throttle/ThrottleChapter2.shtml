      <h2>Open a New Throttle Window</h2>

      <p>This chapter will walk you through the process of opening up a new throttle window and
      then configuring it to run a locomotive on your layout. For the purposes of this user guide,
      we will be using a locomotive that has been equipped with a sound decoder. The decoder's
      address in our examples here is <strong>8251</strong>. If you are following along with a
      locomotive of your own while you read this, simply replace your loco's decoder address
      anywhere that "8251" is shown.</p>

      <p>So let's get started.</p>

            the <a href="ThrottleChapter1.shtml" title="Go back to review Chapter 1">previous
            chapter</a>, this is accomplished by selecting the following menu options from the

      <h3 id="StructWin">Structure of a Throttle Window</h3>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>There are <em>three panels</em> (or sub-windows) associated with each Throttle window.
        These are identified as:</p>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Control Panel</strong> contains a throttle slider to control the speed of the
        loco, a forward and reverse selector, an Emergency Stop action button, and an Idle action
        button (mostly used for sound equipped decoders).<br>
        <br></li>

        <li><strong>Function Panel</strong> is used to associate the function buttons with the
        active output functions of the decoder.<br>
        <br></li>

        <li><strong>Address Panel</strong> is used to identify the decoder's address, and to
        dispatch or release the identified address.<br>
        <br></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="important"><strong>Important!</strong> These three panels are actually windows
      defined within an overall window. Please note that each of these panels contain their own
      "minimize" and "close" buttons - as well as can also be resized. You can actually minimize
      one or more of these panels within the Throttle window. This is being pointed out in event
      that you accidentally click on one of the buttons and the panel disappears on you.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: xx-small"><img width="323" height="464" src=

      <h2 id="WinConfig">Configure The New Throttle</h2>

      <p>Now that we have successfully opened up the throttle window, the next thing we need to do
      is to configure the throttle for operation. We'll do this in two steps. The first will be to
      assign a locomotive's decoder address. Please note in Figure 2-2 above that all of the panels
      are pretty much disabled. This is because there is no address assigned yet. After
      establishing an address, the other options on the panels will become enabled.</p>

      <h3 id="AddressPanel">Assign a Decoder Address to a Throttle</h3>

            <tr>

                <p>The first thing that needs to happen before any options or buttons in the window
                become active, is to assign a decoder's address in the "<strong>Address
                Panel</strong>". There are two ways that this can be accomplished.</p>

                <ol>
                  <li>Manually enter the decoder's address in the large text box, then click on the
                  "<strong>Set</strong>" button.<br>

                      <p class="important"><strong>Important!</strong> When manually entering an
                      address, be sure to click on the <strong>Set</strong> button. Without this

                  figure on the right).<br>
                  Please note that when you select a loco from this list, it simply reads the
                  decoders address from the roster file - it currently does <u>not</u> cross
                  reference this to any saved throttle layout files.</li>

          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <p>Now that you have established an address for the throttle, you should be able to
                run the train on your layout (if your layout is active and the address you entered
                is valid to a locomotive on the track). You do this using the "<strong>Control
                Panel</strong>" (see Figure 2-5). But here is where things get a little sticky.</p>

                <p>There are multiple combinations of DCC systems and computer platforms that make
                up for slight differences in the functionality of the throttles. The programmers
                are working hard at trying to get these throttles to function identically. But
                because of these differences, you may discover that not everything noted in the
                following text will function as defined for your system.</p>

                <p class="important"><strong>Important!</strong> The "Control Panel" must have the
                "focus" for it to become active (and usable). In other words, it's window bar must
                be active. If you are following along with this text with your own locomotive and
                just entered an address in the Address Panel, you will discover that the Address
                Panel is the window with the current focus. None of the keyboard or mouse actions
                described below will move the train until the Control Panel has the focus. To make
                the Control Panel the active window, use your mouse pointer to click somewhere
                within the Control Panel.</p>

                click with your mouse pointer in the Control Panel.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>If you click anywhere near the slider, your loco may take off on you
                  unexpectedly (more on this below).</strong>
                  </li>

                  <li><strong>If you click anywhere on the words "Forward" or "Reverse", you will
                  activate that action - which isn't too bad - except if the loco is running in the
                  opposite direction from what action you clicked on.</strong>
                  </li>

                  <li><strong>Depending on your screen resolution size, if you attempt to click on
                  the window bar itself, you may accidentally close down the Control Panel window
                  or minimize it. This could of course immediately confuse any new user.</strong>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>So when first clicking in the Control Panel to make it the "active" window with
                the focus, and you know that your loco is stopped, it is suggested to click on the
                "Idle" button (if you know for fact that your loco is stopped), or the forward or
                reverse area (depending of course on the current direction of the loco). In other
                words, you want to click somewhere within the border of the Control Panel window,
                yet not cause your loco to do something that you don't want it to do.</p>

                <p>After a little experimentation, you will discover what is comfortable for your
                usage. The only point we are trying to make here is that many new users immediately
                get frustrated with the throttles because they can't get their loco to move, not
                realizing that the Control Panel does not have the focus. Or they have clicked on a
                function button (more on these below), which then changes the "active" window to
                the Function Panel.</p>

          <p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> The implied keys noted above (with the
          exception of the arrow keys) are those found on the numeric keypad of the keyboard. For
          laptops and other keyboards that don't have a separate numeric keypad, experimentation on
          your part may be needed to find the correct key combination. The arrow keys are usually
          found grouped in their own separate area.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Using the standard key actions are pretty easy. After making the Control Panel have the
        active focus, each click of the <strong>+</strong> on the numeric keypad should increase
        the speed on your locomotive. Each click of the <strong>-</strong> key on the numeric
        keypad should decrease the speed of your locomotive. To bring the locomotive to a stop, a
        single click of the <strong>/</strong> key on the numeric keypad will set the speed of the
        locomotive to zero.</p>

        <p>Of course, in addition to the standard keyboard actions, what is the point of having a
        mouse if you can't use the mouse to control your trains. So now let's discuss how to move

      <h4 id="SliderBar">THE SLIDER BAR</h4>

      <div style="margin-left: 6em">
        <p>The slider bar can function differently for each user depending on several factors. This
        user guide is not going to try to identify all of the different possibilities. Instead, it
        is going to identify several of the primary ways that the slider bar can work. At least one
        of these methods should work for you. You may discover that your setup can utilize more
        than one of these. A little experimentation on your part may be required.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Slider Method 1</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Clicking anywhere above the current slider pointer position will INCREASE the
              loco speed by 1 speed step. For example, if the locomotive's current speed setting
              was 23, then a single click will advance the speed to 24. Another click will increase
              the speed to 25. Another click...to speed step 26. Another...to speed step 27. And so
              on...until it reaches the maximum speed steps for your system. This action has the
              same effect as using the <strong>+</strong> key on the numeric keypad.<br>
              <br></li>

              <li>Clicking anywhere below the current slider pointer position will DECREASE the
              loco speed by 1 speed step. For example, if the locomotive's current speed setting is
              21, then a single click will decrease the speed to 20. Another click will decrease
              the speed to 20. Another click...to speed step 19. And so on...until it reaches speed
              step 0. This action has the same effect as using the <strong>-</strong> key on the
              numeric keypad.<br>
              <br></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> Clicking too far below the slider
            (especially when close to the bottom of the slider bar) may not have any effect because
            you are actually clicking on the "Forward" option. Therefore, it is suggested that when
            decreasing speed with this method, that you click on the word "Stop" (not the emergency
            stop button (STOP!) but the word "Stop" located at the lower end of the speed
            slider).</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> If the decoder has acceleration or braking
            rates enabled, the loco will speed up or slow down accordingly. If no momentum values
            are enabled, the loco will speed up or slow down abruptly.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Slider Method 2</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Click and hold the left mouse button over the slider pointer and then drag it to
              a speed that you wish, and release the mouse button. This will send a "set speed to"
              command to the decoder.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> If the decoder has acceleration or braking
            rates enabled, the loco will speed up or slow down accordingly. If no momentum values
            are enabled, the loco will speed up or slow down abruptly to the speed set when the
            mouse button was released.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Slider Method 3</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Clicking anywhere above the current slider pointer position will increase the
              slider pointer to the place where the mouse pointer was clicked. For example, if the
              locomotive's current speed setting was around 25% of the slider bar, and the mouse
              pointer was positioned near approximately the 75% point the slider bar when clicked,
              then the speed of the locomotive would be changed to approximately 75%.</li>

              <li>Clicking anywhere below the current slider pointer position will decrease the
              slider pointer to the place where the mouse pointer was clicked. For example, if the
              locomotive's current speed setting was around 50% of the slider bar, and the mouse
              pointer was positioned approximately around the 25% point on the slider bar when
              clicked, then the speed of the locomotive would be changed to approximately 25%.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> If the decoder has acceleration or braking
            rates enabled, the loco will speed up or slow down accordingly. If no momentum values
            are enabled, the loco will speed up or slow down abruptly.</p>

                <p>The easiest way to stop a locomotive for any of the methods outlined above is to

                Control Panel window.</p>

                <p>Or more abruptly, you can also click on the emergency stop button:

        <p>If you have discovered that your system works in some way different from any of those

      </div>

      <h3 id="Acquiring">Acquiring a Dispatched Locomotive</h3>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>When the decoder address is first "<strong>Set</strong>", the software queries the
        current status of the decoder. This includes the current direction of the locomotive, its
        current speed, and what function buttons are on or off. The software will set the current
        direction indicator and identify any functions that are "active" (in the "on" state). But,
        if the loco is moving, the loco's speed is not established on the Speed Control slider
        bar.</p>

        <p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> At this time, the slider bar does <u>not</u>
        automatically correspond to the actual speed. This is important to understand because of
        what action you are going to see when you first click on the speed slider bar. When you
        first "<strong>Set</strong>" a decoder address, the slider bar is set to the zero (0)
        position. So if you acquired a locomotive that is actually moving and you click on the
        slider bar, it is going to set the speed to zero (or wherever you click and set the slider
        bar pointer).<br>
        <br>
        A future enhancement of the throttle feature will be to synchronize the slider bar pointer
        accordingly. Until then, just beware of this little reaction.</p>

                <p>The Function Panel has 28 function buttons available for each throttle window.
                Most decoders currently don't handle 28 functions. The function panel displays the
                buttons in two groups, press the "*" button in the lower left corner to see the
                second set of function buttons.</p>

                <p>Clicking on the function buttons correlate to pressing the same function button
                on a hand-held throttle. The F0 function is normally used for the lights.</p>

                <p>This is the basic functionality of the Function Panel. All buttons function like
                an on/off toggle: click once to turn "on"; click again to turn "off".</p>
