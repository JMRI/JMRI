      <h2>Open a New Throttle Window</h2>

      <p>This chapter will walk you through the process of opening
      up a new throttle window and then configuring it to run a
      locomotive on your layout. For the purposes of this user
      guide, we will be using a locomotive that has been equipped
      with a sound decoder. The decoder's address in our examples
      here is <b>8251</b>. If you are following along with a
      locomotive of your own while you read this, simply replace
      your loco's decoder address anywhere that "8251" is
      shown.</p>

      <p>So let's get started.</p>

      <table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing=
      "0">

              <p>The first thing that we want to do is to open up a
              throttle window. As outlined in the <a href=

              "Go back to review Chapter 1">previous chapter</a>,
              this is accomplished by selecting the following menu
              options from the primary main window:</p>

      <h3>Structure of a Throttle Window</h3>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>There are <i>three panels</i> (or sub-windows)
        associated with each Throttle window. These are identified
        as:</p>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Control Panel</b> contains a throttle slider to
        control the speed of the loco, a forward and reverse
        selector, an Emergency Stop action button, and an Idle
        action button (mostly used for sound equipped
        decoders).<br>
        <br></li>

        <li><b>Function Panel</b> is used to associate the function
        buttons with the active output functions of the
        decoder.<br>
        <br></li>

        <li><b>Address Panel</b> is used to identify the decoder's
        address, and to dispatch or release the identified
        address.<br>
        <br></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="important"><b>Important!</b> These three panels are
      actually windows defined within an overall window. Please
      note that each of these panels contain their own "minimize"
      and "close" buttons - as well as can also be resized. You can
      actually minimize one or more of these panels within the
      Throttle window. This is being pointed out in event that you
      accidentally click on one of the buttons and the panel
      disappears on you.</p>

      <h2>Configure The New Throttle</h2>

      <p>Now that we have successfully opened up the throttle
      window, the next thing we need to do is to configure the
      throttle for operation. We'll do this in two steps. The first
      will be to assign a locomotive's decoder address. Please note
      in Figure 2-2 above that all of the panels are pretty much
      disabled. This is because there is no address assigned yet.
      After establishing an address, the other options on the
      panels will become enabled.</p><a name="AddressPanel"></a>

      <h3>Assign a Decoder Address to a Throttle</h3>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing=
        "0">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td valign="top">
                <p>The first thing that needs to happen before any
                options or buttons in the window become active, is
                to assign a decoder's address in the "<b>Address
                Panel</b>". There are two ways that this can be
                accomplished.</p>

                <ol>
                  <li>Manually enter the decoder's address in the
                  large text box, then click on the
                  "<big>Set</big>" button.<br>

                    <div style="margin-left: 2em">
                      <p class="important"><b>Important!</b> When
                      manually entering an address, be sure to
                      click on the <big>Set</big> button. Without
                      this step, all throttle actions remain
                      disabled.</p>
                    </div>
                  </li>

                  <li>Or, use the drop down list to select from the
                  roster list (as shown in the figure on the
                  right).<br>
                  Please note that when you select a loco from this
                  list, it simply reads the decoders address from
                  the roster file - it currently does <u>not</u>
                  cross reference this to any saved throttle layout
                  files.</li>

                  in dispatch state at the command station - all
                  others are either "in use" or "idle" (released).
                  The controls and options in the throttle window

            <tr>
              <td valign="top" align="left">
                <p>Now that you have established an address for the
                throttle, you should be able to run the train on
                your layout (if your layout is active and the
                address you entered is valid to a locomotive on the
                track). You do this using the "<b>Control
                Panel</b>" (see Figure 2-5). But here is where
                things get a little sticky.</p>

                <p>There are multiple combinations of DCC systems
                and computer platforms that make up for slight
                differences in the functionality of the throttles.
                The programmers are working hard at trying to get
                these throttles to function identically. But
                because of these differences, you may discover
                that not everything noted in the following text
                will function as defined for your system.</p>

                <p class="important"><b>Important!</b> The "Control
                Panel" must have the "focus" for it to become
                active (and usable). In other words, it's window
                bar must be active. If you are following along with
                this text with your own locomotive and just entered
                an address in the Address Panel, you will discover
                that the Address Panel is the window with the
                current focus. None of the keyboard or mouse
                actions described below will move the train until
                the Control Panel has the focus. To make the
                Control Panel the active window, use your mouse
                pointer to click somewhere within the Control
                Panel.</p>

                Beware of where you click with your mouse pointer
                in the Control Panel.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>If you click anywhere near the slider,
                  your loco may take off on you unexpectedly (more
                  on this below).</b></li>

                  <li><b>If you click anywhere on the words
                  "Forward" or "Reverse", you will activate that
                  action - which isn't too bad - except if the loco
                  is running in the opposite direction from what
                  action you clicked on.</b></li>

                  <li><b>Depending on your screen resolution size,
                  if you attempt to click on the window bar itself,
                  you may accidentally close down the Control Panel
                  window or minimize it. This could of course
                  immediately confuse any new user.</b></li>
                </ul>

                <p>So when first clicking in the Control Panel to
                make it the "active" window with the focus, and you
                know that your loco is stopped, it is suggested to
                click on the "Idle" button (if you know for fact
                that your loco is stopped), or the forward or
                reverse area (depending of course on the current
                direction of the loco). In other words, you want to
                click somewhere within the border of the Control
                Panel window, yet not cause your loco to do
                something that you don't want it to do.</p>

                <p>After a little experimentation, you will
                discover what is comfortable for your usage. The
                only point we are trying to make here is that many
                new users immediately get frustrated with the
                throttles because they can't get their loco to
                move, not realizing that the Control Panel does not
                have the focus. Or they have clicked on a function
                button (more on these below), which then changes
                the "active" window to the Function Panel.</p>

      <h4>THE SLIDER BAR</h4>

      <div style="margin-left: 6em">
        <p>The slider bar can function differently for each user
        depending on several factors. This user guide is not going
        to try to identify all of the different possibilities.
        Instead, it is going to identify several of the primary
        ways that the slider bar can work. At least one of these
        methods should work for you. You may discover that your
        setup can utilize more than one of these. A little
        experimentation on your part may be required.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Slider Method 1</strong>

            <ul>
              <li>Clicking anywhere above the current slider
              pointer position will INCREASE the loco speed by 1
              speed step. For example, if the locomotive's current
              speed setting was 23, then a single click will
              advance the speed to 24. Another click will increase
              the speed to 25. Another click...to speed step 26.
              Another...to speed step 27. And so on...until it
              reaches the maximum speed steps for your system. This
              action has the same effect as using the <big>+</big>
              key on the numeric keypad.<br>
              <br></li>

              <li>Clicking anywhere below the current slider
              pointer position will DECREASE the loco speed by 1
              speed step. For example, if the locomotive's current
              speed setting is 21, then a single click will
              decrease the speed to 20. Another click will decrease
              the speed to 20. Another click...to speed step 19.
              And so on...until it reaches speed step 0. This
              action has the same effect as using the <big>-</big>
              key on the numeric keypad.<br>
              <br></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="important"><b>Note:</b> Clicking too far
            below the slider (especially when close to the bottom
            of the slider bar) may not have any effect because you
            are actually clicking on the "Forward" option.
            Therefore, it is suggested that when decreasing speed
            with this method, that you click on the word "Stop"
            (not the emergency stop button (STOP!) but the word
            "Stop" located at the lower end of the speed
            slider).</p><br>

            <p class="important"><b>Note:</b> If the decoder has

            <ul>
              <li>Click and hold the left mouse button over the
              slider pointer and then drag it to a speed that you
              wish, and release the mouse button. This will send a
              "set speed to" command to the decoder.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="important"><b>Note:</b> If the decoder has
            acceleration or braking rates enabled, the loco will

              pointer position will increase the slider pointer to
              the place where the mouse pointer was clicked. For
              example, if the locomotive's current speed setting
              was around 25% of the slider bar, and the mouse
              pointer was positioned near approximately the 75%
              point the slider bar when clicked, then the speed of
              the locomotive would be changed to approximately
              75%.</li>

              <li>Clicking anywhere below the current slider
              pointer position will decrease the slider pointer to
              the place where the mouse pointer was clicked. For
              example, if the locomotive's current speed setting
              was around 50% of the slider bar, and the mouse
              pointer was positioned approximately around the 25%
              point on the slider bar when clicked, then the speed
              of the locomotive would be changed to approximately
              25%.</li>

      </div><a name="Acquiring"></a>

      <h3>Acquiring a Dispatched Locomotive</h3>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>When the decoder address is first "<big>Set</big>", the
        software queries the current status of the decoder. This
        includes the current direction of the locomotive, its
        current speed, and what function buttons are on or off. The
        software will set the current direction indicator and
        identify any functions that are "active" (in the "on"
        state). But, if the loco is moving, the loco's speed is not
        established on the Speed Control slider bar.</p>

        <p class="important"><b>Note:</b> At this time, the slider
        bar does <u>not</u> automatically correspond to the actual
        speed. This is important to understand because of what
        action you are going to see when you first click on the
        speed slider bar. When you first "<big>Set</big>" a decoder
        address, the slider bar is set to the zero (0) position. So
        if you acquired a locomotive that is actually moving and
        you click on the slider bar, it is going to set the speed
        to zero (or wherever you click and set the slider bar
        pointer).<br>
        <br>
        A future enhancement of the throttle feature will be to
        synchronize the slider bar pointer accordingly. Until then,
        just beware of this little reaction.</p>
