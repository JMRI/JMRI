      <h2>Advanced Configuration of the Function Panel</h2>

      <table style="width: 100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>When a new throttle window is initialized, all function button labels are set up
              with a set of defaults (F1...F2...F3...etc.). These are closely related to hand-held
              throttles. But one of the cool features that the JMRI Throttles have to offer over
              hand-held throttles, is the ability to customize the button labels. In addition, each
              button can be hidden from view or switched to an "unlocked" button.</p>

              <p>The example image on the right shows the default Function Panel window. When the
              mouse pointer hovers over the top of the button, a <strong>right click</strong> of
              the mouse will display a menu with the only option on this menu at this time being
              "<strong>Properties</strong>".</p>

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>

              <p>When the "<strong>Properties</strong>" option is clicked on, the "<strong>Edit
              Function Button</strong>" window opens (see the example image on the left).</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Function Number</strong> associates the button with a function
                number</li>

                <li><strong>Text</strong> customizable button label text</li>

                <li><strong>Font Size</strong> set the size of text displayed on button</li>

                <li><strong>Lockable</strong> identifies whether the button acts as an "on/off"
                toggle switch; or as a momentary switch</li>

                <li><strong>Visible</strong> identifies whether the button is visible in the
                Function Panel window</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>By default, the <strong>Function Number</strong> is associated with the button number that
      you initially right-clicked on. For example, in the figures shown above, function number "1"
      (F1) is being edited. It is recommended that you leave this number as is, however, you
      <u>can</u> change this to a different function number if you really wish. An example of why
      you might want to do this is if you really want the "lights" button, which is usually F0
      (located as the last/bottom button by default), to be located as the first button in the
      Function Panel.</p>

      <p class="important"><strong>Warning! If any modifications are done to the "Function Number"
      field, verify to make sure that no two buttons are assigned the same function number as some
      unwanted consequences may occur.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>The <strong>Text</strong> field will be the most welcome and modified field. By default,
      it is set similar to hand-held throttles: F1...F2...F3...etc. The content of the field is
      pretty much open to the imagination, however, there is going to be a point where the length
      of the text is <u>not</u> going to fit on the button. The <strong>Font Size</strong> field is
      available to also assist in getting the wanted text to fit on the button. A little
      experimentation will be required here to determine what looks good for you and what will
      fit.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Lockable</strong> check box may be a little confusing at first. When enabled,
      as it is by default, it simply means that when the button is clicked on, it will "lock"
      itself in either an "on" state or an "off" state. In other words, the button will act as a
      toggle switch: click once to turn the function "on"; click again to turn the function "off".
      The opposite of this action is what happens when the check box is <strong>disabled</strong>.
      Then the button acts like a momentary switch: supplying a momentary "on" command for as long
      as the mouse button is clicked <em>and held</em> over the button. When the mouse button is
      released, an "off" command is sent to the function. A good example of where one might want to
      use this is when customizing a throttle setup for a sound decoder. The horn/whistle is closer
      to functional when this option is disabled. Depending on the speed of the computer system and
      the DCC system, short and quick click and releases would provide a short blast of the horn or
      whistle. Holding down the button a little longer would produce a longer held blast of the
      whistle.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Visible</strong> check box allows for the "removal" of unwanted buttons. By
      default, all function buttons are enabled as "visible" so that they can obviously be seen.
      But if there is only a single function being used, for example the "lights" (F0), then this
      option does provide the ability to "hide" all of the other buttons.</p>

      <p class="important"><strong>Warning! Disabling the "Visible" check box should be one of the
      last steps performed during this customization process. The reason for this is that once the
      button is marked as "invisible" (by removing the check box), it is indeed invisible to the
      user and therefore can't be right-clicked on with the mouse in order to get the "Edit
      Function Button" window back. To make all buttons visible select "View-&gt;Show All Function
      Buttons."</strong>

      <p>There are a few optional options that affect the general preferences of the overall JMRI
      Throttle window. These are found in a couple of menu options located just under the main
      title bar of the window.</p>

                the 3 sub-windows (Address Panel, Function Panel, & Control Panel) that make up the

              <td colspan="3">
                <p>As noted in <a href="ThrottleChapter1.shtml">Chapter 1</a>, because each
                sub-window has a minimize and close buttons, if one gets closed down in error, this
                menu option allows you to restore the window again.</p>

                <p>Another way to use this option is when using the features of the throttles for
                decoders that are <u>not</u> associated with a motor (such as a lighted passenger
                car or caboose or a Fred unit). In these cases, critical screen real estate can be
                saved by being able to disable (or close down) the Control Panel. Be a little
                creative with the window resizing, and you could have several of these custom
                throttle windows in the same area as one single complete throttle window would take
                up.</p>
