          <tr>
            <td align="left" valign="top">
              <p>When a new throttle window is initialized, all
              function button labels are set up with a set of
              defaults (F1...F2...F3...etc.). These are closely
              related to hand-held throttles. But one of the cool
              features that the JMRI Throttles have to offer over
              hand-held throttles, is the ability to customize the
              button labels. In addition, each button can be hidden
              from view or switched to an "unlocked" button.</p>

              <p>The example image on the right shows the default
              Function Panel window. When the mouse pointer hovers
              over the top of the button, a <strong>right
              click</strong> of the mouse will display a menu with
              the only option on this menu at this time being
              "<b>Properties</b>".</p>

            <td align="left" valign="top">
              <p>When the "<b>Properties</b>" option is clicked on,
              the "<b>Edit Function Button</b>" window opens (see
              the example image on the left).</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Function Number</strong> associates the
                button with a function number</li>

                <li><strong>Text</strong> customizable button label
                text</li>

                <li><strong>Font Size</strong> set the size of text
                displayed on button</li>

                <li><strong>Lockable</strong> identifies whether
                the button acts as an "on/off" toggle switch; or as
                a momentary switch</li>

                <li><strong>Visible</strong> identifies whether the
                button is visible in the Function Panel window</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>By default, the <strong>Function Number</strong> is
      associated with the button number that you initially
      right-clicked on. For example, in the figures shown above,
      function number "1" (F1) is being edited. It is recommended
      that you leave this number as is, however, you <u>can</u>
      change this to a different function number if you really
      wish. An example of why you might want to do this is if you
      really want the "lights" button, which is usually F0 (located
      as the last/bottom button by default), to be located as the
      first button in the Function Panel.</p>

      <p class="important"><b>Warning! If any modifications are
      done to the "Function Number" field, verify to make sure that
      no two buttons are assigned the same function number as some
      unwanted consequences may occur.</b></p>

      <p>The <strong>Text</strong> field will be the most welcome
      and modified field. By default, it is set similar to
      hand-held throttles: F1...F2...F3...etc. The content of the
      field is pretty much open to the imagination, however, there
      is going to be a point where the length of the text is
      <u>not</u> going to fit on the button. The <strong>Font
      Size</strong> field is available to also assist in getting
      the wanted text to fit on the button. A little
      experimentation will be required here to determine what looks
      good for you and what will fit.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Lockable</strong> check box may be a little
      confusing at first. When enabled, as it is by default, it
      simply means that when the button is clicked on, it will
      "lock" itself in either an "on" state or an "off" state. In
      other words, the button will act as a toggle switch: click
      once to turn the function "on"; click again to turn the
      function "off". The opposite of this action is what happens
      when the check box is <b>disabled</b>. Then the button acts
      like a momentary switch: supplying a momentary "on" command
      for as long as the mouse button is clicked <i>and held</i>
      over the button. When the mouse button is released, an "off"
      command is sent to the function. A good example of where one
      might want to use this is when customizing a throttle setup
      for a sound decoder. The horn/whistle is closer to functional
      when this option is disabled. Depending on the speed of the
      computer system and the DCC system, short and quick click and
      releases would provide a short blast of the horn or whistle.
      Holding down the button a little longer would produce a
      longer held blast of the whistle.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Visible</strong> check box allows for the
      "removal" of unwanted buttons. By default, all function
      buttons are enabled as "visible" so that they can obviously
      be seen. But if there is only a single function being used,
      for example the "lights" (F0), then this option does provide
      the ability to "hide" all of the other buttons.</p>

      <p class="important"><b>Warning! Disabling the "Visible"
      check box should be one of the last steps performed during
      this customization process. The reason for this is that once
      the button is marked as "invisible" (by removing the check
      box), it is indeed invisible to the user and therefore can't
      be right-clicked on with the mouse in order to get the "Edit
      Function Button" window back. To make all buttons visible
      select "View-&gt;Show All Function Buttons."</b></p>

                <p>As noted in <a href=
                "ThrottleChapter1.shtml">Chapter 1</a>, because
                each sub-window has a minimize and close buttons,
                if one gets closed down in error, this menu option
                allows you to restore the window again.</p>

                <p>Another way to use this option is when using the
                features of the throttles for decoders that are
                <u>not</u> associated with a motor (such as a
                lighted passenger car or caboose or a Fred unit).
                In these cases, critical screen real estate can be
                saved by being able to disable (or close down) the
                Control Panel. Be a little creative with the window
                resizing, and you could have several of these
                custom throttle windows in the same area as one
                single complete throttle window would take up.</p>
