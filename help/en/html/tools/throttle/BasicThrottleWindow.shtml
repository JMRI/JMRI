      <h1>Using the Throttle Pane</h1><img src=
      "images/BasicThrottleWindow.png" alt=
      "BasicThrottleWindow.png"><br>

      <h2>Basic structure of a Throttle Window</h2>There are three
      panels (or sub-windows) associated with each Throttle window.
      These are identified as:<br>

      <ul>
        <li>Control Panel - contains a throttle slider to control
        the speed of the loco, a forward and reverse selector, an
        Emergency Stop action button, and an Idle action button
        (mostly used for sound equipped decoders).</li>

        <li>Function Panel - is used to associate the function
        buttons with the active output functions of the
        decoder.</li>

        <li>Address Panel - is used to identify the decoder's
        address, and to dispatch or release the identified
        address.</li>
      </ul>Note that these three panels are actually windows
      defined within an overall window, each of these panels
      contain their own "minimize" and "close" buttons - as well as
      can also be resized. You can actually minimize one or more of
      these panels within the Throttle window. When one of these
      subwindows is closed, is can be reopened through <a href=
      "ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">the View menu</a>.<br>
      <br>
      For details about usage of the <a href=
      "ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">Throttle window menus, see
      there</a>.<br>

      of a Throttle, see there</a>.<br>
      <br>

      <h2>Address Panel - Assign a Decoder Address to a
      Throttle</h2>The first thing that needs to happen before any
      options or buttons in the window become active, is to assign
      a decoder's address in the "Address Panel". There are two
      ways that this can be accomplished.<br>
      <br>
      Manually enter the decoder's address in the large text box or
      select an existing Roster entry though the drop down menu,
      then click on the "Set" button.<br>
      When manually entering an address, be sure to click on the
      Set button. Without this step, all throttle actions remain
      disabled.<br>
      <br>
      Note that there is an option in the <a href=
      "ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">Throttles Preferences
      Pane</a> that will enable an automatic look back in the
      roster DB when an address is entered, and eventually trigger
      an automatic set up of the full throttle if any matching
      Roster entry is found.<br>
      <br>
      After an address is selected, all other controls and options
      in the throttle window will be enabled:<br>

      <ul>
        <li>Dispatch - releases the decoder address back to the
        command station in a "dispatch" mode. Usually, only one
        address can be in dispatch state at the command station -
        all others are either "in use" or "idle" (released). The
        controls and options in the throttle window will become
        disabled until another address is "Set".</li>

        <li>Release - releases the decoder address back to the
        command station as "no longer needed". The controls and
        options in the throttle window will become disabled until
        another address is "Set".</li>

        <li>Program - opens an ops-mode (programming on the main)
        DecoderPro programmer for the selected locomotive. It's
        only active when a roster entry has been selected on the
        throttle.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Control Panel - Let's Run a Train</h2>Now that you have
      established an address for the throttle, you should be able
      to run the train on your layout (if your layout is active and
      the address you entered is valid to a locomotive on the
      track). You do this using the "Control Panel".<br>

      <ul>
        <li>The slider will control the throttle speed.</li>

        <li>The Forward and Reverse button its direction.</li>

        <li>The STOP! button will send a emergency stop (DCC speed
        to -1) message to the locomotive.</li>

        <li>The Idle one will stop the locomotive smoothly (DCC
        speed to 0) (if the decoder has acceleration or braking
        rates enabled, the loco will speed up or slow down
        accordingly. If no momentum values are enabled, the loco
        will speed up or slow down abruptly.).</li>
      </ul>Beware of where you click with your mouse pointer in the
      Control Panel. If you click anywhere near the slider, your
      loco may take off on you unexpectedly (more on this below).
      If you click anywhere on the words "Forward" or "Reverse",
      you might change current train direction.<br>
      <br>

      <h3>Control Panel config pane</h3><img src=
      "images/ControlPanelPreferences.png" alt=
      "ControlPanelPreferences.png"><br>
      This pane if accessible by right clicking in the Control
      Panel pane and opening Properties menu entry<br>
      <br>

      <h2>The Function Panel</h2>The Function Panel has 28 function
      buttons available for each throttle. Most decoders currently
      don't handle 28 functions. The function panel displays the
      buttons in two groups, press the "*" button in the lower left
      corner to see the second set of function buttons.<br>
      <br>
      Clicking on the function buttons correlate to pressing the
      same function button on a hand-held throttle. The F0 function
      is normally used for the lights.<br>
      <br>
      This is the basic functionality of the Function Panel. All
      buttons function like an on/off toggle - click once to turn
      "on"; click again to turn "off".<br>
      <br>

      <h3>Function Button config pane</h3><img src=
      "images/FunctionButtonProperties.png" alt=
      "FunctionButtonProperties.png"><br>
      This pane if accessible by right clicking in the AddressPanel
      pane, on a specific Function Button and opening Properties
      menu entry.<br>
      <br>
      Note that for Throttles that have an associated Roster, it is
      better to define these settings in the <a href=
      "RostersMediaPane.shtml">Function label pane</a> in
      DecoderPro (however if you change them here, you can still
      export these changes to the Roster through the <a href=
      "ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">Export to Roster</a> menu
      entry).<br>

      <ul>
        <li>Function Number - associates the button with a function
        number</li>

        <li>Text - customizable button label text</li>

        <li>Font Size - size of text displayed on button</li>

        <li>Lockable - identifies whether the button acts as an
        "on/off" toggle switch; or as a momentary switch</li>

        <li>Visible - identifies whether the button is visible in
        the Function Panel window</li>
      </ul>By default, the Function Number is associated with the
      button number that you initially right-clicked on. For
      example, in the figures shown above, function number "3" (F3)
      is being edited. It is recommended that you leave this number
      as is, however, you can change this to a different function
      number if you really wish. An example of why you might want
      to do this is if you really want the "lights" button - which
      is usually F0 (located as the last/bottom button by default)
      - to be located as the first button in the Function
      Panel.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning!</span> If any
      modifications are done to the "Function Number" field, verify
      to make sure that no two buttons are assigned the same
      function number - some unwanted consequences may occur.<br>
      <br>
      The Text field will be the most welcome and modified field.
      By default, it is set similar to hand-held throttles:
      F1...F2...F3...etc. The content of the field is pretty much
      open to the imagination, however, there is going to be a
      point where the length of the text is not going to fit on the
      button. The Font Size field is available to also assist in
      getting the wanted text to fit on the button. A little
      experimentation will be required here to determine what looks
      good for you - and what will fit.<br>
      The Lockable check box may be a little confusing at first.
      When enabled - as it is by default - it simply means that
      when the button is clicked on, it will "lock" itself in
      either an "on" state or an "off" state. In other words, the
      button will act as a toggle switch - click once to turn the
      function "on"; click again to turn the function "off". The
      opposite of this action is what happens when the check box is
      disabled. Then the button acts like a momentary switch -
      supplying a momentary "on" command for as long as the mouse
      button is clicked and held over the button. When the mouse
      button is released, an "off" command is sent to the function.
      A good example of where one might want to use this is when
      customizing a throttle setup for a sound decoder. The
      horn/whistle is closer to functional when this option is
      disabled. Depending on the speed of the computer system and
      the DCC system, short and quick click and releases would
      provide a short blast of the horn or whistle. Holding down
      the button a little longer would produce a longer held blast
      of the whistle.<br>
      The Visible check box allows for the "removal" of unwanted
      buttons. By default, all function buttons are enabled as
      "visible" so that they can obviously be seen. But if there is
      only a single function being used - for example the "lights"
      (F0) - then this option does provide the ability to "hide"
      all of the other buttons.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning!</span> Disabling
      the "Visible" check box should be one of the last steps
      performed during this customization process. The reason for
      this is that once the button is marked as "invisible" (by
      removing the check box), it is indeed invisible to the user
      and therefore can't be right-clicked on with the mouse in
      order to get the "Edit Function Button" window back. To make
      all buttons visible select <a href=
      "ThrottleWindowMenus.shtml">"View-&gt;Show All Function
      Buttons."</a><br>

      <h2>Jynstruments</h2>See <a href=
      "../scripting/Jynstruments.shtml">there for more informations
      about Jynstruments</a>.<br>
      <br>
      The Throttle Window is Jynstrumentable, particularly with
      more advanced function controls.<br>
      <br>
      At the moment <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/jython/Jynstruments/ThrottleFrame/">3 sample
      Jynstruments are delivered</a>, one for Light, one for Horn
      and one for Whistle (function 0, 1 and 2). But this is only a
      sample, have a look at the code and customize at will for
      your specific decoder needs.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Note that Throttle Window
      toolbar is Jynstrumentable too, so here we drop the
      Jynstruments on the window content</span><span style=
      "font-style: italic;">itself, not on the toolbar.</span>
