      <h1>Advanced Throttle Control</h1>

      <h2>Keyboard Control of the Standard Throttle</h2>You can
      operate your JMRI Throttle from the keyboard in addition to
      using a mouse.

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        Throttles in current Window : Alt + left/right<br>
        Throttle Windows : Shift + left/right<br>
      </div><br>
      You can operate the Throttle using your keyboard (the Control
      Panel in the Throttle Window has to be selected):<br>

      <h2>Custom Throttle with Jynstruments</h2><a href=
      "../scripting/Jynstruments.shtml">Jynstruments</a> are
      powerful tools for creating custom JMRI Throttles. There's
      <a href="../scripting/Jynstruments.shtml">much more
      information</a> on creating and customizing them on a
      <a href="../scripting/Jynstruments.shtml">separate page</a>.
      Here, we focus on using the customized Throttles.

      <p><a href=
      "http://jmri.org/jython/Jynstruments/ThrottleWindowToolBar/">Both
      Jynstruments</a> provided below are for controlling already
      assigned Throttles, the Throttle pane you will control has to
      be set up before. Then it's only a matter of drag'n dropping
      a folder on the <a href="ThrottleToolBar.shtml">Throttle
      Window <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">toolbar</span></a>.</p>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note that Throttle
      Window content is Jynstrumentable too, so here we drop the
      Jynstruments on the toolbar itself, not on the window
      content.</span></p>

      <h3>USB Joypad (USBControl.jyn)</h3>There is a Jynstrument
      named USBControl.jyn to be dropped on a Throttle Window
      toolbar to get control of that Window with a joypad. See the
      .py files for default button settings, and possible
      customizations.

      <p>Particularly you might want to define a "driver" file for
      your own device, start from default.py, copy it, rename it
      with the name of the device as seen by JMRI without any space
      or ".", then use <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/jinput/treemodel/TreeFrame.shtml">
      the JMRI Jinput USB Input Control window</a> (accessible from
      Debug menu) to get your Components names and value,</p>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note that a classic
      Jython file exists to take control of a Throttle Window with
      a USB device, this one is more complex but easier to use
      (imho).</span></p>

      <h4>Default controls:</h4>

      <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Browsing throttles:</h5>

      <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        To browse through the currently assigned throttles for the
        controlled window, the pov right and left buttons are used
        (the pov, also known as switch hat, is the four or eight
        directions button on the left of the pad).
      </div>

      <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Speed:</h5>

      <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        Speed is controlled by axis "x" which usually is found on
        the left stick.<br>
        Note that buttons 0 to 3 (or 1 to 4) are assigned to some
        speed presets, from idle (speed 0), to slow (speed 0,3), to
        cruise (speed 0,8), to max (speed 1). A double tap on the
        button for speed 0 will send an emergency stop.
      </div>

      <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Direction:</h5>

      <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        Direction is controlled by axis "z" which usually is found
        on right left stick
      </div>

      <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Functions buttons:</h5>

      <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        All remaining buttons are dedicated to functions (usually
        the one left on the side, under, and in the middle of the
        gamepad)
      </div><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Note that joypads buttons
      layout, and even sticks events differ from one manufacturer
      to another, hence you should customize a driver.py for your
      own hardware.</span>

      <h3>Nintendo Wiimote (WiimoteThrottle.jyn)</h3>There is a
      Jynstrument named WiimoteThrottle.jyn to be dropped on a
      Throttle Window toolbar to get control of that Window with a
      Nintendo Wiimote device. <span style="font-weight: bold;">See
      the .py file for</span> default button settings and
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">set up</span> (some jars are
      to be downloaded and copied in JMRI lib folder).<br style=
      "font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      At the moment, none of the accelerometers of the Wiimote are
      used, hence it's only a kind of deluxe remote as we only use
      the buttons. But it fits very well in one hand and once you
      know the settings, you don't even have to look at it to use
      it.

      <h4>Default controls:</h4>

      <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Browsing throttles:</h5>

      <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        To browse through the currently assigned throttles for the
        controlled window, the left and right buttons are used.
      </div><a name="wii" id="wii"></a>

      <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Speed:</h5>

      <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        Speed is controlled by buttons A (decelerate) and B
        (accelerate)<br>
        Note that buttons 1 and 2 are used for some speed presets,
        from idle (speed 0 - button 2 twice), to slow (speed 0,3 -
        button 2 once), to cruise (speed 0,8 - button 1 once), to
        max (speed 1 - button 1 twice). Pressing buttons 1 and 2
        will send an emergency stop and vibrate the Wiimote.
      </div>

      <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Direction:</h5>

      <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        Direction is controlled by buttons + and -.
      </div>

      <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Functions buttons:</h5>

      <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        Light (function 0) is controlled by Home button.<br>
        And as there is no more buttons available, no other
        function can be controlled by default, but as this is a
        Jython script, feel free to customize, and if somebody is
        able to do something with the accelerometers, you're very
        welcome!
