      <h1>Throttle Menus</h1>

      <h2 id="FileMenu">File menu</h2>
      <img src="images/ThrottlesMenu3.png" alt=""><br>

      <h3>New throttle</h3>
      This menu entry allows to create a new throttle window.<br>

      <h3>Open throttle...</h3>
      This menu entry allows to load a Throttle window layout into the current Throttle Window; it
      will load inner windows properties, and Jynstruments if any.<br>

      <h3>Save current throttle</h3>
      This menu entry allows to save the current Throttle window layout; it will save inner windows
      of the current throttle properties, and Jynstruments if any.<br>
      When a Roster entry is selected, that menu entry is automatically updated. Using it will
      create (or update) a default Throttle file for that Roster entry in &lt;JMRI Preferences
      Folder&gt;/throttle/XYZ.xml where XYZ is the Roster ID.<br>
      <br>
      Note that when saving a Throttle that is the default one for a Roster Entry, Function Buttons
      customization won't be saved in that file, they have to be exported to the Roster Entry (from
      the Edit menu, see below).<br>

      <h3>Save current throttle as...</h3>
      Allows to save the current Throttle window layout using any file name and path. If this
      filename is not the default one for a Roster Entry, then Function Buttons customizations will
      be saved in that file.<br>
      <br>
      It can particularly be used to create the default throttle layout (see <a href="ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">Throttles Preferences</a>)

      <h3>Open throttles layout...</h3>
      This menu entry allows to open a throttle layout, a throttle layout is a set of throttle windows and the throttle lst window, it also contains
      all throttles opened and adressed inside this throttle layout.

      <h3>Save throttles layout...</h3>
      Save a complete throttle layout. Note that this action will only save the layout, not the content of each throttle frame.

      <h3>Open / Save default throttles layout</h3>
      Allows to open/save a default throttle layout, it can be automatically opened on start by a startup action,
      or opened from the main JMRI window, under Actions/Load default throttle layout.

      <h2 id="EditMenu">Edit menu</h2>
      <img src="images/ThrottlesMenu1.png" alt=""><br>

      <h3>Frame Properties</h3>
      <img src="images/ThrottleWindowPreferences.png" alt="ThrottleWindowPreferences.png"><br>
      Allows for editing current Throttle Window properties, particularly the Window title:<br>

      <ul>
        <li>Address - Automatically display the address of whatever locomotive is selected. This is
        the default.</li>

        <li>Text - Display the text that you enter in the field at the top of this window</li>

        <li>Text Address - Display the text you entered, followed by the selected address</li>

        <li>Address Text - Display the selected address, followed by the text you entered</li>

        <li>Roster ID - Display the selected Roster ID</li>
      </ul>
      Note that if you enter text, it won't be visible unless one of the middle three modes is
      selected.<br>

      <h3>Export current throttles customization to roster</h3>
      Push current Throttle window customizations to the Roster, in particular Function Buttons
      customizations. See <a href="RostersMediaPane.shtml">Roster Functions Labels Pane.</a>

      <h3>Throttle preferences</h3>
      Open the see <a href="ThrottlesPreferencesPane.shtml">Throttles Preferences</a> window.

      <h2 id="ViewMenu">View menu</h2>
      <img src="images/ThrottlesMenu2.png" alt=""><br>
      The first part of the "<strong>View</strong>" menu displays a small menu of 3 items - by
      default, each with a check mark preceding the item. This corresponds to the 3 sub-windows
      (Address Panel, Function Panel, & Control Panel) that are part of the throttle window.<br>

      <p>As each sub-window has a minimize and close buttons, if one gets closed down in error,
      this menu option allows you to restore the window again.</p>

      <p>Another way to use this option is when using the features of the Throttles for decoders
      that are <u>not</u> associated with a Locomotive (such as a lighted passenger car or caboose
      or a Fred unit). In these cases, critical screen real estate can be saved by being able to
      disable (or close down) the Control Panel. Be a little creative with the window resizing, and
      you could have several of these custom Throttle windows in the same area as one single
      complete Throttle window would take up.</p>

      <h3>Reset Function Buttons</h3>
      Reset the function buttons content to default and reset their visibility.<br>
      If a Roster is selected, default button content will be loaded from Roster entry,
      and, if the matching preference is enabled, buttons undefined is the Roster entry
      will be hidden.<br>

      <h3>Get all current throttle components in bounds</h3>

      <p>Make sure that all inner windows of the current Throttle are inside the Throttle window
      bounds.</p>
