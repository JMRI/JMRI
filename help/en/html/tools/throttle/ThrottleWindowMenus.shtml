      <h1>Throttle Menus</h1>

      <h2><a name="FileMenu" id="FileMenu">File
      menu</a></h2><img src="images/ThrottlesMenu3.png" alt=
      "" /><br />

      <h3>Load throttle</h3>This menu entry allows to load a
      Throttle window layout into the current Throttle Window; it
      will load inner windows properties, and Jynstruments if
      any.<br />

      <h3>Save current throttle</h3>This menu entry allows to save
      the current Throttle window layout; it will save inner
      windows of the current throttle properties, and Jynstruments
      if any.<br />
      When a Roster entry is selected, that menu entry is
      automatically enabled. Using it will create (or update) a
      default Throttle file for that Roster entry in &lt;JMRI
      Preferences Folder&gt;/throttle/XYZ.xml where XYZ is the
      Roster ID.<br />
      <br />
      Note that when saving a Throttle that is the default one for
      a Roster Entry, Function Buttons customization won't be saved
      in that file, they have to be exported to the Roster Entry
      (from the Edit menu, see below).<br />

      <h3>Save current throttle as...</h3>Allows to save the
      current Throttle window layout using any file name and path.
      If this filename is not the default one for a Roster Entry,
      then Function Buttons customizations will be saved in that
      file.<br />

      <h2><a name="EditMenu" id="EditMenu">Edit
      menu</a></h2><img src="images/ThrottlesMenu1.png" alt=
      "" /><br />

      <h3>Frame Properties</h3><img src=
      "images/ThrottleWindowPreferences.png" alt=
      "ThrottleWindowPreferences.png" /><br />
      Allows for editing current Throttle Window properties,
      particularly the Window title:<br />

      <ul>
        <li>Address - Automatically display the address of whatever
        locomotive is selected. This is the default.</li>

        <li>Text - Display the text that you enter in the field at
        the top of this window</li>

        <li>Text Address - Display the text you entered, followed
        by the selected address</li>

        <li>Address Text - Display the selected address, followed
        by the text you entered</li>

        <li>Roster ID - Display the selected Roster ID</li>
      </ul>Note that if you enter text, it won't be visible unless
      one of the middle three modes is selected.<br />

      <h3>Reset Function Buttons</h3>Reset the function buttons
      content to default and reset their visibility.<br />
      If a Roster is selected, default button content will be
      loaded from Roster entry; furthermore, if the matching
      preference is enabled, buttons undefined is the Roster entry
      will be hidden.<br />

      <h3>Export current throttles customization to roster</h3>Push
      current Throttle window customizations to the Roster, in
      particular Function Buttons customizations. See <a href=
      "RostersMediaPane.shtml" name="EditMenu" id="EditMenu">Roster
      Functions Labels Pane.</a>

      <h2><a name="ViewMenu" id="ViewMenu">View
      menu</a></h2><img src="images/ThrottlesMenu2.png" alt=
      "" /><br />
      The first part of the "<big>View</big>" menu displays a small
      menu of 3 items - by default, each with a check mark
      preceding the item. This corresponds to the 3 sub-windows
      (Address Panel, Function Panel, &amp; Control Panel) that are
      part of the throttle window.<br />

      <p>As each sub-window has a minimize and close buttons, if
      one gets closed down in error, this menu option allows you to
      restore the window again.</p>

      <p>Another way to use this option is when using the features
      of the Throttles for decoders that are <u>not</u> associated
      with a Locomotive (such as a lighted passenger car or caboose
      or a Fred unit). In these cases, critical screen real estate
      can be saved by being able to disable (or close down) the
      Control Panel. Be a little creative with the window resizing,
      and you could have several of these custom Throttle windows
      in the same area as one single complete Throttle window would
      take up.</p>

      <h3>Show all function buttons</h3>Note: this functionality
      was moved to "Reset Function Buttons" in the <a href=
      "#EditMenu">"Edit" menu</a>

      <h3>Get all current throttle components in bounds</h3>

      <p>Make sure that all inner windows of the current Throttle
      are inside the Throttle Window bounds.</p>
