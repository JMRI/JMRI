      <h1>JMRI: ID Tags Documentation</h1>

      <h2>What are ID Tags?</h2>

      <p>An ID Tag is JMRI's way of representing information about
      ID Tags that can be attached to, for example, various items
      of rolling stock.</p>

      <p>When an ID Tag is read by a suitable reader, this is
      notified via both a <a href="Sensors.shtml">Sensor</a>
      becoming ACTIVE and a <a href="Reporters.shtml">Reporter</a>
      being set to the value of the ID Tag. The ID Tag will also
      record both by which Reporter it was last seen by, as well as
      the time it was last seen.</p>

      <p>If an unknown ID Tag is detected by a reader, details of
      this tag will be automatically entered into the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/IdTagTable.shtml">ID Tag
      Table</a>.</p>

      <p>At system shutdown, the details of all ID Tags known to
      the system are written to a file stored in the "idtags"
      sub-directory of user <a href=
      "../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Preferences</a>.
      The storage of details when and where a given ID Tag was last
      seen is configurable by setting the option at the bottom of
      the ID Tag Table.</p>

      <p>Current implementations are for CORE-ID based readers.
      These are supported in stand-alone mode via the 'Generic
      Stand-alone' protocol and as an up-to 8-way Concentrator
      using <a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/">MERG</a> hardware via
      the 'MERG Concentrator' protocol.<br>
      Note: The <a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/">MERG</a> starter
      kit as supplied should be configured using the 'Generic
      Stand-alone' protocol - only when extending the kit with the
      additional concentrator components should the 'MERG
      Concentrator' protocol be used.</p>

      <h2>How to setup ID Tags</h2>

      <h3>ID Tag Table</h3>

      <p>The <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/IdTagTable.shtml">ID Tag
      Table</a> provides easy access to the contents of all ID Tags
      that JMRI knows about.</p>

      <h3>ID Tag Table Controls</h3>

      <p>Below the table there's an <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/IdTagAddEdit.shtml">"Add..."
      button</a> for creating your own ID Tags; JMRI automatically
      creates ID Tag objects for tags detected on the layout.</p>

      <p>Next to it, two check boxes let you activate:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Save when and where last seen</li>

        <li>Use Fast Clock Time</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Displaying ID Tags on Panels</h3>

      <p>An ID Tag can be displayed on a Panel via the use of the
      Reporter Icon associated with a given reader. To do this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>On the Panel Editor window for your Panel, find the
        "Add Reporter" button.</li>

        <li>In the text box next to that button, type the User Name
        or System Name of the desired Reporter.</li>

        <li>Click the button. The Reporter icon will be placed on
        the Panel. If it's not visible, that might be because the
        value is currently blank; use the Reporter Table to change
        the value to something that will be visible.</li>

        <li>You can drag the icon to where you want it in the usual
        way.</li>

        <li>The pop-up menu on the Reporter Icon will let you
        change the formatting.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>More information about Reporters can be found in the
      <a href="Reporters.shtml">Reporters help page</a>.</p>

      <h3>Saving ID Tags to disk</h3>

      <p>ID Tags are part of your
      <i>layout configuration</i>, along with
        your Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads, Lights, control panel
        setup etc. To store this information on disk, allowing to
        <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload
        it</a> next time you run JMRI, use <b>Store Configuration...</b>
        in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the ID Tag Table (or
        other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store
        Panel...</b> in the <b>Panel</b> menu. To open them, open the panel containing the ID Tags. The data is
      stored in a folder named "idtags". Note that the
        contents of an ID Tag is not saved in the
        configuration file.</p>
