		JMRI: Scripting FAQ
        </H1>

		<p class=subtitle>
		    Frequently asked questions about scripting JMRI
		    with Jython
		</p>

		    <h2>Where can I learn more about the Jython language?</h2>

		    <div class=para>
		    
		    <p>See the
		    <A HREF="Python.shtml">Python &amp; JMRI</a>
		    page for more info, including pointers to articles, etc.
		    See also the navigation links to the left.
            </div>
            
		    <h2>How do Jython and Python differ?</h2>

		    <div class=para>
		    
		    <p>For the purposes of writing JMRI scripts, they
		    don't differ very much.  Most of the differences involve
		    what happens in somewhat contrived error cases.
		    There are also some restrictions
		    on what you can do with the computer's configuration
		    information, etc, in Jython, but these are not things
		    a JMRI script is likely to need.</p>
		    <P>Some additional information on the differences
		    is 
		    <A HREF="http://jython.sourceforge.net/docs/differences.html">available here</a>.
		    </div>

		    <h2>Where can I find some examples of JMRI scripts?</h2>

		    <div class=para>
		    
		    See the 
		    <a href="Examples.shtml">examples page</a>.
		    Also, the
		    <a href="Start.shtml">introductory page</a>
		    shows some of the basic commands.
		    </div>

		    <h2>What do those words like 
		    "<code>import</code>",
		    "<code>class</code>", etc, in the example files mean?
		    </h2>

		    <div class=para>
            They're part of the jython language used for the scripting.
            <P>
            The imports allow you to refer to things by shorter names, 
            essentially telling jython "search the jarray, jmri packages and 
            recognize all the names there".   For somebody trying to understand 
            this script, you can just treat them as "ensuring the program can 
            find parts we want".
            <P>
            "class" means "start the definition of a group of things that go 
            together"  (all you other experts, please don't jump on me about 
            this; I understand both intrinsic/extrinsic polymorphism, I'm just 
            trying to get the general idea across).  
            <P>
            For example, in the SigletExample.py file is a description of a 
            "class" called SigletExample, which contains two 
            routines/functions/members:  A subroutine called "defineIO", and one 
            called "setOutput"
            <P>
            This "class" is associated with another called "Siglet" (actually 
            jmri.jmrit.automat.Siglet; that's that long naming thing again), 
            which knows when to invoke routines by those two names to get done 
            what you want.
            <P>
            Essentially, you're defining two parts ("defineIO" & "setOutput") 
            that plug into a pre-existing structure to drive signals.  That 
            pre-existing structure is very powerful, and lets you do all sorts of 
            things, but also provides this method to try to keep it simpler.
            <P>
            OK, at this point most people's eyes are fully glazed over.  Your 
            best bet when starting with this stuff is to use the "copy and 
            modify" approach to software development.  It's good to try to 
            understand the entire content of the file, but don't worry about 
            understanding it well enough to be able to recreate it from scratch. 
            Instead, just modify little bits and play with it.
		    </div>

		    <h2>Where can I find more information on the JMRI classes?</h2>

		    <div class=para>
		    
		    The 
		    <a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/">class documentation pages</a> 
		    include automatically-built summary information
		    on every class.
		    <p>
		    There are a lot of classes!  To help you find things,
		    it might be useful to look at the 
		    <a href="../../doc/Technical/Patterns.shtml">page on JMRI structure</a>,
		    which is part of the 
		    <a href="../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">JMRI technical documentation</a>.
		    Note the references on the left-hand side.
		    </div>


		    <h2>Are there required naming conventions?</h2>

		    <div class=para>
            In many of the sample files, turnouts are referred to by 
            names like "to12", signals by names like "si21",
            and sensors by names like "bo45". These conventions grew out of 
            how some older code was
            written, and they can make the code clearer.  
            But they are in no way required; the
            program doesn't care what you call variables.
            <P>
            For example, "self.to12" is just the name of a variable.  
            You can call it anything 
            you want, e.g. self.MyBigFatNameForTheLeftTurnout
            <P>
            The "self" part makes it completely local; "self" refers to "an 
            object of the particular class I'm defining right now".  Alternately, 
            you can define a global variable, but that's not recommended.  If you 
            have multiple scripts running (and you can have as many as you'd 
            like; we recommend that you put each signal head in a separate one), 
            the variables can get confused if you use the same variable name to 
            mean too different things.  Using "self" like this one does makes 
            sure that doesn't happen.
            <P>
            Note that turnouts, etc, do have "System Names" that look like 
            "LT12".  You'll see those occasionally, but that's something 
            different from the variable names in a script file.		   
            </div>

		<a name="windows">
		    <h2>Can a script access the JMRI application windows?</h2>

		    <div class=para>
            Your scripts can change the properties of all the main 
            JMRI windows. They're all jmri.util.JmriJFrame objects,
            so they have all the various methods of a Swing JFrame.
            For example, this code snippet
            <p>
            <code>
            window = jmri.util.JmriJFrame.getFrameList()[1]<br/>
            window.setLocation(java.awt.Point(0,0))
            </code>
            <p>
            locates the application's main window, and sets its 
            location to the upper left corner of the screen.
            <p>
            The <code>jmri.util.JmriJFrame.getFrameList()</code>
            call in the first line returns a list of the existing 
            windows. The [0] element of this list is the original
            splash screen and the [1] element is the main window;
            after that, they're the various windows in the order they
            are created.  To find a particular one, you can
            index through the list checking e.g. the window's title
            with the <code>getTitle()</code> method.
            
            </div>

		    <h2>What's the difference between the "Siglet" and "AbstractAutomaton" classes?</h2>

		    <div class=para>
            (Maybe not a <em>frequently</em> asked question, but it needs
            to go somewhere)
            <P>
            Some examples use the 
            <A HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/AbstractAutomaton.html">AbstractAutomaton</a>
            class as a base, while
            others use the 
            <A HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/Siglet.html">Siglet</a>
            class. This is because those are intended for two different 
            purposes.
            <P>
            "Siglet" is meant to be used for driving signals.  You
            provide two pieces of code:
            <dl>
            <dt>defineIO<DD>which defines the various sensors, turnouts
            and signals that the output signal depends on as input when
            calculating the appearance of the signal.
            <dt>setOutout<dd>which recalculates the signal appearance
            from the defined inputs.
            </dl>
            <P>The Siglet base class then handles all of the listening
            for changes, setting up for parallel execution, etc. Your
            defineIO routine will be called once at the beginning, and 
            after than any time one or more of the inputs changes, your setOutput
            routine will be called to recalculate the signal appearance.
            <P>
            Of course, you can use this class to calculate other things than
            signal appearances.  But the key element is that the calculation
            is redone when the inputs change, and only when the inputs change.
            <P>
            AbstractAutomaton is a more general class that's intended
            to allow more powerful operations (and Siglet actually
            uses that more powerful base).  You define two functions:
            <DL>
            <DT>init<DD>which is called exactly once to do any one-time
            setup you need
            <DT>handle<DD>which is called over and over and over again
            until it returns FALSE.
            </DL>
            
            Using AbstractAutomoton provides you with a number of 
            tools:  you can wait for a particular sensor to go
            active, do something, then wait for a different sensor
            to go inactive, etc.  This allows you much more freedom to
            create complicated &amp; powerful sequences than the Siglet class,
            because Siglets are limited to doing just one thing (they aren't
            intended to do sequences of operations).
            <P>
            For more info on the routines that AbstractAutomaton provides
            to help you, see the 
            <A HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/AbstractAutomaton.html#method_summary">JavaDocs</a>
            for the class. (Scroll down to the section called "Method Summary")
            </div>

		    <h2>How can I limit the priority of a script?</h2>

		    <div class=para>
            <P>If the script runs a loop that's supposed to update something, it 
            can't be written to run continuously or else it will just suck up as 
            much computer time as it can.  Rather, it should wait.

            <P>The best thing to do is to wait for something to change.  For 
            example, if your script looks at some sensors to decide what to do, 
            wait for one of those sensors to change (see the sample scripts for 
            examples)

            <P>Simpler, but not as efficient, is to just wait for a little while 
            before checking again. For example
<PRE>
    waitMsec(1000)
</PRE>
            causes an automaton or Siglet script to wait for 
            1000 milliseconds (one second) before continuing.
            <P>
            For just a simple script, something that doesn't use the
            Automat or Siglet classes, you can sleep by doing
            
<PRE>
from time import sleep
sleep(10)
</PRE>
            The first line defines the "sleep" routine, and only needs
            to be done once.  The second line then sleeps for 10 seconds.
            Note that the accuracy of this method is not as good as
            using one of the special classes.
		    </div>

<h2>How do I load a panel file from within a script?</h2>

<div class="para"><code>
<pre>jmri.InstanceManager.configureManagerInstance().load(java.io.File("filename.xml"))</pre>
</code></div>

That looks for "filename.xml" in the JMRI program directory, which is
not a good place to keep your files. (They tend to get lost or damaged
when JMRI is updated). See the next question for a solution to this.

<h2>How do I find a file in the preferences directory?</h2>

You can always specify the complete pathname to a file, e.g. 
<code>C:\Documents and Files\mine\JMRI\filename.xml</code> or
<code>/Users/mine/.jmri/filename.xml</code>.
This is not very portable from computer to computer, however, and
can become a pain to keep straight.

<p>
JMRI provides a routine to convert "portable" names to names your 
computer will recognize:

<div class="para"><code>
<pre>fullname = decodeJmriFilename("preference:filename.xml")</pre>
</code></div>

The "<code>preference:</code>" means to look for that file starting in the preferences
directory on the current computer. Other choices are "program:" and "home:", see the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/FileUtil.html#getExternalFilename(java.lang.String)">documentation</a>.

<h2>How do I invoke another script file from a script?</h2>

<div class="para">
<pre>execfile("filename.py")</pre>
</div>

That will look for the file in the top-level JMRI program directory, which 
might now be what you want.  If you want JMRI to search for the file in the 
default scripts directory (which you can set in preferences), use the slightly
more complex form:

<div class="para">
<pre>execfile(decodeJmriFilename("scripts:filename.py"))</pre>
</div>

The call to decodeJmriFilename(..) translates the string using JMRI's standard
prefixes. The "scripts:" tells JMRI to search in the default scripts directory.
You can also use other prefixes, see the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/util/FileUtil.html#getExternalFilename(java.lang.String)">documentation</a>.

<h2>Can I communicate between scripts?</h2>

<div class="para">
All scripts share a single address space, which means that a variable like "x"
refers to the same location in all scripts. This allows you to define a
procedure, for example, in one script, and use it elsewhere. For example, if a
"definitions.py" file contained: 
<pre>def printStatus() :
  print "x is", x
  print "y is", y
  print "z is", z
  return

x = 0
y = 0
z = 0</pre>
Once that file has been executed, any later script can invoke the
<code>printStatus()</code> routine whenever needed. </div>

<div class="para">
You can also share variables, which allows two routines to share information.
In the example above, the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>
variables are available to anybody. This can lead to obscure bugs if two
different routines are using a variable of the same name, without realizing
that they are sharing data with each other. Putting your code into "classes" is
a way to avoid that. </div>

<h2>Can a script wait for more than one thing to change?</h2>

<div class="para">
If your script is based on a Siglet or AbstractAutomaton class (e.g. if you're
writing a "handle" routine", there's a general "waitChange" routine which waits
for any of several sensors to change before returning to you. Note that more
than one may change at the same time, so you can't assume that just one has a
different value! And you'll then have to check whether they've become some
particular state. It's written as: 
<pre>    self.waitChange([self.sensorA, self.sensorB, self.sensorC])</pre>
where you've previously defined each of those "self.sensorA" things via a line
like: 
<pre>    self.sensorA = sensors.provideSensor("21")</pre>
You can then check for various combinations like: 
<pre>   if self.sensorA.knownState == ACTIVE :
        print "The plane! The plane!"
   elif self.sensorB.knownState == INACTIVE :
        print "Would you believe a really fast bird?"
   else
        print "Nothing to see here, move along..."</pre>
(I haven't actually typed these into a script &amp; run it, so there might be
typos, sorry) </div>

<h2>Can a script listen to more than one Turnout?</h2>

<div class="para">
JMRI objects (Turnouts, Sensors, etc) can have "Listeners" attached to them.
These are then notified when the status of the object changes. If you're using
the Automat or Siglet classes, you don't need to use this capability; those
classes handle all the creationg and registering of listeners. But if you want
to do something special, you may need to use that capability. 

<p>A single routine can listen to more than one Turnout, Sensor, etc. </p>

<p>If you retain a reference to your listener object, you can attach it to more
than one object: </p>
<pre>m = MyListener()
turnouts.provideTurnout("12").addPropertyChangeListener(m)
turnouts.provideTurnout("13").addPropertyChangeListener(m)
turnouts.provideTurnout("14").addPropertyChangeListener(m)</pre>

<p>But how does the listener know what changed? </p>

<p>A listener routine looks like this: </p>
<pre>class MyListener(java.beans.PropertyChangeListener):
  def propertyChange(self, event):
    print "change",event.propertyName
    print "from", event.oldValue, "to", event.newValue
    print "source systemName", event.source.systemName
    print "source userName", event.source.userName</pre>

<p>When the listener is called, it's given an object (called event above) that
contains the name of the property that changed, plus the old and new values of
that property. </p>

<p>You can also get a reference to the original object that changed via "name",
and then do whatever you'd like through that. In the example above, you can
retrieve the systemName, userName (or even other types of status). </p>


<h2>How can I get a script to play a sound?</h2>

The jython/SampleSound.py file shows how to play a sound within a script.
Briefly, you load a sound into a variable ("snd" in this case), then call
"play()" to play it once, etc. 

<p>Note that if more than one sound is playing at a time, the program combines
them as best it can. Generally, it does a pretty good job. </p>

<p>You can combine the play() call with other logic to play a sound when a
Sensor changes, etc. Ron McKinnon provided an example of doing this. It plays a
railroad crossing bell when the sensor goes active. </p>
<pre>
# It listens for changes to a sensor,
# and then plays a sound file when sensor active

import jarray
import jmri

# create the sound object by loading a file
snd = jmri.jmrit.Sound("resources/sounds/Crossing.wav")

class SensndExample(jmri.jmrit.automat.Siglet) :

        # Modify this to define all of your turnouts, sensors and 
        # signal heads.
        def defineIO(self):
                
                # get the sensor 
                self.Sen1Sensor = sensors.provideSensor("473")
                                
                 # Register the inputs so setOutput will be called when needed.
                 self.setInputs(jarray.array([self.Sen1Sensor], jmri.NamedBean))

                return

        # setOutput is called when one of the inputs changes, and is
        # responsible for setting the correct output
        #
        # Modify this to do your calculation.
        def setOutput(self):
                                
                if self.Sen1Sensor.knownState==ACTIVE:
                        snd.play()

                return
        
# end of class definition

# start one of these up
SensndExample().start()
</pre>
