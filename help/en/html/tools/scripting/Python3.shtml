		    <p>JMRI's support for Python 3 is under development.  We expect
		       there to be changes before its production release in JMRI 5.</p>

		    <p class="important"><span class="since">Since <a href="https://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri4.99.2.shtml">JMRI 4.99.2</a></span>
		    	Python 3 support is only available in JMRI test release 4.99.2 or later.
		    	Make sure to check the release notes of the JMRI version you're using!
		    </p>
		    <p class="important">
		        This support is experimental; we may still encounter killer problems that we're not
		        able to solve.  Please feel free to experiment with it, but don't i.e.
		        write scripts that are critical to your railroad's operation using Python 3.
		    <p>
		        Please note that Python 3 support is currently only available for macOS and Linux
		        computers.  Some of the components it requires are not year available for Windows.
		        We'll update to use them and make Windows support available as soon as those
		        components are updated.

	    <h1>Python 3 Introduction</h1>
		<div class="section">
		    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            JMRI's Python 3 support is provided, in part,
            by running on a
            <a href="https://www.graalvm.org">GraalVM</a>
            virtual machine instead of the usual
            Java Runtime Environment.
            The first step is to install a GraalVM on your computer.
            <p>
            To do that, follow
            <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#install-graalvm">the GraalVM install instructions</a>
            to install a Java 11 version.
            <p>
            Once you do that and start JMRI, a "Python 3" choice should appear in the
            language selector in the Script Input Window, and the file choosers for
            running scripts should give you a similar choice.
            <p>
            Our convention is that Python 3 files use a .py3 extension.

		    <h2>Issues and differences from Jython (Python 2.7)</h2>

            <ul>
            <li>Scripts should start with
                <pre><code class="block">
    import jmri as jmri
    import java
    exec( open("jython/jmri_bindings.py3").read() )
            </code></pre>
                The third line is the Py3 syntax to read and execute another script file.
                In this case, it reads and executes the file that defines a number of
                symbols like `THROWN``, `turnouts`, etc.
            <li>
                The syntax for getting a class reference has changed.  The only
                place you're likely to see that is in InstanceManager calls.  They become:
                <pre><code class="block">
    manager = jmri.InstanceManager.getNullableDefault('jmri.MyManager')
                </code></pre>
                (note quotes).  More generally, if you need access to a Java type
                object for other purposes, you can get it with
                <pre><code class="block">
    java.type('jmri.MyManager')
                </code></pre>
                but we've provided a new version of InstanceManager.getDefault and
                InstanceManager.getNullableDefault that takes the class name as
                a parameter to make those common operations simpler.

            <li>
                Print statements need to have their value enclosed in parentheses:
                <pre><code class="block">
    print (123)
            </code></pre>

            <li>
                Constants are not inherited:
                You have to reference <code>DigitalIO.ON</code>, not <code>Light.ON</code>.

            <li>
                Unlike Jython, JMRI's Python 3 can address (almost) any of the
                Python libraries you have installed on your computer.

            <li>
                You can inherit a Python class from a Java class, i.e.
                <pre><code class="block">
class Automat(AbstractAutomaton) :
    def init(self) :
        print ("init in Python 3")
    def handle(self) :
        print ("handle in Python 3")
        return False
                </code></pre>
                but when you're doing that you can't add any additional
                methods to the new class.  This might require rethinking
                how to connect Java class code to your own scripting code;
                we hope to have some recommendations soon.

            <li>There's a problem with the various
                <code>wait</code> calls in <code>AbstractAutomaton</code>,
                e.g. <code>waitMsec(..)</code> and similar,
                that can result in JMRI locking up. We don't currently
                have a workaround for this.

            <li>The "syntax error" message doesn't tell you where the
                error was found.  This is a real pain.
