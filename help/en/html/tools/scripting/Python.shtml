      <h1>JMRI: The Python/Jython language</h1><a href=
      "http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> is a widely used scripting
      language that's available on many types of computers. A
      Java-based variant, called <a href=
      "http://www.jython.org" target="_blank">Jython</a>, has been integrated with
      JMRI to make it easy to control a model railroad from the
      command line of a computer. For our purposes, the two
      languages are completely the same.

      <p>If like me you prefer to read off paper, there are lots of
      books available on Python. Perhaps one of the best for
      beginners is <a href=
      "http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpython2/" target="_blank">"Learning
      Python"</a> published by O'Reilly. It contains more than you
      really need to know, though.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.jython.org" target="_blank">jython.org site</a>
      has some introductory information, though their <a href=
      "http://www.python.org/doc/tut/tut.html" target="_blank">tutorial</a> spends
      too much time on the engineering details at the beginning.
      You might want to skip to the <a href=
      "http://www.python.org/doc/tut/node5.html" target="_blank">part about the
      language itself</a>.</p>

      <p>Non-programmers might want to start with some of the
      <a href="http://www.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide" target="_blank">resources
      for them</a> listed on the python website.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in the underlying technicalities of
      the language, IBM Developerworks has two good articles
      <a href=
      "http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jython.html" target="_blank">
      here</a> and <a href=
      "http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-alj07064/" target="_blank">
      here</a>. They also have a nice tutorial <a href=
      "http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/edu/j-dw-java-jython1-i.html?S_TACT=104AHW02" target="_blank">
      here</a>, although they require you to register with your
      email address to access it.</p>

      <p>Looking at the examples in the "jython" directory in the JMRI distribution will also be of value.
      See the <a href="Examples.shtml">examples page</a> for links to these sample scripts. </p>

        <h2>How do Jython and Python differ?</h2>

      <div class="para">
        <p>For the purposes of writing JMRI scripts, they don't
        differ very much. Most of the differences involve what
        happens in somewhat contrived error cases. There are also
        some restrictions on what you can do with the computer's
        configuration information, etc, in Jython, but these are
        not things a JMRI script is likely to need.</p>

        <p>Some additional information on the differences is
        <a href=
        "http://jython.sourceforge.net/docs/differences.html" target="_blank">available
        here</a>.</p>
      </div>

            
      <h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROGRAM FORMATTING: INDENTATION MATTERS</h2>
      <div class="para">      
      The single
      oddest thing about Python is that the indentation matters.
      Instead of using { and } characters to indicate the beginning
      and end of a block or function, that's done with indentation
      in Python. 
      Of course, in a C-like language people usually
      indent blocks anyway, but it takes a little getting used to
      that you <em>have</em> to do it in Python.
      You should indent with four spaces for each level
      in your code.
      (Four is a convention, but it really helps readability; 
      using tabs can cause lots of confusion and is not recommended.
      Mixing spaces and tabs is likely to cause lots of confusion; 
      please don't do that)

      <p>For example, this is a syntax error:</p>
      <pre>
   a = 15
      print a
   b = 21  
</pre>

because those statements, though logically grouped at the
same level in the program, aren't indented the same. This sounds
like a pain at first, but you rapidly get used to it. Then it makes
things like the following pretty easy to read, without having to
worry about where the { and } go:
      <pre>
        if ( now == -1 ) :
                done = 1
        else :
                done = 0
        print done 
</pre>

If you do get a message about "Syntax error", look at the
indicated line number to see if your indentation isn't lined up.

        <h2>Is JMRI's support for Python complete?</h2>JMRI
        scripting uses <a href="http://www.jython.org" target="_blank">Jython</a>, a Java-implemented
        form of the Python language. The basic language is pretty
        complete, but not all of the Python libraries are
        available. Some "import" statements that you might read in
        a book might not work because of missing libraries.

        <p>Support is improving all the time, though, and you might
        want to try a more modern version of Jython than the one
        that JMRI distributes. To do that, install Jython on you
        computer, then add a python.properties file in your 
        <a href="../../setup/Files.shtml">user files directory</a>
        or
        <a href="../../setup/Files.shtml">preferences directory</a>
        that sets the python configuration variables,
        e.g. on Windows:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
python.path = C:\\jython2.7.0\\Lib\\site\-packages
python.startup = 
</pre>
<p>Note that the double-back-slashes are necessary.  They'll appear as single-back-slashes
in the final value, which you can check with the "Context" item from the main JMRI
Help menu. On Mac use something like:</p>
<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
python.path = /Users/username/jython2.7.0/Lib/site-packages
python.startup = 
</pre>
or where-ever you've installed the new Jython. Linux is similar.
