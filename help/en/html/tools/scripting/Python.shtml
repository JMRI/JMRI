      <h1>JMRI: The Python/Jython language</h1><a href=
      "http://www.python.org">Python</a> is a widely used scripting
      language that's available on many types of computers. A
      Java-based variant, called <a href=
      "http://www.jython.org">Jython</a>, has been integrated with
      JMRI to make it easy to control a model railroad from the
      command line of a computer. For our purposes, the two
      languages are completely the same.

      <p>If like me you prefer to read off paper, there are lots of
      books available on Python. Perhaps one of the best for
      beginners is <a href=
      "http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpython2/">"Learning
      Python"</a> published by O'Reilly. It contains more than you
      really need to know, though.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.jython.org">jython.org site</a>
      has some introductory information, though their <a href=
      "http://www.python.org/doc/tut/tut.html">tutorial</a> spends
      too much time on the engineering details at the beginning.
      You might want to skip to the <a href=
      "http://www.python.org/doc/tut/node5.html">part about the
      language itself</a>.</p>

      <p>Non-programmers might want to start with some of the
      <a href="http://www.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide">resources
      for them</a> listed on the python website.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in the underlying technicalities of
      the language, IBM Developerworks has two good articles
      <a href=
      "http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jython.html">
      here</a> and <a href=
      "http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-alj07064/">
      here</a>. They also have a nice tutorial <a href=
      "http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/edu/j-dw-java-jython1-i.html?S_TACT=104AHW02">
      here</a>, although they require you to register with your
      email address to access it.</p>

      <p>Looking at the examples in the "jython" directory in the
      JMRI distribution might also help.</p>

      <h3>Things somebody should point out to you</h3>The single
      oddest thing about Python is that the indentation matters.
      Instead of using { and } characters to indicate the beginning
      and end of a block or function, that's done with indentation
      in Python. Of course, in a C-like language people usually
      indent blocks anyway, but it takes a little getting used to
      that you <em>have</em> to do it in Python.

      <p>For example, this is a syntax error:</p>
      <pre>
   a = 15
      print a
   b = 21
   
</pre>because those statements, though logically grouped at the
same level in the program, aren't indented the same. This sounds
like a pain at first, but you rapidly get used to it. Then it makes
things like the following pretty easy to read, without having to
worry about where the { and } go:
      <pre>
        if ( now == -1 ) :
                done = 1
        else :
                done = 0
        print done
 
</pre>If you do get a message about "Syntax error", look at the
indicated line number to see if your indentation isn't lined up.
