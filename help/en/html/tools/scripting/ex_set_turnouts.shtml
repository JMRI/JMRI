      <h2>JMRI: Scripts To Go...<br>
      Setting the Default State of Turnouts</h2>

      <div class="section">
        <p>(Example contributed by Jerry Britton)</p>

        <p>My layout, the <a href="http://jbritton.pennsyrr.com/"
        target="new">Pennsylvania Railroad Eastern Region</a>,
        already features over a hundred turnouts, with many more to
        come. At this time, and for the foreseeable future, the
        turnouts do not provide feedback; it's an expense I am not
        ready to incur.</p>

        <p>I've developed <a href=
        "http://jbritton.pennsyrr.com/control_panels.ws4d" target=
        "new">PanelPro panels</a> for a pair of dispatchers to use
        to control the railroad. PanelPro issues turnout commands
        via LocoNet (Digitrax system). Turnouts are powered by
        Tortoise switch machines which are controlled by NCE
        SwitchIt stationary decoders which monitor LocoNet for
        commands.</p>

        <p>The problem is, without detection on the turnouts
        themselves, every time PanelPro is opened for the first
        time, all of the turnouts show a "?" state, meaning
        PanelPro doesn't know their current state.</p>

        <p>Until now, I've invested a considerable amount of time
        to manually click on each and every turnout to set its
        state -- any state -- then set it to the desired state.
        I've suggested that a default state field be added to the
        Turnout Table -- and maybe we'll see that in the future --
        but for now my need may be met via a script. Perhaps you'll
        have a need it can meet as well.</p>

        <p>The reason for this web page is that I am a model
        railroader that uses JMRI. Our very talented programming
        team is made up of programmers that are also model
        railroaders. When I asked "How do I...", I received far
        more information than I needed or desired. I have no
        interest in becoming a programmer or learning exactly how
        it "works". I just have a need that I would like to be met
        with a minimal amount of effort. It was a classic example
        of asking for the time and being instructed how to build a
        watch!</p>

        <p>So here it is, a down and dirty script that you can
        copy, make simple edits for your own use, and start using
        immediately -- without having to know "how" it works.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>The Script</h2>
        <pre>
class setStartup(jmri.jmrit.automat.AbstractAutomaton) :
   def init(self):
     return
   def handle(self):
     self.waitMsec(10000)         # time is in milliseconds
     turnouts.provideTurnout("1").setState(CLOSED)
     self.waitMsec(1000)
     turnouts.provideTurnout("17").setState(CLOSED)
     self.waitMsec(1000)
     turnouts.provideTurnout("9").setState(CLOSED)
     self.waitMsec(1000)
     return False              # all done, don't repeat again
setStartup().start()          # create one of these, and start it running                   
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Making Use of the Script</h2>

        <p>You should "copy" and "paste" the sample script into a
        new text document. Be sure the file is indeed saved as a
        generic text document, and not something like a Microsoft
        Word file. The file suffix should be ".py" for Python, the
        command language used by JMRI.</p>

        <p>Save the file where JMRI can access it. I save mine in
        the same directory as my PanelPro files.</p>

        <p>It is VERY IMPORTANT that you keep the formatting of the
        script the way it is -- with leading tabs. The Python
        language uses indentation as part of its command structure. 
        [While this script is made with leading tabs, it is recommended
        that scripts used with JMRI use four spaces instead as tabs sometimes
        cause confusion.  And NEVER mix the use of tabs and spaces for
        indentation as it will definitely cause confusion with program 
        indentation and structure.] </p>

        <p>This first part of the script you should include "as
        is". No changes are necessary:</p>
        <pre>
class setStartup(jmri.jmrit.automat.AbstractAutomaton) :
   def init(self):
     return
   def handle(self):
     self.waitMsec(10000)         # time is in milliseconds
</pre>

        <p>The following part of the script is what you need to
        modify for your own use. Below are commands to set the
        state for three turnouts; each consists of two lines.</p>

        <p>The first line includes a number in quotations which is
        the turnout number (decoder ID) that you wish to send the
        command to. The state in parenthesis at the end of the line
        (CLOSED or THROWN) is the position you want the turnout set
        to.</p>

        <p>The second line adds a delay between commands, in
        milliseconds. If you have a lot of turnouts to set, your
        power supply would likely not be able to handle throwing
        them all at once. The delay allows the activations to be
        spread out over time. Dozens of turnouts may be set over a
        period of a minute or two.</p>

        <p>So "paste" multiple instances of the two line commands
        into your script as desired. You may also add comment lines
        (beginning with a "#") to document sections of your
        layout.</p>
        <pre>
     turnouts.provideTurnout("1").setState(CLOSED)
     self.waitMsec(1000)
     turnouts.provideTurnout("17").setState(CLOSED)
     self.waitMsec(1000)
     turnouts.provideTurnout("9").setState(CLOSED)
     self.waitMsec(1000)
</pre>

        <p>The closing part of the script should also be left "as
        is":</p>
        <pre>
     return False              # all done, don't repeat again
setStartup().start()          # create one of these, and start it running                   
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Implementing the Script</h2>

        <p>With track power on, you can execute the script by
        selecting Run Script from the PanelPro menu of JMRI. There
        will be a delay before script execution begins, but then
        you will see your turnouts throwing one by one.</p>

        <p>You can also select the script to run automatically when
        PanelPro is launched by selecting the script file in
        Advanced Preferences. Be sure track power is on before
        launching PanelPro in this case.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Credit Where Credit Is Due</h2>

        <p>My unending praise goes to the many developers who
        provide JMRI to the model railroad community. However, in
        the case of meeting my need in setting the default state of
        turnouts, I wish to extend my gratitude to "breezlys" of
        the JMRI Forum community; he provided the sample script,
        which I believe he interpreted and modified from JMRI's
        sample scripts.</p>
