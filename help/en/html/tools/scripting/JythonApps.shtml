      <h1>JMRI: Jython Apps for JMRI</h1>

      <p>Some JMRI users have implemented sophiticated capabilities using the JMRI jython scripting facilities. These are much more than the
      relatively simple examples presented on <a href="Examples.shtml">the Scripting Examples</a> page.  The developers have provided more 
      documentation for these "apps" (available in the <a href="../../scripthelp">"scripthelp" directory.</a>  In fact, the distinguishing feature 
      of apps listed here versus examples listed on the Examples page is that the developers have provided that additional documentation!
      </p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../scripthelp/yaat/YAAT.shtml">YAAT (Yet Another Auto Train)</a></p>

      <p>YetAnotherAutoTrain.py (YAAT) provides the ability to define train actions using text files instead of writing Jython code.  
      The text files contain English like phrases, such as "Set speed to .5" or "Wait for 10 seconds".
      </p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../scripthelp/DispatcherSystem/DispatcherSystem.shtml">Dispatcher System</a></p>

      <p>The Dispatcher System extends <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">JMRI DispatcherPro</a>
      to make it easier to run trains between locations of your choosing. It uses your panel that has signal logic and sections to generate
      another panel that you can use to drive trains by pressing the created "Move To" buttons.  Additional features include 
      stopping and fast mode, and station announcements.
