      <h1>JMRI: Jython Apps for JMRI</h1>

      <p>Some JMRI users have implemented sophiticated capabilities using the JMRI jython scripting facilities. These are much more than the
      relatively simple examples presented on <a href="Examples.shtml">the Scripting Examples</a> page.  The developers have provided more 
      documentation for these "apps" (available in the <a href="../../scripthelp">"scripthelp" directory.</a>  In fact, the distinguishing feature 
      of apps listed here versus examples listed on the Examples page is that the developers have provided that additional documentation!
      </p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../scripthelp/yaat/YAAT.shtml">YAAT (Yet Another Auto Train)</a></p>

      <p>YetAnotherAutoTrain.py (YAAT) provides the ability to define train actions using text files instead of writing a lot of Jython code.  
      The text files contain English like phrases, such as "Set speed to .5" or "Wait for 10 seconds".
      </p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../scripthelp/DispatcherSystem/DispatcherSystem.shtml">Dispatcher System</a></p>

      <p>This program uses a panel that  has signal logic and sections to generate another panel with "Move To" buttons and memory icons so that 
      one can drive trains under <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a> by pressing the Move To buttons
      from any station to any other.  Additional features include stopping and fast mode and station announcements.
