      <h1>JMRI: Jython Apps for JMRI</h1>

      <p>Some JMRI users have implemented sophiticated capabilities using the JMRI jython scripting
      facilities. These are much more than the relatively simple examples presented on <a href=
      "Examples.shtml">the Scripting Examples</a> page. The developers have provided more
      documentation for these "apps" (available in the <a href="../../scripthelp">"scripthelp"
      directory.</a> In fact, the distinguishing feature of apps listed here versus examples listed
      on the Examples page is that the developers have provided that additional documentation!</p>

      <p><a href="../../scripthelp/yaat/YAAT.shtml">YAAT (Yet Another Auto Train)</a>
      </p>

      <p>YetAnotherAutoTrain.py (YAAT) provides the ability to define train actions using text
      files instead of writing Jython code. The text files contain English like phrases, such as
      "Set speed to .5" or "Wait for 10 seconds".</p>

      <p><a href="../../scripthelp/DispatcherSystem/DispatcherSystem.shtml">Dispatcher System</a>
      </p>

      <p>The Dispatcher System extends <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">JMRI DispatcherPro</a> to make it
      easier to run trains between locations of your choosing. It uses your panel that has signal
      logic and sections to generate another panel that you can use to drive trains by pressing the
      created "Move To" buttons. Additional features include stopping and fast mode, and station
      announcements.</p>
