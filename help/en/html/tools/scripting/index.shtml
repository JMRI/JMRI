      <h2>JMRI: Scripting</h2>

      <div class="noted">
        <span class="since">since 4.23.3</span>
        <p>Note: The PanelPro main menu has changed. The four scripting related menu items
        have moved from the <strong>Panels</strong> menu item to the new <strong>Scripting</strong>
        menu item. The menu references in the scripting related documents show the new menu path
        with the old value in braces.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Writing and executing a "script" (program in Python/Jython or other language - see below)
      is a way of telling JMRI to execute commands specific to your JMRI environment and to
      partially or even fully automate your layout and train operations. Scripts can be as simple
      as telling JMRI to set a single sensor or as complex as setting up multiple objects and
      running multiple trains based on feedback from your layout. While there is no comprehensive
      JMRI scripting manual, the examples provided in the pages linked below will be a primary
      source of information on how to use scripting to great advantage with JMRI. The "How To" and
      "What-Where" sections also provide many ideas and hints gleaned from the JMRI community on
      scripting features and capabilities.</p>

      target="_blank">Java Scripting API</a> (commonly refered to JSR-223) compliant scripting
      language can be added to JMRI, however, only Python (Jython) is directly
      supported in the default installation. If you want to add another scripting language, find a
      JSR-223 compliant interpreter and add it to the JMRI classpath as <a href=

      system</a> (different operating systems have different launchers that are configured
