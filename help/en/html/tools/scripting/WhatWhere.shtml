      <p>You CAN use any location for your own
      scripts, including locations within a Dropbox (or other file
      sharing system) folder where they will be available across multiple computers. [Instructions on using
      Dropbox with various JMRI files can be found at <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/Dropbox.shtml" target="_blank">
      JMRI Setup: Sharing Files with Dropbox</a>.]</p>
      
      <p>However, you should NEVER store your own scripts (or any other user-created files) anywhere within your
      Program Location as they will be lost in a JMRI upgrade. Unfortunately, JMRI currently defaults the
      Scripts Location to the Jython sample scripts folder located within your JMRI Program
      Location. To resolve this, change the Scripts Location in Preferences (Preferences->Locations)
      so that your location will be displayed automatically.</p>

      <p>Click for more information on <a href="../../../../../help/en/html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml"> Names and Naming</a>.</p>
		
		<p>System names for sensors, turnouts, lights and others, are connection specific. A LocoNet sensor
		name begins with "LS" while a CMRI sensor begins with "CS" and an internal sensor with "IS". 
		"provide" methods check the prefix of the passed string to determine if it matches a defined connection
		or internal. If so, and the rest of the name is valid, the sensor is created. If a match does not 
		exist, it assigns the prefix for the first connection in the currently open connection list.</p>
		
		<p>Example: If your connections are LocoNet and CMRI, a provideSensor request without a prefix of LS, 
		CS or IS, will be assigned LS. If the name value is not one to four numeric digits (a LocoNet 
		requirement), you get a bad format error. Memories are only internal, so provideMemory uses "IM" as 
		the default prefix.</p>
        
        <p>Since System names follow a prescribed format, there is a procedure for checking whether a name
        is valid.  Use this code to create a sensor with a valid name:</p>
        
        <!-- Example adapted from Randall Wood post to jmriusers@groups.io 2019-09-06 -->
        <pre>
        try:
           sensors.validateSystemNameFormat(MySensorSystemName)
        except jmri.NamedBean.BadSystemNameException:
           print 'Invalid name: ', MySensorSystemName 
        </pre>    
		
		<p>User names are set after input and outputs are created. They can be any character string you want. 
		You can use user name or system name in scripts and Logix. The use of user names is recommended for 
		these purposes if there is the possibility that you will be changing your control system in which case 
		system names will be changing as well.</p>

      <div class="para">
        They're part of the jython language used for the scripting.

        <p>"import" allow you to refer to things by shorter
        names, essentially telling jython "search the imported packages (e.g. jarray and jmri)
        packages and recognize all the names there". For somebody
        trying to understand this script, you can just treat them
        as "ensuring the program can find parts we want".</p>

        <p>"class" means "start the definition of a group of things
        that go together" (all you other experts, please don't jump
        on me about this; I understand both intrinsic/extrinsic
        polymorphism, I'm just trying to get the general idea
        across).</p>

        <p>For example, in the SigletExample.py file is a
        description of a "class" called SigletExample, which
        contains two routines/functions/members: A subroutine
        called "defineIO", and one called "setOutput"</p>

        <p>This "class" is associated with another called "Siglet"
        (actually jmri.jmrit.automat.Siglet; that's that long
        naming thing again), which knows when to invoke routines by
        those two names to get done what you want.</p>

        <p>Essentially, you're defining two parts ("defineIO" &amp;
        "setOutput") that plug into a pre-existing structure to
        drive signals. That pre-existing structure is very
        powerful, and lets you do all sorts of things, but also
        provides this method to try to keep it simpler.</p>

        <p>OK, at this point most people's eyes are fully glazed
        over. Your best bet when starting with this stuff is to use
        the "copy and modify" approach to software development.
        It's good to try to understand the entire content of the
        file, but don't worry about understanding it well enough to
        be able to recreate it from scratch. Instead, just modify
        little bits and play with it.</p>

 	  <!-- Section created by Jerry Grochow 2019-10-14 based on post to jmriusers@groups.io by Bob Jacobson 2018-11-01 -->

      
      <div class="para">
      
      <p>Scripts are part of the main JMRI program. This creates a bit of a problem:  when something goes wrong
      in a script, it may crash JMRI.  When a script goes to sleep, the whole program sleeps. However, if you want
      to run independent of JMRI, you can via a separate "thread."  The Siglet and AbstractAutomaton classes have
      created to allow you to base your scripts on a class that will run as an independent thread but with the 
      ability to communicate with the rest of JMRI.  For more information, see 
      <a href="../../../../../help/en/html/doc/Technical/Threads.shtml">the section on threads.</a></p>      
      
      <p>Effectively, each Automat or Siglet is a separate program running when it needs to.  Since they run in 
      separate threads, they can wait for something to happen while the rest of the JMRI program proceeds - a
      very useful capability indeed. </p>

	  <h2><a id="siglet-automaton">What's the difference between the "Siglet" and
      "AbstractAutomaton" classes?</a></h2>

      <div class="para">
 
        <p>Some examples use the <a href=
        "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/AbstractAutomaton.html" target="_blank">
        AbstractAutomaton</a> class as a base, while others use the
        <a href=
        "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/Siglet.html" target="_blank">
        Siglet</a> class. This is because those are intended for
        two different purposes.</p>

        <p>"Siglet" is meant to be used for driving signals. You
        provide two pieces of code:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt><b>defineIO</b></dt>

          <dd>which defines the various sensors, turnouts and
          signals that the output signal depends on as input when
          calculating the appearance of the signal.</dd>

          <dt><b>setOutout</b></dt>

          <dd>which recalculates the signal appearance from the
          defined inputs.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>The Siglet base class then handles all of the listening
        for changes, setting up for parallel execution, etc. Your
        defineIO routine will be called once at the beginning, and
        after than any time one or more of the inputs changes, your
        setOutput routine will be called to recalculate the signal
        appearance.</p>

        <p>Of course, you can use this class to calculate other
        things than signal appearances. But the key element is that
        the calculation is redone when the inputs change, and only
        when the inputs change.</p>

        <p>AbstractAutomaton is a more general class that's
        intended to allow more powerful operations (and Siglet
        actually uses that more powerful base). You define two
        functions:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt><b>init</b></dt>

          <dd>which is called exactly once to do any one-time setup
          you need</dd>

          <dt><b>handle</b></dt>

          <dd>which is called over and over and over again until it
          returns FALSE.</dd>
        </dl>Using AbstractAutomoton provides you with a number of
        tools: you can wait for a particular sensor to go active,
        do something, then wait for a different sensor to go
        inactive, etc. This allows you much more freedom to create
        complicated and powerful sequences than the Siglet class,
        because Siglets are limited to doing just one thing (they
        aren't intended to do sequences of operations).

        <p>For more info on the routines that AbstractAutomaton
        provides to help you, see the <a href=
        "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/AbstractAutomaton.html#method_summary" target="_blank">

        called "Method Summary")</p>
