	  <p>The easiest way to learn how to use scripts in JMRI is to study the simplest examples first
      and work your way into more complex details. The sections below discuss various aspects of scripting
      that will help you to understand the more complex scripts found in the <a href="Examples.shtml" target="_blank">
      JMRI examples library</a> included in the distribution and online:</p>

	  <h4>CAUTION: Python and its Jython variant do not use braces, brackets, or parentheses to
	  indicate program structure, but rather rely on formatting, specifically indentation.  To avoid 
	  confusion, it is STRONGLY recommended that you DO NOT USE TABS but rather use spaces (four is typical)
	  to show statements that part of a class or controlled structure where you might have used some bracketing.
	  Most program editors have a setting to automatically changes tabs to a set number of spaces to make this easier.</h4>
	  
      <h2><a id="helloworld" name="helloworld">Running "Hello World"</a></h2>
      
      <div class="para">
      
      There are several ways to use
      Python scripts with JMRI. The easiest is to use the built-in
      support in the standard JMRI applications: PanelPro,
      DecoderPro, etc.<br>
      To do that:

      <ul>
        <li><a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/jmriScriptWindow.png">
        <img src=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/jmriScriptWindow.png"
        width="250" height="136" align="right" alt="JMRI Jython Script Window"></a>From the
        "Panels" menu, select "Script Entry". This will give you a
        window where you can type one or more commands to execute.
        (Note that it might take a little while the first time you
        do this as the program finds its libraries; it will be
        faster the next time) The commands stay in the window, so
        you can edit them and rerun them until you like them.</li>

        <li>From the "Panels" menu, select "Script Output". This
        creates a window that shows the output from the script
        commands you issue.</li>

        <li>To see this in operation, type
          <pre  style="font-family: monospace;">
        print "Hello World"
        
</pre>in the input window, and click "Execute". You should see the
output in the Script Output window immediately:
          <pre  style="font-family: monospace;">
        &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Hello World"
        Hello World
        
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Python also evaluates expressions, etc. Remove the
        contents of the input window (select it and hit delete),
        and enter
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        print 1+2
        
</pre>then click execute. The output window should then show
something like:
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        &gt;&gt;&gt; print 1+2
        3
        
</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!--Section added by Jerry Grochow 2018-10-18 based on comments found in the JMRI Users online forum from 
      Cliff in BajaSoCal and Bob Jacobson-->
      
      <div class="para">
      <p>JMRI does not provide a full "development environment," but it does provide some basic information
      that can help with debugging your scripts.</p>  
      
      <p>Open the JMRI System Console window (Help->System Console).
      This will give you instant information pertaining to WARN and ERROR messages. Text can be copied to a
      text editor for further review.</p>
      
      <p>Open the Script Output window (Panels->Script Output).  This will display the results of any
      "print" statements in your script as well as some error messages (NOTE that some errors go here and
      some to the System Console so you you should have both windows open when you are debugging).
       Text can be copied to a text editor for further review.

      <p>Investigate the information found in the  
      <a href="../../doc/Technical/Logging.shtml" target="_blank">technical reference</a>
      to be better able to insert more of your own DEBUG and INFO messages into the session.log file, 
      and also the JMRI System Console window.  You might also investigate the "default.lcf" file that is
      described in that link.</p>
      
      <p>Note to Mac OS users: BBEdit and similar tools do some syntax checking. For PC users, Notepad++
      is a good tool for getting indentation correct.</p>

     <pre style="font-family: monospace;">

&gt;&gt;&gt; lt1 = turnouts.provideTurnout("1")

&gt;&gt;&gt; lt1.setCommandedState(CLOSED)

&gt;&gt;&gt; print lt1.commandedState

&gt;&gt;&gt; lt1.commandedState = THROWN

&gt;&gt;&gt; print lt1.commandedState

&gt;&gt;&gt; turnouts.provideTurnout("1").getCommandedState()
1
    </pre>

      <p>Note that this is running a complete version of the JMRI
      application; all of the windows and menus are presented the same
      way, configuration is done by the preferences panel, etc. What the
      Jython connection adds is a command line from which you can
      directly manipulate things.

      <p>This also shows some of the simplifications that Jython
      and the Python language brings to using JMRI code. The Java
      member function:</p>
      
    <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        turnout.SetCommandedState(jmri.Turnout.CLOSED);
    </pre>
      
      can also be expressed in Jython as:
      
     <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
        turnout.commandedState = CLOSED
    </pre>

      <p>This results in much easier-to-read code.</p>

      <p>There are a lot of useful Python books and online
      tutorials. For more information on the Jython language and
      it's relations with Java, the best reference is the <a href=
      "http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jythoness/" target="_blank">Jython
      Essentials</a> book published by O'Reilly. The <a href=
      "https://www.jython.org/" target="_blank">jython.org web site</a> is also very
      useful.</p>

      <h2><a id="objects" name="objects">Access to JMRI Objects</a></h2>
	  
      <div class="para">
      
      JMRI uses the factory-pattern
      extensively to get access to objects. In Java this results in
      verbose code like
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   Turnout t2 = InstanceManager.getDefault(TurnoutManager.class).newTurnout("LT2", "turnout 2");
   t2.SetCommandedState(Turnout.THROWN)
</pre>Jython simplifies that by allowing us to provide useful
variables, and by shortening certain method calls.

      <p>To get easier access to the SignalHead, Sensor and Turnout
      managers and the CommandStation object, several shortcut
      variables are defined:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>sensors</li>

        <li>turnouts</li>

        <li>lights</li>

        <li>signals (SignalHeads)</li>

        <li>masts (SignalMasts)</li>

        <li>routes</li>

        <li>blocks</li>

        <li>reporters</li>

        <li>memories</li>

        <li>powermanager</li>

        <li>addressedProgrammers</li>
        <li>globalProgrammers</li>

        <li>dcc (current command station)</li>

        <li>audio</li>

        <li>shutdown (current shutdown manager)</li>
        
        <li>layoutblocks</li>

        <li>warrants</li>

      </ul>These can then be referenced directly in Jython as
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">t2 = turnouts.provideTurnout("12");
</pre>Note that the variable t2 did not need to be declared.

      <p>Jython provides a shortcut for parameters that have been
      defined with Java-Bean-like get and set methods:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    t2.SetCommandedState(Turnout.THROWN)
</pre>can be written as
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    t2.commandedState = THROWN
</pre>

<p>where the assignment is actually invoking the set method.</p>
        
    <p>Also note that THROWN was defined when running the Python script at
        startup;<br> CLOSED, ACTIVE, INACTIVE, RED, YELLOW and GREEN are also
    defined. ( <a 
    href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/script/JmriScriptEngineManager.java">These 
        shortcut bindings are defined in Java</a> )
    </p>
      <p>A similar mechanism can be used to check the state of
      something:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sensors.provideSensor("3").knownState == ACTIVE
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sensors.provideSensor("3").knownState == INACTIVE
0
</pre>Note that Jython uses "1" to indicate true, and "0" to
indicate false, so sensor 3 is currently active in this example.
You can also use the symbols "True" and "False" respectively.

      <p>You can directly invoke more complicated methods, e.g. to
      send a DCC packet to the rails you type:</p>
      <pre  style="font-family: monospace;">
   
    dcc.sendPacket([0x01, 0x03, 0xbb], 4)
</pre>This sends that three-byte packet four times, and then
returns to the command line.

      <p>[See also <a href="HowTo.shtml" target="_blank">the scripting "How To" page</a> for more information
      on these topics.]</p>
      
      <p>Scripting would
      not be very interesting if you had to type the commands each
      time. So you can put scripts in a text file and execute them
      by selecting the "Run Script..." menu item, or by using the
      "Advanced Preferences" to run the script file when the
      program starts.</p>

      <p>Although the statements we showed above were so fast you
      couldn't see it, the rest of the program was waiting while
      you run these samples. This is not a problem for a couple
      statements, or for a script file that just does a bunch of
      things (perhaps setting a couple turnouts, etc) and quits.
      But you might want things to happen over a longer period, or
      perhaps even wait until something happens on the layout
      before some part of your script runs. For example, you might
      want to reverse a locomotive when some sensor indicates it's
      reached the end of the track.</p>

      <p>There are a couple of ways to do this. First, your script
      could define a "listener", and attach it to a particular
      sensor, turnout, etc. A listener is a small subroutine which
      gets called when whatever it's attached to has it's state
      change. For example, a listener subroutine attached to a
      particular turnout gets called when the turnout goes from
      thrown to closed, or from closed to thrown. The subroutine
      can then look around, decide what to do, and execute the
      necessary commands. When the subroutine returns, the rest of
      the program then continues until the listened-to object has
      it's state change again, when the process repeats.</p>

      <p>For more complicated things, where you really want your
      script code to be free-running within the program, you define
      a "class" that does what you want. In short form, this gives
      you a way to have independent code to run inside the program.
      But don't worry about this until you've got some more
      experience with scripting.</p>
