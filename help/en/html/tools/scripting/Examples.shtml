      <h1>JMRI: Scripting Examples</h1>

      <p>The JMRI distributions come with a jython directory that
      contains a few example scripts. This page provides a short
      description of each, copied from the comment in the scripts
      themselves.</p>

      <p>To run one of these scripts, start DecoderPro or PanelPro (set
      preferences to "LocoNet Simulator" to run without connecting
      to a layout), then under the Panels manu, select Run Script.
      Find and select the desired script file in the "jython" folder of
      the JMRI program directory and click the Run button.</p>

      <p>To browse the most current set of scripts, please see the
      <a href="http://jmri.org/jython">jython directory</a> on the
      JMRI web site.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/AD4OnOff.py">AD4OnOff.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script to show put a button on the screen that will
      enable or disable local control of AD4 accessory decoders.<br>
      This script has been superseded by the "Lock" capability in
      JMRI 1.9.3 and later. You can directly request that JMRI
      lock/unlock a Turnout via the Turnout Table, Routes and
      Logix.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/AddButton.py">AddButton.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script to add a button to the main JMRI application
      window that loads a script file</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/AddButton.py">AlarmClock.py</a></p>

      <p>This is an example script to pulse an output based on a
      Fast Clock.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/AppleScript.py">AppleScript.py</a></p>

      <p>This is an example script for invoking an AppleScript from
      JMRI on Mac OS X.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/AutoActiveTrains_Simulator.py">AutoActiveTrains_Simulator.py</a>
      </p>

      <p>Simulator for <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a>
      AutoActiveTrains.
      While auto train(s) are "moving", repeatedly activates "next" allocated block,
      and deactivate "last" occupied Block. Waits for debounce time plus a bit to
      allow signals, etc. to respond.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/AutoDispatcher2.py">AutoDispatcher2.py</a></p>

      <p>This script provides full layout automation, using connectivity info
      provided by Layout Editor panels.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/AutoLayoutPowerOff.py">AutoLayoutPowerOff.py</a></p>

      <p>This script turns off power to the layout automatically
      after there has been no activity on the layout for a
      specified amount of time. (Activity is detected by monitoring
      block occupancy detectors.) It is intended to be run from the
      Start-up Preferences.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/AutomatonExample.py">AutomatonExample.py</a></p>

      <p>This is an example script for a JMRI "Automat" in Python.
      It listens to two sensors, running a locomotive back and
      forth between them by changing its direction when a sensor
      detects the engine. You need to set the speed of the engine
      using a throttle.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/BackAndForth.py">BackAndForth.py</a></p>

      <p>This is an example script for a JMRI "Automat" in Python.
      It is based on the AutomatonExample. It listens to two
      sensors, running a locomotive back and forth between them by
      changing its direction when a Sensor detects the engine.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/BackAndForthTimed.py">BackAndForthTimed.py</a></p>

      <p>This is an example script for a JMRI "Automat" in Python.
      It is based on the AutomatonExample. It runs a locomotive
      back and forth using time delays.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/CanExample.py">CanExample.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script to show how to send and receive CAN
      Frames.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/ControlPanel.py">ControlPanel.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script to show a set of JButtons that show/hide
      panel windows when clicked.<br>
      When this script is run, it finds all open Panels (either
      Panel Editor or Layout Editor) and creates a small
      window with a button for each. The buttons are labeled
      with the names of the Panels, and it's required that those
      names be unique.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/DebounceSensor.py">DebounceSensor.py</a></p>

      <p>This script manages an internal Sensor as a debounced
      version of another Sensor. Both the On and Off delays may be
      specified.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/DecoderPro.py">DecoderPro.py</a></p>

      <p>Python code to start a DecoderPro app, complete with menu
      bar</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/DisableOpsMode.py">DisableOpsMode.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script to navigate through the GUI and disable the
      Ops Mode button on the main DecoderPro window.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/InitTurnouts.py">InitTurnouts.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script showing how to initialize turnouts based on
      the state of their input sensors (e.g. feedback)<br>
      This is particularly useful for a C/MRI system, where the
      turnouts need to be set to a particular state quickly.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/JButtonComplexExample.py">JButtonComplexExample.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script to show a JFrame for data entry. The frame
      contains two JTextFields, and a button which is inactive
      until data has been entered. Once activated, the button
      prints a little diagnostic message when clicked. The print
      statement can be changed to include whatever desired, e.g.
      throw a turnout, program a CV, etc.<br>
      This script creates a panel called "Data entry" with two
      fields that data is to be entered in. The script waits for
      something in both fields to be entered and then enables
      the "Enter values" button. When "Enter values" button is clicked,
      it causes the data to be displayed on the Java console and the
      "Data entry" panel to disappear. To see the output on the
      Java console you need to open the Java console or select
      "Script Output" from the JMRI "Panels" menu.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/JButtonExample.py">JButtonExample.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script to show a JButton which prints a little
      message when clicked. The print statement can be changed to
      include whatever desired, e.g. throw a turnout, program a CV,
      etc.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/jmri_defaults.py">jmri_defaults.py</a></p>

      <p>Python code to define common JMRI defaults. Assumes JMRI
      has already been initialized, so this can reference various
      managers, etc. This is only read once, when the JMRI library
      first executes a script, so changes will not take effect
      until after restarting the program.</p>

      <p><a href=
            "../../../../../jython/PanelPro.py">PanelPro.py</a></p>

      <p>Python code to start a PanelPro app, complete with menu
      bar. (probably obsolete at this point, the usual method now is
      to start DecoderPro or PanelPro and then run Python scripts
      from within it; left as an example of the approach)</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/ListenerExample.py">ListenerExample.py</a></p>

      <p>Example of an event listener for a JMRI class, in this
      case a Turnout.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/LnPowerButton.py">LnPowerButton.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script to show a JButton which sends a LocoNet
      message when clicked. In this case, the LocoNet message
      alternates between "On" and "Off" for a PM4 relay. The
      particular relay is addressed by the board and zone variables
      set in the code. Note that the message sent to the PM4
      has fixed contents for the other three (of four) channels on
      the card. Will this cause a problem in normal operation?</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/LnSendTool.py">LnSendTool.py</a></p>

      <p>This script will send several of the most command LocoNet
      type messages. These include switch, feedback and sensor type
      messages. DCC signal packets can also be sent via LocoNet.
      Messages are configured using radio buttons and combo
      boxes. Portions of this script are taken from
      LnPowerButton.py by Bob Jacobsen.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/LocoTest.py">LocoTest.py</a></p>

      <p>Script to test a locomotive and decoder after
      installation. It pops a pane for entering the locomotive
      address, and a "Go" button. Upon clicking the button, it
      sequences through a series of operations: F0 on, F0 off, F1
      on, F1 off.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/MemorySiglet.py">MemorySiglet.py</a></p>

      <p>This is an example script for a JMRI "Siglet" in Python. It
      listens to a Memory object, and prints the new state to
      stdout.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/NSelectorExample.py">NSelectorExample.py</a></p>

      <p>This is an example script for putting an "N-way" selector
      on a Panel. The panel contains N Sensor icons (in this example
      numbered 101, 102, 103). When one is clicked on the panel,
      the others Sensors are forced to Inactive and the program sets
      outputs appropriately (in this case setting Turnouts 101 and
      102). For N large, this would be better done with arrays and
      closures, but for N = 3 a direct approach is better.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/NumberInput.py">NumberInput.py</a></p>

      <p>Fill a memory with a two-digit number, using 10 Sensors as
      digit inputs.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/OpsProgExample.py">OpsProgExample.py</a></p>

      <p>This sample Automaton watches a Sensor, and adjusts the
      momentum of a locomotive using ops-mode programming when the
      Sensor state changes. The Sensor and decoder address are hardcoded,
      as this is an example of just the Automaton function. Adding
      a GUI to configure these would be straight-forward. The
      values could be passed via the constructor, or the
      constructor (which can run in any required thread) could
      invoke a dialog.</p>

      <p><a href=
            "../../../../../jython/ParallelPortTest.py">ParallelPortTest.py</a></p>

      <p>Try to send some bytes to a parallel port.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/ParallelPortTurnouts.py">ParallelPortTurnouts.py</a></p>

      <p>Connect JMRI Turnouts to parallel port logic. Maps internal
      Turnouts to specific values to be send to the parallel port.
      Note that JMRI must be set up to have a valid turnout table;
      if you're not using some other DCC connection, configure JMRI
      to use LocoNet Simulator.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/PM4Announce.py">PM4Announce.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script to make an announcement when a PM4 section
      changes state. This assumes that the PM4 sections are doing
      short protection. If they are doing auto-reversing, you might
      want to change the announcement message in the script. Also, it
      assumes that only one PM4 is going to trip at a time.<br>
      Note that the previous state (oldStateN variables) is not kept
      per-board, but just as one single copy. If you want to track
      changes in multiple boards, this needs to become a more
      complicated data structure that's e.g. indexed by board.<br>
      Also note that if multiple sections change at once and you're
      using the "speak" command, the announcements may overlap.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/PocketTesterExample.py">PocketTesterExample.py</a></p>

      <p>Example of an event listener for a PRICOM PocketTester.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/PowerSensor.py">PowerSensor.py</a></p>

      <p>Provides an example of listening to the PowerManager, and
      operating a Sensor to indicate changes. The Sensor address
      used to indicate the power status is hardcoded as
      "100". Change this if you want to use some other sensor.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/RailDriver.py">RailDriver.py</a></p>

      <p>Connect a RailDriver Modern Desktop (USB device) to a
      throttle.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/ReporterFontControl.py">ReporterFontControl.py</a></p>

      <p>Script to go through each open Panel, walk down the object
      hierarchy and search for all ReporterIcon objects. Every
      ReporterIcon will have its font size and color set as
      specified at the top of the script. In addition to being a
      useful tool in itself, this is a good example of stepping
      through the object structure of a Panel.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/ReporterFormatter.py">ReporterFormatter.py</a></p>

      <p>Provides an example of listening to a Reporter, and
      putting the changes to a Memory in a nicer format. The
      Reporter and Memory names are hardcoded in the example near
      the bottom. Change those to something that makes sense for
      your layout. First, define the listener class. This gets
      messages from the Reporter, uses them to keep track of the
      decoders in a Block, and writes that list to a Memory for
      display.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/RobotThrottle.py">RobotThrottle.py</a></p>

      <p>This script runs a loco around the track, controlling the
      speed according to signals and following the Blocks.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/RosterLoop.py">RosterLoop.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script showing how to loop through the Roster
      entries. This example just prints the name, but you can
      extract or use other info too.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/RpsRaceTrack.py">RpsRaceTrack.py</a></p>

      <p>RaceTrack using RPS position measurement; loco1 is faster,
      loco2 is slower. When loco1 comes within dmin=24 inches of
      loco2, it will: slow to 1/4 of its speed, wait 6 seconds,
      return to its original speed and check again. This is
      time-based (checks every 200 msec), rather than measurement
      based (listeners) for ease of debugging. Changing it over
      later on will be good.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/SampleLnStats.py">SampleLnStats.py</a></p>

      <p>This is script for samples the LocoNet statistics once per
      minute and prints them out.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/SampleSound.py">SampleSound.py</a></p>

      <p>This is an example script for playing a sound in a JMRI
      script.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/SensorLog.py">SensorLog.py</a></p>

      <p>Listen to all Sensors, printing a line when they change
      state.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/Sensor-sound.py">Sensor-sound.py</a></p>

      <p>Listens for specific Sensor (Sensor #4), plays crossing
      gate sound on train entering Block.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/SetTurnouts.py">SetTurnouts.py</a></p>

      <p>Sample script showing how to set multiple turnouts to specific
      positions, with a time delay between them, separately from
      other things that the program is doing. By putting the
      turnout commands in a separate class, they'll run
      independently after the "start" operation.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/ShutDownExample.py">ShutDownExample.py</a></p>

      <p>Schedule something to happen when a JMRI application
      ends.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/SigletExample.py">SigletExample.py</a></p>

      <p>This is an example script for a JMRI "Siglet" in Python. It
      listens for changes to two Sensors and a Turnout, and then
      recalculates a Signal Mast Aspect based on the values.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/ThrottleSound.py">ThrottleSound.py</a></p>

      <p>Play a sound when the F3 key is pressed on the handheld
      and loco 1001 selected.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/TurnoutReset.py">TurnoutReset.py</a></p>

      <p>Reset a Turnout to Closed every time it's clicked Thrown
      This might be used so that a Turnout icon on a panel sits in
      one position, ready to be clicked and fire a Route. The top of
      the file defines the needed code. There are some lines near
      the bottom you should edit to adapt it to your particular
      layout.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/TwoOutputTurnouts.py">TwoOutputTurnouts.py</a></p>

      <p>Drive a turnout from two C/MRI outputs. Some C/MRI
      users connect slow-motion switch machines between two C/MRI
      outputs, and then set the outputs to complementary states
      (one active, one inactive) to drive the machine in the two
      directions. This script slaves a 2nd turnout to a first one,
      so that when the first one is commanded to a particular
      state, the second one goes to the other state. To use this,
      edit the script to include your Turnouts at the bottom (see
      the existing example; you should remove that). Then select this
      file as a script to be run at startup from the "Advanced
      Preferences" on the Preferences Start Up pane.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../../jython/USBThrottle.py">USBThrottle.py</a></p>

      <p><a>Use a USB device as a throttle</a></p>

      <p><a href="../../../../../jython/javaone">javaone</a></p>

      <p>The jython/javaone directory contains scripts that were
      first created for the JavaOne test layout.</p>
