      <h1>JMRI: LRoute Documentation</h1>

      <h2>What are LRoutes?</h2>

      <p>LRoutes extend the capabilities of Routes. Lights and
      Signal Heads are included in the collection of Turnouts
      and/or Sensors whose states may be set all at once and used
      for control of the LRoute. As with Routes, when an LRoute is
      triggered a sound may be played, or a script may be run.
      LRoutes are capable of performing all of the tasks that
      Routes can do. For further discussion and examples consult
      the main <a href="Routes.shtml">Route documentation</a>.</p>

      <h2>How LRoutes differ from Routes?</h2>

      <p>Whereas a Route may be controlled by up to three sensors
      and/or by a control turnout, an LRoute may use any number or
      combination of Sensors, Turnouts, Lights, and/or Signal Heads
      to control the "route".</p>

      <p>LRoutes are implemented as a group of Conditionals in a
      Logix. This provides another extension of capabilities in
      that, this Logix may be edited in the Logix Editor where
      Conditionals can be edited or created to preform other tasks.
      When a LRoute is created, or when it is read from a
      configuration file, the LRoute is 'activated'; it is set up
      to monitor automatically any changes in state of its control
      entities. When these entities change in the user-specified
      way, the LRoute is 'set' ('triggered') and the actions
      selected by the user are taken - And if specified, a sound is
      played or a script is run.</p>

      <p>The LRoute Table contains an 'Enabled' column. For an
      LRoute to be triggered by its control entities, it must be
      "enabled". That is, its check box in the 'Enabled' column
      must be checked. This check box enables/disables the Logix
      implementing the LRoute.</p>

      <h2>How to set up for adding or editing LRoutes</h2>

      <p>First make sure the Tables for Sensors, Turnouts, Lights
      and/or SignalHeads contain all the entities involved in the
      LRoutes to be defined. Next select
      <b><a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LRouteTable.shtml">LRoute Table</a></b>
      from the <b>Tools</b> menu.</p>

      <a name="addroute" id="addroute"></a>
      <h3>To add a new LRoute:</h3>

      <p>Click the
      <b><a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LRouteAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a></b>
      button at the bottom of the pane to bring up the Add LRoute
      pane.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Enter a system name, such as 'RTX100'. Any short name
          can be used provided it is different from the system name
          of other LRoutes.</p>

          <p>By convention, system names usually start with "RTX"
          for an LRoute.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter a user name. Any string of characters that is
          different from the user name of other LRoutes will be
          accepted, but it's wise to use a string that describes
          the intended use of the LRoute.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Note the four tabs beneath the menu bar. Select the tab
        labeled <b>Actions (output)</b>. This displays a table with
        all of the Sensors, Turnouts, Lights, and/or SignalHeads
        that the user has defined in their respective tables.</li>

        <li>
          <p>Select the entities to be included for actions to be
          taken in the LRoute from the list by clicking on the
          checkbox in the <b>Include</b> column. For each included
          item, use the combo box in the <b>Set Action</b> column
          to select the action that should be taken for the
          entity. For example, an included turnout is to be 'Set
          Closed', 'Set Thrown' or 'Toggle'd and an included sensor
          is to be 'Set Active', 'Set Inactive' or 'Toggle'd when
          the LRoute is 'Set' - similarly for lights. An included
          SignalHead can be set to any one of its 'appearances'.
          Don't worry if everything isn't perfect. It's easy to
          edit this information later.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Note that the 'Actions (output)' Tab allows you to
          display 'All' the entities or just the 'Included' ones.
          This is only for your convenience in checking that all
          desired entities have been included; it does not affect
          entered information.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Next select the tab labeled <b>Triggers/Controls
          (input)</b>. This also displays a table with all the
          Sensors, Turnouts, Lights and/or SignalHeads that the
          user has defined in their respective tables.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select the entities to be included to control (i.e.
          trigger) the LRoute from the list by clicking on the
          checkbox in the <b>Include</b> column. For each included
          item, use the combo box in the <b>Trigger State</b>
          column to select the state that should be taken to
          trigger the entity. For example, an included turnout may
          be set to trigger 'On Closed', 'On Thrown' or On Change'.
          It will prevent triggering when thrown if 'Veto When
          Thrown' is selected or prevent triggering when closed if
          'Veto When Closed' is selected. The selections are
          similar for an included Sensor or Light. An included
          SignalHead has the choices for "On" for each of its
          appearances and choices for "Veto When" for each
          appearance.</p>
        </li>

        <li>This tab also has 'All' and 'include' radio buttons
        that operate in a similar manner as the previous tab.</li>

        <li>
          <p>Next select the tab labeled
          <b>Alignment/Locks/etc.</b>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you want the LRoute to play a sound when it
          triggers, enter the file name of a sound file in the text
          box following 'Play sound file'. Clicking <b>Set</b> will
          bring up a file selection dialog to help locate the file.
          Once the file is located, clicking on its name in the
          dialog will copy it, complete with path, into the text
          box.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Similarly if you want a script to be run when the
          LRoute triggers, enter its file name into the text box
          labeled 'Run Script'. The <b>Set</b> button can be used
          as above to assist in entering script file
          information.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Checking the check box <b>Set Locks</b> will lock the
          turnouts included from the 'Actions (output)' tab when
          the entities from the 'Triggers/Controls (input)'
          trigger. When these entities are no longer determine a
          trigger state, the above turnouts are unlocked. For more
          information on turnout locks, see <a href=
          "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/RouteAddEdit.shtml#Turnout%20lock%20feature">
          Turnout Lock feature</a> .</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The table on the 'Alignment/Locks/etc.' tab lists all
          the sensors defined in the Sensor Table. A sensor (or
          sensors) may be chosen to go active when the actions of
          the entities included from the 'Actions (output)' tab are
          completed. You may choose to indicate 'alignment' of the
          Sensors, Turnouts, Lights, and/or SignalHeads in separate
          groups or for all them together. If the group actions are
          completed in by means other than the LRoute trigger, the
          sensor will still indicate 'alignment'.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Finally, select the tab labeled <b>LRoute Basics</b>
          to return to the first tab.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of
          the pane. If everything is fine, a message stating "New
          LRoute added ... " will be displayed in the notes box
          near the bottom of the tab. If there is trouble with
          anything, an error message will be displayed in the notes
          box; you should correct the error and click <b>Add
          LRoute</b> again.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>To abort adding the LRoute, press the <b>Cancel</b>
      button.</p>

      <h3>To edit an existing LRoute:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Edit of an existing LRoute may be started in either of
        two ways:

          <ul>
            <li>Click on a LRoute's <b>Edit</b> button in the
            LRoute Table.</li>

            <li>Enter the system name of the LRoute to be edited in
            the Add/Edit LRoute window and click the <b>Edit
            LRoute</b> button at the bottom of the Add/Edit LRoute
            window. This must be the same as the system name shown
            in the LRoute Table.</li>
          </ul>The <b>Add LRoute</b> and <b>Edit LRoute</b> buttons
          in the Add/Edit LRoute window will change to <b>Delete
          LRoute</b>, <b>Update LRoute</b> and <b>Cancel</b>.
        </li>

        <li>Make whatever changes or additions you need to the
        information in the dialog. Note that the system name of the
        edited LRoute may not be changed, but the user name may be
        changed. Other items are as described <a href=
        "#addroute">above</a>.</li>

        <li>After making changes to the LRoute information, click
        <b>Update LRoute</b> to change the selected LRoute. If
        everything is fine, a message stating "LRoute updated ... "
        will be displayed in the notes box near the bottom of the
        window. If there is any trouble, an error message will be
        displayed in the notes box, and the update is stopped for
        you to correct the error and click <b>Update LRoute</b>
        again.</li>

        <li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit edit mode without changing
        the selected LRoute. If the Add/Edit LRoute window is
        dismissed (closed) while in edit mode, <b>Cancel</b> is
        automatically selected, and no changes are made to the
        selected LRoute.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>To delete the LRoute, press the <b>Delete LRoute</b>
      button.</p>

      <h3>LRoute Table controls</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Below the LRoute Table you'll find the
          <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LRouteAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
          button to add new LRoutes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>To save LRoutes to disk:</h3>

      <p>LRoutes are kept in your <i>layout configuration</i>, along
      with turnouts, sensors, signal heads, lights, control
      panel setup etc. To store
      this information on disk, use <b>Store Configuration...</b>
      in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the LRoute Table (or
      other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store
      Panel...</b> in the <b>Panel</b> menu. Note that the
      enabled/disabled state of each LRoute is not saved in the
      configuration file. When LRoutes are loaded from a
      configuration file, they are all enabled.</p>

      <a name="sensorlogic" id="sensorlogic"></a>
      <h3>Controlling LRoutes from Control/Trigger Entities</h3>

      The
      operation of an LRoute can be controlled by many means:
      sensors connected to occupancy detectors or switches on the
      layout, or lights in the case of C/MRI. Even SignalHead
      appearances can control the route. The sensors and turnouts
      can be real or internal entities.

      <p>For example, by default when any one of the included
      sensors goes to the active state, the LRoute will be set.
      This could be used to set a LRoute when a block became
      occupied, or when a button was pushed.</p>

      <p>Each control Sensor has a "mode" associated with it, which
      can be:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>"On Active"</dt>

        <dd>The default method, the LRoute is triggered when the
        sensor goes active, e.g. "Throw turnout 12 when sensor 12
        goes active"</dd>

        <dt>"On Inactive"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the sensor goes inactive.
        For example, using the LRoute above, plus a second LRoute
        "Close turnout 12 when sensor 12 goes inactive" will have
        turnout 12 follow a panel switch connected to sensor 12 as
        it is flipped back and forth.</dd>

        <dt>"On Change"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the sensor state changes,
        either from active to inactive or from inactive to
        active.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Active"</dt>

        <dd>If this sensor is active, the LRoute will not trigger,
        no matter what states the other control entities change to.
        This has several uses, e.g. to prevent throwing a turnout
        under a train when the block shows occupied.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Inactive"</dt>

        <dd>Like veto active, but the other polarity logic.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Similar to the control sensors discussed above, a control
      turnout has a "mode" associated with it, which can be:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>"On Closed"</dt>

        <dd>The default method, the LRoute is triggered when the
        turnout changes to the closed state.</dd>

        <dt>"On Thrown"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the turnout changes to the
        thrown state.</dd>

        <dt>"On Change"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the turnout state changes,
        either from closed to thrown or from thrown to closed.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Closed"</dt>

        <dd>If this turnout is closed, the LRoute is prevented from
        triggering.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Thrown"</dt>

        <dd>If this turnout is thrown, the LRoute is prevented from
        triggering.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Likewise, Light controls have "modes" which can be:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>"On Lit"</dt>

        <dd>The default method, the LRoute is triggered when the
        light changes to the lit state.</dd>

        <dt>"On Not Lit"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the light changes to the
        unlit state.</dd>

        <dt>"On Change"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the light state changes,
        either from lit to unlit or from unlit to lit.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Lit"</dt>

        <dd>If this light is lit, the LRoute is prevented from
        triggering.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Unlit"</dt>

        <dd>If this light is not lit, the LRoute is prevented from
        triggering.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>The SignalHead control "modes" differ somewhat from the
      above. They are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>"On Red"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the signal changes to the
        Red appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"On Red Flashing"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the signal changes to the
        Red Flashing appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"On Yellow "</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the signal changes to the
        Yellow appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"On Yellow Flashing"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the signal changes to the
        Yellow Flashing appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"On Green "</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the signal changes to the
        Green appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"On Green Flashing"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the signal changes to the
        Green Flashing appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"On Lit "</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the signal changes from
        dark to lit.</dd>

        <dt>"On Held "</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the signal set to
        Held.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Red"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is prevented from triggering when the signal
        changes to the Red appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Red Flashing"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is prevented from triggering when the signal
        changes to the Red Flashing appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Yellow "</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is triggered when the signal changes to the
        Yellow appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Yellow Flashing"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is prevented from triggering when the signal
        changes to the Yellow Flashing appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Green "</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is prevented from triggering when the signal
        changes to the Green appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Green Flashing"</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is prevented from triggering when the signal
        changes to the Green Flashing appearance.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Lit "</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is prevented from triggering when the signal
        changes from dark to lit.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto When Held "</dt>

        <dd>The LRoute is prevented from triggering when the signal
        set to Held.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Note that there is an implied "and/or" here. All of the
      'veto' sensors, the 'veto' turnouts, 'veto' lights and 'veto'
      signals must be in their non-veto state and at least one of
      the triggering entities must experience the appropriate
      change for the LRoute to be set. A single 'veto' turnout,
      'veto' sensor, 'veto' light or 'veto' signal appearance will
      prevent the LRoute from being triggered. The logical
      expression defined by the LRoute is that the "non-veto
      entities are OR'ed together as a clause and the "veto"
      entities are AND'ed together as a clause. The two clauses are
      then joined by an AND operator.</p>

      <a name="setroutebehavior" id="setroutebehavior"></a>
      <h2>Setting Behavior to Match that of Routes</h2>

      <p>In Routes, the 'veto' entities are passive. That is,
      although the 'veto' state prevents the Route from triggering,
      when the 'veto' state is left, it does not trigger the Route.
      On the other hand, generally a Logix Conditional has all its
      state variable trigger actions when they change. The radio
      buttons on the 'LRoute Basics' tab <b>Route Logix
      Type</b> give either option. If you want the LRoute to
      perform in this passive manner as a Route does, press the
      <b>Old</b> button. If you want the LRoute to trigger its
      actions when all the 'veto's are removed, press the
      <b>New</b> button.</p>
