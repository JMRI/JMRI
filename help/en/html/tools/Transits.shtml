      <h1>JMRI: Transits Documentation</h1>

      <p>This document describes the characteristics of Transits.  Sections and
      Transits provide the foundation for the Dispatcher tool.</p>

      <h2>What is a Transit?</h2>

      <p>A <strong>Transit</strong> is a group of two or more connected
      <strong><a href="Sections.shtml">Sections</a></strong> that
      describes a route around the layout of a Train traveling in a
      given direction using JMRI <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a>.
      A Section may be in multiple Transits, and
      may be in a given Transit multiple times. Sections are kept
      in order&mdash;the first Section is connected to the second, the
      second is connected to the third, etc. That means a Section
      in a Transit must be connected to the Section before it (if
      there is one) and to the Section after it (if there is one).
      The order of the Sections determines the direction of travel
      in the Transit. Trains travel from Sections with lower
      sequence numbers toward Sections with higher sequence
      numbers. Normally Transits would only be defined for mainline
      track, and sometimes staging yard track.</p>

      <p>In user-specified areas of a Transit, <em>alternate</em>
      Sections may be designated. For example, to move between the
      "2nd" and "4th" Sections in a Transit, there may be multiple
      "3rd" Sections, any of which might be used to travel between
      the 2nd and 4th Sections. Alternate Sections provide for
      passing tracks and staging yards. Transits also provide for
      reverse loops. To provide for back-and-forth running, e.g.
      for trolley cars, an option is provided in Dispatcher to
      automatically reverse the direction of running through a
      Transit when the Train reaches the end of its Transit, and
      have the Train run in reverse to the beginning of its
      Transit.</p>

      <p>Transits support both Manual and Automatic operation of
      Trains. When a Train is running in automatic mode, Transits
      provide for <strong>Actions</strong> to be activated when the Train
      reaches a designated Section in the Transit. An Action may be
      initiated by a number of events, for example, when the Train
      enters a Section, or when the Train stops. A variety of
      actions are possible, such as pausing the Train for a
      user-designated number of fast clock minutes (a station
      stop), reverting to manual mode for local manual operation,
      or sounding the horn on a sound decoder.</p>

      <h2>How are Transits Activated and Used?</h2>

      <p>Transits are static objects. They specify itineraries for
      Trains to follow around the layout. Transits do not <em>run</em>
      trains, or <em>keep track</em> of running trains.
      A Transit becomes part of the train running process when it is
      <em>activated</em> by being assigned to an <strong>Active Train</strong>.
      Transits are saved as part of a Panel/Configuration file, only
      need to be set up once, and can be reused. Active Trains, on the other hand,
      are dynamic and transient.  Active Trains are not saved to disk, and must be
      set up each time they are used.</p>

      <p>Transits are <em>activated</em> in the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a>
      window, where a Transit is linked to a Train to create an Active Train.
      When an Active Train is created, a Transit is selected, a
      Train is selected, and a starting Block (Train location at
      start) and ending Block (Train location when travel is
      complete) are specified, along with options. This process
      results in an <strong>Active Train</strong>, which can then be
      dispatched. A Transit may be used by only one Active Train at
      a time.  When an Active Train is done, its Transit is <em>deactivated</em>,
      and may be reused for a subsequent Active Train.</p>

      <p>A Train may start from a Block outside of the Transit, but
      connected to a Block within the Transit, or a train may start
      from a Block within a Section in the Transit. A train moves
      through a Transit in only one direction--defined by the order
      in which Sections are included in the Transit. Trains move
      from lower sequence number Sections toward higher sequence
      number Sections. The only exception to this is the
      back-and-forth option that allows a train to run in reverse
      through its Transit back to the beginning of the Transit.</p>

      <p>When an Active Train is initiated, an <em>allocation</em>
      request is placed for a starting Section. If the Section is
      free, the Section will be <em>allocated</em> to the train.
      <em>Allocation</em> means that the Section is assigned the
      Active Train, and the train is authorized by the dispatcher
      to proceed to the end of that Section.</p>

      <p>When an Active Train is created, it may be activated for
      running by an engineer using a throttle, or automatically by
      a <em>virtual engineer</em>. Dispatching consists of
      <em>allocating</em> Sections, one by one, to the Active Train.
      The actual dispatching may be done by a dispatcher sitting at
      the computer running JMRI, or semi-automatically by the
      computer. If a requested Section is currently in use, a
      request for assignment is placed in the dispatcher's queue.
      When a Section is freed, the queue is scanned for the highest
      priority train requesting it.</p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>

      <p>Transits contain 2 or more Sections which contain one or more blocks
      with connectivity supplied by paths.  The paths are derived from a
      Layout Editor panel. Therefore a Layout Editor panel of your layout with
      Blocks assigned is required to create the necessary path information.  See
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor</a>
      for details on creating a Layout Editor panel.</p>

      <h2>How to setup Transits</h2>

      <h3>Displaying and creating Transits</h3>

      <p>All the Transits that JMRI knows about can be viewed using
      the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit
      Table</a>. Select <strong>Transits</strong> in the <strong>Tables</strong>
      submenu of the <strong>Tools</strong> menu of the main JMRI program
      window.

      <h3>Transit Table Controls</h3>

      <p>Below the Transit Table there's an <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TransitAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
      button.</p>

      <h3>Creating a new Transit</h3>

      <p>To Create a new Transit, click the "<a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TransitAddEdit.shtml">Add..."</a>
      button at the bottom of the Transit Table pane.

      <h3>Saving Transits to disk</h3>

      <p>Transits are kept in your <i>layout configuration</i>, along
      with Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads, Lights, control panel
      setup etc. To store this information on disk, allowing you to
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload
      it</a> next time you run JMRI, see <a href="../apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">
      Loading and Storing Your Work</a>.</p>
