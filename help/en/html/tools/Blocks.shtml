      <h2>What are Blocks?</h2>

      <p>Blocks are sections of track whose occupancy may be
      individually monitored. Dividing track into Blocks is
      optional. Blocks set up in a track diagram normally
      correspond to physical blocks on a layout. Block occupancy is
      indicated by the state of an occupancy <a href=
      "Sensors.shtml">Sensor</a>. When a layout's track is divided
      into Blocks, all of the track need not belong to a Block. For
      example, yard track may not be in a Block, whereas mainline
      track almost always would be divided into Blocks. The main
      use of Blocks is to facilitate Signaling, but Blocks may be
      used for other layout control and animation functions.</p>

      <h2>How to setup Blocks</h2>

      <h3>Block Properties</h3>

      <p>Blocks may be set up manually from the Block Table, using
      a script or automatically in a Layout Editor Panel. When a
      Block is defined on a Layout Editor Panel, a new Block is
      created if one does not already exist. In Layout Editor,
      Blocks are identified by their User Name, so if a Block shown
      in the Block Table is used in a Layout Editor Panel, its User
      Name should not be changed.<br>
      If you want to change the User Name of a Block used in a
      Layout Editor Panel, make the change in the Layout Editor,
      not in the Block Table.</p>

      <p>To complete the definition of a Block, Paths and Bean
      Settings must be attached to each Block. Paths describe entry
      points to the Block. Each Block has one or more Paths
      associated with it. Sometimes a Turnout must be set a certain
      way to use a Path; Bean Settings carry that information.
      Paths and Bean Settings are set up automatically for Blocks
      defined in a Layout Editor Panel. They can also be set up in
      a script. There is currently no way to manually enter Paths
      or Bean Settings. Paths and Bean Settings are not shown in
      the Block Table, and are described here only for
      completeness.<br>
      Paths may however be deleted using the <b>Paths</b> menu.</p>

      <h3>The Block Table</h3>

      <p>Blocks are created and edited in the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/BlockTable.shtml">Block
      Table</a>.</p>

      <p>For use in automatically running Trains, a Length
      attribute and a Curvature attribute may optionally be
      assigned to a Block. These optional attributes are entered
      manually in this table. If Trains will not be run
      automatically through a Block, there is no need to add these
      attributes.</p>

      <h4>Block Table controls</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Below the Block Table you'll find the
        <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/BlockAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
        button to add new Blocks.</li>

        <li>The <b>Paths</b> menu contains a <b>Delete Paths...</b>
        item.</li>

        <li>The <b>Speeds</b> menu lets you set system wide
        Defaults...</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="addBlock" id="addBlock"></a>
      <h3>Saving Blocks to disk</h3>

      <p>Blocks are saved in your layout configuration file, along
      with Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads, etc. To store this
      information on disk, use <b>Store Configuration...</b> in the
      <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Blocks Table (or other
      tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b>
      in the <b>Panel</b> menu. Note that the occupied/unoccupied
      state of each Block is not saved in the configuration file.
      When Blocks are loaded from a configuration file, their
      status is read from the Sensors.</p>
