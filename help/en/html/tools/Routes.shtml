      <h1>JMRI: Routes Documentation</h1>

      <h2>What are Routes?</h2>

      <p>Routes are collections of Turnouts and/or Sensors whose
      states may be set all at once. Also when a Route is
      triggered, a sound may be played, or a script may be run. For
      example, a Route may be set up to clear all turnouts on a
      mainline with one computer or fascia panel button. Routes may
      also be set up to control the setting of ladders of turnouts
      in staging areas or yards. Another use is to set layout
      turnouts to default positions when beginning an operating
      session. JMRI Routes are similar to the routes implemented in
      the Digitrax Chief system, except the JMRI Routes can mix
      turnouts controlled by different hardware systems, and also
      can set sensors, play a sound, or run a script.</p>

      <p>Optionally a Route may be controlled by up to three
      sensors and/or by a control turnout. When a Route is created,
      or when it is read from a configuration file, the Route is
      'activated'; it is set up to monitor automatically any
      changes in state of its control sensors and/or control
      turnout. When the controlling sensors or turnout change in
      the user-specified way, the Route is 'set' ('triggered');
      included turnouts and included sensors are set as specified,
      and if specified, a sound is played or a script is run.</p>

      <p>The Route Table contains an 'Enabled' column. For a Route
      to be triggered by its control sensors or its control
      turnout, it must be "enabled", that is its check box in the
      'Enabled' column must be checked. You can uncheck this box to
      temporarily disable a Route from being triggered, i.e.
      prevent it from setting its turnouts, sensors, etc. when a
      control sensor or control turnout changes.</p>

      <h3>The Route Table</h3>Routes can be viewed and configured
      using the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/RouteTable.shtml">Route
      Table</a>. It contains the following columns:

      <ul>
        <li>System Name</li>

        <li>User Name (optional)</li>

        <li>Comment (optional, double click to edit)</li>

        <li>Enabled (checkbox)</li>

        <li>Locked (checkbox)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Route Table Controls</h3>

      <p>Below the table is the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/RouteAddEdit.shtml"><b>Add...</b></a>
      button.</p>

      <h2>How to setup Routes</h2>

      <p>First make sure the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout
      Table</a> contains all Turnouts involved in the Routes to be
      defined, and that the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor
      Table</a> contains all Sensors needed.<br>
      Then select <b>Tools</b> -&gt; <b>Tables</b> -&gt;
      <b>Routes</b>, and click the <b>Add...</b> button at the
      bottom of the pane to bring up the Add/Edit Route
      pane.</p><a name="addroute" id="addroute"></a>

      <h3>Adding a new Route</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Enter a System Name, such as 'IR100' - any short name
          can be used provided it is different from the System Name
          of other Routes.</p>

          <p>By convention, System Names usually start with "IR"
          for <u>I</u>nternal <u>R</u>oute.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter a User Name. Any string of characters that is
          different from the User Name of other Routes will be
          accepted, but it's wise to use a string that describes
          the intended use of the Route.</p>

          <p>Note that before JMRI version 1.5.6, there was a bug
          that prevented you from having more than one blank
          (empty) User Name. In more recent versions, you can have
          as many Routes with blank User Names as you'd like; these
          have to be referenced via their System Names, of
          course.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select Turnouts to be included in the new Route in the
          list of all defined Turnouts, by clicking on the checkbox
          in the <b>Include</b> column. For each included Turnout,
          use the combo box in the <b>Set State</b> column to
          select whether that included Turnout is to be 'Set
          Closed', 'Set Thrown' or 'Toggle'd when the Route is
          'Set'. Don't worry if everything isn't perfect. It's easy
          to edit this information later.</p>

          <p>Note that the Add/Edit Route pane allows you to
          display 'All' Turnouts and Sensors or only the already
          'Included' Turnouts and Sensors. This is only for your
          convenience in checking that all desired Turnouts and/or
          Sensors have been included; it does not affect entered
          information.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Similarly, select Sensors to be included in the new
          Route in the list of all defined Sensors, by clicking on
          the checkbox in the <b>Include</b> column. For each
          included Sensor, use the combo box in the <b>Set
          State</b> column to select whether that Sensor is to be
          'Set Active', 'Set Inactive' or 'Toggle'd when the Route
          is 'Set'.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you want the Route to play a sound when it
          triggers, enter the file name of a sound file in the text
          box following 'Play sound file'. Clicking <b>Set</b> will
          bring up a file selection dialog to help locate the file.
          Once the file is located, clicking on its name in the
          dialog will copy it, complete with path, into the text
          box.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Similarly if you want a script to be run when the
          Route triggers, enter its file name into the text box on
          the right. The <b>Set</b> button can be used as above to
          assist in entering script file information.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you want the setting of the Route to be controlled
          by one or more input Sensors, enter their names (System
          Name or User Name) and select what kind of logic they'll
          obey. Logic choices are described in detail <a href=
          "#sensorlogic">below</a>.</p>

          <p>When you save and restore your Routes using a
          configuration file, the Sensor name you enter here is
          used to recreate the Route. A System Name will always be
          associated with the same input Sensor. A User Name can be
          moved to another input by changing the entries in the
          Sensor Table. For example, "East OS Occupancy" could be
          changed from LocoNet Sensor input LS12 to LS24 by just
          associating that User Name with a different System Name;
          this makes layout rewiring easy. User Names entered here
          must exist however; if you change the Sensor's User Name
          from "East OS Occupancy" to "East Occupancy", the Route
          won't load properly until you edit it to use the new
          name.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Also optional, if you want to enable setting of the
          Route when a particular Turnout changes state, enter a
          Turnout name (System Name or User Name) and select the
          logic that it will obey. Logic choices are explained in
          detail <a href="#turnoutlogic">below</a>.</p>

          <p>When you save and restore your Routes using a
          configuration file, the Turnout name you enter here is
          used to recreate the Route. A System Name will always be
          associated with the same Turnout. A User Name can be
          moved to another Turnout by changing the entries in the
          Turnout Table. For example, "Set Track 5" could be
          changed from LocoNet Control Turnout 105 to Turnout 5 by
          just associating that User Name with a different System
          Name; this makes layout rewiring easy. User Names entered
          here must exist however; if you change the Turnout's User
          Name from "Set Track 5" to "Set Trk 5", the Route won't
          load properly until you edit it to use the new name.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The "Added delay" entry is normally left at "0". When
          a Route sets its Turnouts, it waits 250 milliseconds
          between Turnout control commands. If this is not enough
          time between commands for your type of Turnout control,
          you can increase the time between commands by entering an
          added delay (in milliseconds).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Click the <b>Add Route</b> button at the bottom of the
          pane. If everything is fine, a message stating "New Route
          added ... " will be displayed in the notes box near the
          bottom of the pane. If there is trouble with anything, an
          error message will be displayed in the notes box; you
          should then correct the error and click <b>Add Route</b>
          again.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Editing an existing Route</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Edit of an existing Route may be started in either of
        two ways:

          <ul>
            <li>Click on a Route's <b>Edit</b> button in the Route
            Table.</li>

            <li>Enter the System Name of the Route to be edited in
            the Add/Edit Route pane and click the <b>Edit Route</b>
            button at the bottom of the pane. This must be the same
            as one of the System Names shown in the Route
            Table.</li>
          </ul>The <b>Add Route</b> and <b>Edit Route</b> buttons
          in the Add/Edit Route pane will change to <b>Update
          Route</b> and <b>Cancel</b>.
        </li>

        <li>Make whatever changes or additions you need to the
        information in the dialog. Note that the System Name of the
        edited Route may not be changed, but the User Name may be
        changed. Other items are as described <a href=
        "#addroute">above</a>.</li>

        <li>After making changes to the Route information, click
        <b>Update Route</b> to change the selected Route. If
        everything is fine, a message stating "Route updated... "
        will be displayed in the notes box near the bottom of the
        window. If there is any trouble, an error message will be
        displayed in the notes box, and the update is stopped for
        you to correct the error and click <b>Update Route</b>
        again.</li>

        <li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit edit mode without changing
        the selected Route. If the Add/Edit Route window is
        dismissed (closed) while in edit mode, <b>Cancel</b> is
        automatically selected, and no changes are made to the
        selected Route.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Setting (trigger) a Route</h3>

      <p>Routes may be 'set' by clicking the <b>Set</b> button in
      the State column of the Route Table. A Route may also be set
      by fascia panel buttons if Sensors for these buttons are
      defined as control Sensors in the Route information. If a
      control Turnout is defined in the Route information, throwing
      or closing that Turnout from your physical throttle will also
      trigger the Route. Note that control Turnouts may be real
      turnouts, phantom turnouts, or internal turnouts as described
      <a href="#turnoutlogic">below</a>. A Route may also be
      triggered from a Logix, as the action of one of its
      conditionals. If you need more powerful logic to control your
      Route than provided by the Route itself, consider using a
      <a href="Logix.shtml">Logix</a>.</p>

      <p>Note that enabled/disabled and 'veto' logic discussed
      below for control <a href="#sensorlogic">Sensors</a> and for
      the control <a href="#turnoutlogic">Turnout</a> apply only to
      a Route's automated control mechanism. Neither 'disabled' nor
      'veto' logic will prevent a Route from being set (triggered)
      using the <b>Set</b> button or from a Logix.</p>

      <p>It's also useful to note that when a Route has been
      triggered and is actively sending commands to Turnouts, the
      Route is marked as busy until this operation is complete. A
      Route cannot be triggered again while it is busy, i.e. until
      its current operation is complete.</p>

      <h3>Saving Routes to disk</h3>

      <p>Routes are kept in your <i>layout configuration</i>, along
      with Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads, Lights, control panel
      setup etc. To store this information on disk, allowing to
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload
      it</a> next time you run JMRI, use <b>Store Configuration...</b>
      in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Route Table (or
      other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store
      Panel...</b> in the <b>Panel</b> menu. Note that the
      enabled/disabled state of each Route is not saved in the
      configuration file. When Routes are loaded from a
      configuration file, they are all enabled.</p>

      <a name="sensorlogic" id="sensorlogic"></a>
      <h3>Controlling Routes from Sensors</h3>
      <p>The operation of a
      Route can be controlled by up to three Sensors. These can be
      connected to occupancy detectors or switches on the layout,
      or even just used to operate the Route from a control Panel
      on the computer. These Sensors can be real sensors or
      internal sensors.</p>

      <p>By default, when any one of the defined Sensors goes to
      the Active state, the Route will be set. This could be used
      to e.g. set a Route when a Block became occupied, or when a
      button was pushed.</p>

      <p>More powerful logic can also do things like "define Routes
      to have the position of a Turnout follow the position of a
      panel switch". For this, each of the three Sensors has a
      "mode" associated with it, which can be:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>"On Active"</dt>

        <dd>The default method, the Route is triggered when the
        Sensor goes Active, e.g. "Throw Turnout 12 when Sensor 12
        goes Active"</dd>

        <dt>"On Inactive"</dt>

        <dd>The Route is triggered when the Sensor goes Inactive.
        For example, using the Route above, plus a second Route
        "Close Turnout 12 when Sensor 12 goes Inactive" will have
        Turnout 12 follow a panel switch connected to Sensor 12 as
        it is flipped back and forth.</dd>

        <dt>"On Change"</dt>

        <dd>The Route is triggered when the Sensor state changes,
        either from Active to Inactive or from Inactive to
        Active.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto Active"</dt>

        <dd>If this Sensor is Active, other Sensors set to "On
        Active", "On Inactive" "On Change" will be ignored, and a
        control Turnout set to "On Closed", "On Thrown", or "On
        Change" will also be ignored. This has several uses, e.g.
        to prevent throwing a Turnout under a train when the Block
        shows occupied.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto Inactive"</dt>

        <dd>Like Veto Active, but the other polarity logic.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Note that there is an implied "and/or" here. All of the
      'veto' Sensors and the 'veto' Turnout, if there is one, must
      be in their non-veto state _and_ at least one of the
      triggering Sensors or a triggering Turnout must see the
      appropriate change for the Route to be set.</p>

      <a name="turnoutlogic" id="turnoutlogic"></a>
      <h3>Controlling Routes from a Turnout</h3>

      <p>The setting (triggering) of a Route can be controlled from
      a Turnout. This Turnout can be a real physical turnout, a
      'phantom' turnout (a DCC Turnout number with no corresponding
      physical turnout), or an 'internal' turnout.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If a real turnout is used, the real turnout will
        receive the original activation command, and then the Route
        will set whatever Turnout positions and/or Sensor states
        were specified. This can be used to set multiple Turnouts
        to match the original real turnout, or to set the turnout
        back to its original position (if you don't want anybody
        changing it), etc. The Route will fire when the Turnout is
        set from JMRI, and/or with some DCC systems (Digitrax
        LocoNet and Lenz XPressNet systems), it will fire when a
        layout operator commands the Turnout to change state on a
        handheld throttle.</li>

        <li>A 'Phantom Turnout' is a DCC Turnout that doesn't
        actually exist. To use one, just create a Turnout entry for
        an address number that doesn't exist on your layout. The
        layout operators can select that phantom Turnout number on
        their throttles and send commands to it to cause the Route
        to be set. With the addition of Sensors as vetos in the
        Route, you can do things like only allowing Operators to
        change Turnouts (via the Route) when the Dispatcher has set
        a button to allow local access.</li>

        <li>An 'Internal Turnout' is one that only exists within
        the JMRI software; it doesn't correspond to any particular
        address on the layout, and it particularly doesn't
        correspond to any hardware on the layout. The system name
        for Internal Turnouts start with "IT", e.g. "IT201". JMRI
        knows that these are separate from the layout, so it
        doesn't send any commands to the attached hardware when one
        changes. Internal Turnouts can be used with Routes to build
        complicated logic underlying control Panels. For example,
        an icon on a Panel can set an Internal Turnout, which in
        turn can set the Turnouts of an entire yard ladder.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Similar to the Control Sensors discussed above, the
      Control Turnout has a "mode" associated with it, which can
      be:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>"On Closed"</dt>

        <dd>The default method, the Route is triggered when the
        Turnout changes to the Closed state.</dd>

        <dt>"On Thrown"</dt>

        <dd>The Route is triggered when the Turnout changes to the
        Thrown state.</dd>

        <dt>"On Change"</dt>

        <dd>The Route is triggered when the Turnout state changes,
        either from Closed to Thrown or from Thrown to Closed.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto Closed"</dt>

        <dd>If this Turnout is Closed, Sensors set to "On Active",
        "On Inactive" "On Change" will be ignored.</dd>

        <dt>"Veto Thrown"</dt>

        <dd>If this Turnout is Thrown, Sensors set to "On Active",
        "On Inactive" "On Change" will be ignored.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>A single 'veto' Turnout or 'veto' Sensor can prevent the
      Route from being triggered. All of the 'veto' Sensors and the
      'veto' Turnout, if there is one, must be in their non-veto
      state _and_ at least one of the triggering Sensors or a
      triggering Turnout must see the appropriate change for the
      Route to be set.</p>
