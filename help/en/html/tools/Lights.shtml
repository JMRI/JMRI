    <h1>JMRI: Lights Documentation</h1>

    <h2>What are Lights?</h2>

      <p>Lights are digital output bits that function as on/off
      switches.</p>
      <p>Lights were created to provide easy control for
      fascia panel lights and scenery lighting, though can also be
      used for any purpose that requires an on/off switch. 
      <br>A light can be used, for example, to activate an electromagnetic
      decoupler for a pre-determined time in response to a fascia
      panel button.</p>
      
      <p>Originally developed for use with C/MRI, Lights
      are also implemented on many other hardware types, 
      including Powerline X10 and DMX512 systems.</p>
      
      <p>Some Lights can have a 
      <a title="Variable Light Brigtness" href="#variablelight">variable intensity</a>
      ( brightness ).  This is commonly used with the FastClock to 
      produce gradual transition between day and night scenes.</p>

      <p>Lights should be used if you need a simple
      mechanism to control scenery lighting, panel lights or for
      other general on / off tasks.</p>

      <p>Lights contain a number of "Light Control" 
      automation options, an easy way of setting up basic logic and interfacing 
      with Sensors, Turnouts or a Fast Clock.</p>

      <p>Since Lights lack the feedback
      structure of Turnouts, Lights should not be used to control
      track switches (Turnouts) on the layout; only Turnouts should
      be used to control track switches.
      <br>For historical reasons,
      Signal Head appearances are defined using Turnouts, even
      though they may actually be physical lights. Turnouts
      should be used to reference the digital output bits used with
      JMRI Signal Heads.</p>

    <h2>How to setup Lights</h2>

    <h3>The Light Table</h3>

      <p>Lights are managed in the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightTable.shtml">Light
      Table</a>.</p>

      <p>Below the Light Table there's an <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
      button, for each Light row there's Edit and Delete buttons.</p>

        Light window</a>.</p>
        
    <h4>Saving and Loading Lights</h4>

      <p>Lights are kept in your <i>layout configuration</i> xml file, along
      with Turnouts, Sensors, control panel setup etc.</p>
      
      <p>To save this information, allowing you to
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload
      it</a> next time you run JMRI, use <b>Store Configuration...</b>
      in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Light Table (or other
      tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b>
      in the <b>Panel</b> menu.</p>
      
      <p>When a Light with no Light Control is loaded into the Light Table, it
      will default to an Off state.</p>
      
      <p>The Light Control is enabled on loading, so
      will automatically monitor any changes in state of its control
      Sensor, Turnout, or Fast Clock.</p>
      
      <p>The Light Control enabled / disabled
      state for each Light is not saved in the configuration file.
      When Lights are loaded from a configuration file, they are
      all enabled.</p>

    <h3><a name="variablelight" id="variablelight">Variable Lights</a></h3>
      
      <p>A variable Light allows for a variable number of
      intensities between on and off. The typical use would be for
      layout lighting simulating the changes for the time of day
      and night.</p>
      
      <p>Only some forms of Lights have the ability to be
      variable. Examples would include Internal and PowerLine
      devices.</p>

      <p>A variable Light is adjusted by an intensity setting. The
      range of the intensity is from 0.00 for full Off to 1.00
      which is full On. User entry for the intensity will either
      use a floating point value from 0 to 1 or a percentage value
      of 0% to 100%.</p>

      <p>Depending on the hardware used, some variable Lights will
      make an initialization adjustment when switching from simple
      on/off mode to using intensity settings. On such devices this
      will not be needed again as long as <b>only</b> intensity
      setting commands are used. Mixing on/off commands may require
      the initialization to occur again.</p>

      <p>A Variable Light has three types of operators:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><b>On</b></dt>

        <dd>This operation will turn a Variable Light on. It will
        over-ride any current intensity and set the intensity to 1.
        <br>If there are any transition effects enabled, they will be
        ignored and intensity will go to the maximum amount.</dd>

        <dt><b>Off</b></dt>

        <dd>This operation will turn a Variable Light off. It will
        over-ride any current intensity and set the intensity to 0.
        <br>If there are any transition effects enabled, they will be
        ignored and intensity will go to the maximum amount.</dd>

        <dt><b>Set Intensity</b></dt>

        <dd>This operation will set a target intensity for the
        Variable Light.<br>If the interface supports transition
        effects and they are configured, the Light will make a
        controlled transition from the current setting to the new
        setting.</dd>
      </dl>

    <h4><a name="VariableLightSettings" id="VariableLightSettings">Variable Light Settings</a></h4>
      
      <p>These settings adjust how the 'set intensity' command is used.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><b>Minimum Intensity:</b></dt>

        <dd>A value 0 to 100 (percent) that sets the lowest amount
        of light that will be output by a dim command. 
        <br>An explicit Off command will ignore this value.</dd>

        <dt><b>Maximum Intensity:</b></dt>

        <dd>A value 0 to 100 (percent) that sets the highest amount
        of light that will be output by a dim command.
        <br>An explicit On command will ignore this value.</dd>

        <dt><b>Transition Time:</b></dt>

        <dd>Number of Fast Clock minutes to go from 0% to 100%
        intensity. 
        <br>A value of zero will cause the device to change
        from one intensity to new intensity as fast as the device
        is able to do so.</dd>
      </dl>
