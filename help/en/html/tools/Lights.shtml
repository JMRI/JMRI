    <h2><a name="what" id="what">What are Lights and How Are They Used?</a></h2>

      <p>Lights were created to provide an easy way to control fascia panel lights and scenery 
      lighting.  They can be used for any purpose that requires an on/off switch, for example, 
      to activate an electromagnetic decoupler for a pre-determined time in response to a fascia
      panel button, or to play a layout sound via a stationary decoder, or to start or stop an 
      animation triggered by a sensor.  In general, Lights provide simple mechanism to control any
      on/off task on the railroad.</p>
      
      <p>Originally developed for use with <a href="../hardware/cmri/CMRI.shtml">C/MRI</a>, Lights
      are also implemented on many other hardware types, including <a href="../hardware/powerline/index.shtml">
      Powerline X10</a> and <a href="../hardware/anyma/index.shtml">Anyma DMX512 </a>systems.</p>
      
      <p>Lights share available digital output bits with Turnouts.
      Either a Light or a Turnout, but not both, can control a
      specific digital output bit. Since Lights lack the feedback
      structure of Turnouts, Lights should not be used to control
      track switches (turnouts) on the layout; only Turnouts should
      be used to control track switches. For historical reasons,
      Signal Head appearances are defined using Turnouts, even
      though they may actually be physical lights. So Turnouts
      should be used to reference the digital output bits used with
      JMRI Signal Heads. Lights should be used if you need a simple
      mechanism to control scenery lighting or panel lights, or for
      other on/off tasks where the control mechanisms of Lights fit
      the need.</p>
      
      <p>Lights can be turned on or off by clicking the status column in the 
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightTable.shtml">
      Lights Table.</a> They can aslo be automatically controlled:</p> 

      <ul>
        <li>by a single Sensor</li>
        <li>by two Sensors</li>
        <li>by a Turnout</li>
        <li>by the JMRI Fast Clock</li>
        <li>or switched on for a specified time by a Sensor.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>One or more of these controls may be specified when the Light is created or edited
      (in the Light Table} as an easy way of setting up basic logic and interfacing  with 
      Sensors, Turnouts or a Fast Clock. When a Light is created, or when it is read from a
      configuration file, the Light is 'activated'; it is set up to monitor automatically
      any changes in state of these controls. When the controlling Sensor, Turnout, or Fast
      Clock changes, the Light is switched on or off. Lights can also be controlled by 
      <a href="LogixTable.shtml">Logix</a> if more complicated control logic is needed.</p>   
      
      <p>Depending on the hardware interfacing with your Lights, they can be specified as
      <a href="#variablelight">variable intensity</a> (brightness) rather than just on/off.
      This is commonly used with the Fast Clock to produce gradual transition between day 
      and night scenes.</p>

    <h2><a name="saving" id="saving">Saving and Loading Lights</a></h2>

      <p>Like other JMRI objects such as turnouts and sensors, the Lights in your Light Table
      are kept in your  <i>layout configuration</i> xml file. To save this information, allowing 
      you to <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload it</a> next 
      time you run JMRI, use <b>Store Configuration...</b> in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of

      in the <b>Panel</b> menu.</p>
       
      <p>The Light Control is enabled on loading, so will automatically monitor any changes in 
      state of its control sensor, turnout, or fast clock.  When a Light with no Light Control
      is loaded into the Light Table, it will default to an Off state.</p>
      
      <p class="note">The enabled/disabled state of a Light is not saved in the configuration file. 
      When Lights are loaded from a configuration file, they are all enabled.</p>

    <h2><a name="lightcontrol" id="lightcontrol">Controlling Lights - Setting On/Off/Intensity</a></h2>
    
    <p>There are several ways to turn a light on or off, both manual and automated. Lights can be
    turned on or off manually by clicking the button in the State column of the Light Table. A Light
    can also be controlled by one or more of the following:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>the state of a track switch (Turnout), On when the Turnout is Closed, and Off when it
        is Thrown, or vice versa</li>
        <li>the state of a block occupancy sensor, on when the sensor is active, and off when it is
        inactive, or vice versa</li>
        <li>a fascia panel button if a Sensor for that button is defined as the control Sensor. </li>
        <li>the JMRI Fast Clock, On for a specified time period, then Off</li>
        <li>two Sensors, On when either of the two Sensors is Active (or Inactive); two sensor 
        control is useful in controlling layout sounds or crossing gates</li>
        <li>a Logix, as the action of one of its conditionals; <a href="LogixTable.shtml">Logix</a>
        should be considered if you need more complex logic to control your Lights</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note that Enabled/Disabled applies only to a Light's
      automated control mechanism. A 'Disabled' state will not
      prevent a Light from being turned on or off using the button
      in the Light Table or from being controlled by a Logix.</p>

      <p>A variable Light may also be adjusted by entering a value
      of 0.00 to 1.00 in the <b>intensity column</b> for the Light.
      A Light that does not support variable intensities will
      consider any non zero value as meaning On. If a Light has
      transition effects enabled and configured, the Light will
      respond according to those options.  See <a href="#variablelight"> below </a>
      for more information on variable Lights.</p>

    <h2><a name="variablelight" id="variablelight">Variable Lights</a></h2>
      
      <p>A <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightAddEdit.shtml#varLight">
      variable intensity light</a> allows for a variable number of
      intensities between on and off. The typical use would be for
      layout lighting simulating the changes for the time of day
      and night.</p>
      
      <p>Only some forms of Lights have the ability to be
      variable. Examples would include Internal and PowerLine
      devices.</p>

      <p>A variable Light is adjusted by an intensity setting. The
      range of the intensity is from 0.00 for full Off to 1.00
      which is full On. User entry for the intensity will either
      use a floating point value from 0 to 1 or a percentage value
      of 0% to 100%.</p>

      <p>Depending on the hardware used, some variable Lights will
      make an initialization adjustment when switching from simple
      on/off mode to using intensity settings. On such devices this
      will not be needed again as long as <b>only</b> intensity
      setting commands are used. Mixing on/off commands may require
      the initialization to occur again.</p>
      
      <p>The status button for a variable Light in the Light Table will also be a status 
      indication of the variable Light. When it is not On or Off it will show if the last
      change in intensity was moving higher or lower. The intensity displayed will be the
      current intensity, not the target intensity, when transition effects are enabled.</p>

      <p>A Variable Light has three types of operators:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><b>On</b></dt>

        <dd>This operation will turn a Variable Light on. It will
        over-ride any current intensity and set the intensity to 1.
        <br>If there are any transition effects enabled, they will be
        ignored and intensity will go to the maximum amount.</dd>

        <dt><b>Off</b></dt>

        <dd>This operation will turn a Variable Light off. It will
        over-ride any current intensity and set the intensity to 0.
        <br>If there are any transition effects enabled, they will be
        ignored and intensity will go to the maximum amount.</dd>

        <dt><b>Set Intensity</b></dt>

        <dd>This operation will set a target intensity for the
        Variable Light.<br>If the interface supports transition
        effects and they are configured, the Light will make a
        controlled transition from the current setting to the new
        setting.</dd>
      </dl>

    <h3><a name="VariableLightSettings" id="VariableLightSettings">Variable Light Settings</a></h3>
      
      <p>These settings adjust how the 'set intensity' command is used.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><b>Minimum Intensity:</b></dt>

        <dd>A value 0 to 100 (percent) that sets the lowest amount
        of light that will be output by a dim command. 
        <br>An explicit Off command will ignore this value.</dd>

        <dt><b>Maximum Intensity:</b></dt>

        <dd>A value 0 to 100 (percent) that sets the highest amount
        of light that will be output by a dim command.
        <br>An explicit On command will ignore this value.</dd>

        <dt><b>Transition Time:</b></dt>

        <dd>Number of Fast Clock minutes to go from 0% to 100%
        intensity. 
        <br>A value of zero will cause the device to change
        from one intensity to new intensity as fast as the device
        is able to do so.</dd>
