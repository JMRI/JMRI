      <h2>JMRI: Block Tracking</h2>

      <h3>Background Information</h3>Model railroad control systems
      generally can't tell you which train occupies a particular
      piece of track at any given time.

      <p>This is unfortunate, because there are lots of reasons you
      might want to know. For example, you might want to command
      any train that reaches a particular red signal to stop. But
      you can't do that unless you know <i>which</i> train it is
      that is reaching the signal.</p>

      <p>JMRI provides experimental tools for tracking trains as
      them move around on the layout.</p>

      <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>Imagine a simple loop of track that's
      been wired with occupancy sensors on individual segments of
      track, which we'll call "Blocks". Imagine the train is in
      Block A, and will shortly move to Block B, then C.

      <p>At first the sensor for Block A is showing active. As the
      train moves into Block B, the Sensor for B will go active.
      When the train has completely left A, it's sensor will go
      inactive etc.</p>

      <p>Although a particular Block only knows whether it's active
      or not (occupied or not), by also looking at the occupancy of
      the adjacent Blocks it can tell more. In the example above,
      if the code knew that train 321 was in Block A, when Block B
      goes active, the program can infer that 321 is now also in
      Block B.</p>

      <p>This doesn't always work, unfortunately. Imagine the case
      above, where there is both a train in Block A and also a
      train in Block C. When Block B goes from inactive to active
      (unoccupied to occupied), which train moved in? The one from
      A, or the one from C?</p>

      <p>Some of this ambiguity can be removed by careful
      arrangement of the detection Blocks, by accepting limitations
      on how trains can run (or how short Blocks have to be), and
      by using more intelligent logic that thinks about the
      direction and priority of trains. But it's clear that even
      straight track poses some problems.</p>

      <p>Turnouts add an additional layer of complexity. Imagine a
      train is sitting in the Block next to the normal (closed)
      route, and another is sitting in the reversed (thrown) route.
      When the occupancy Sensor for the Turnout goes active, which
      Train has entered the Turnout track? That depends on which
      way the Turnout is set, so the program needs to be able to
      consider that information too.</p>

      <h2>JMRI Block Tools</h2>JMRI provides a "Block" class to
      handle the tracking.

      <p>Note that this is test code, and not all features are
      completely present. For example, you cannot store Block
      objects in a Configuration file; they must be manually
      created in your scripts. This limitations will be removed
      with time.</p>

      <h3>Block Table</h3>The <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/BlockTable.shtml">Block
      Table</a> lets you see the status of your Blocks.

      <h3>Issues</h3>There is no functional requirement for a type
      letter in the System Name, but by convention we use 'B' for
      'Block'. The default implementation is not system-specific,
      so a system letter of 'I' is appropriate. This leads to
      system names like "IB201".

      <p>The direction of a Block is set from the direction of the
      incoming train. When a train is found to be coming in on a
      particular Path, that Path's getFromBlockDirection becomes
      the direction of the train in this Block.</p>

      <p>Issues:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Doesn't handle a train pulling in behind another well:

          <ul>
            <li>When the 2nd train arrives, the Sensor is already
            active, so the value is unchanged (but the value can
            only be a single object anyway)</li>

            <li>When the 1st train leaves, the Sensor stays active,
            so the value remains that of the 1st train</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>The assumption is that a train will only go through a
        set turnout. For example, a train could come into the
        turnout Block from the main even if the turnout is set to
        the siding. (Ignoring those layouts where this would cause
        a short; it doesn't do so on all layouts)</li>

        <li>Does not handle closely-following trains where there is
        only one electrical Block per Signal. To do this, it
        probably needs some type of "assume a train doesn't back
        up" logic. A better solution is to have multiple sensors
        and Block objects between each signal head.</li>

        <li>If a train reverses in a Block and goes back the way it
        came (e.g. b1 to b2 to b1), the Block that's re-entered
        will get an updated direction, but the direction of this
        Block (b2 in the example) is not updated. In other words,
        we're not noticing that the train must have reversed to go
        back out.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Do not assume that only one Block object uniquely
      represents a piece of track. To allow independent
      development, it must be possible for multiple Block objects
      to take care of a particular section of track.</p>
