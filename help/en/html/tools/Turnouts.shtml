        <h1>JMRI: Turnouts Documentation</h1>

        <h2>What are Turnouts?</h2>

        <p>JMRI calls just about any output to the layout a "Turnout". Originally, JMRI controlled
        just Turnouts via DCC accessory decoders. As time went on, JMRI added more capability, but
        has kept that name. Now, for example, the individual output pins on a C/MRI system are also
        referenced via the "Turnout" name.</p>

        <h2>How to setup Turnouts</h2>

        <h3>Turnout Properties</h3>

        <p>Turnouts are created and edited in the <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table</a>.<br>
        A range of <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml#columns">columns</a> shows the
        settings for each Turnout.<br>
        Along the bottom are <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml#controls">checkboxes</a> to display
        additional columns.</p>

        <h3>Controlling a Turnout</h3>

        <p>The two states of the output are called "Closed" and "Thrown". "Closed" is the off,
        inactive, not commanded state. "Thrown" is the on, active, commanded state.</p>

        <p>In most cases, you can just operate a Turnout and JMRI will figure out what you mean.
        For example, you can open the "Turnout Control" tool from the "Tools" menu, enter a Turnout
        number (DCC or C/MRI address number), and click Thrown or Closed. JMRI will take it from
        there.</p>

        <h3>Saving Turnout configuration to disk</h3>

        <p>The Turnout definitions are kept in your <em>layout configuration</em>, along with
        Sensors, Signal Heads, control panel setup etc. To store this information on disk, allowing
        you to <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload it</a> next
        time you run JMRI, see <a href="../apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">Loading and Storing Your
        Work</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="add">Adding a new Turnout</h3>

        <p>To fully configure a new Turnout, follow this procedure:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Click <strong>Tables</strong> &rArr; <strong>Turnouts</strong> in the
            <strong>Tools</strong> menu to bring up the <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table</a>, and click
            the <strong>Add...</strong> button at the bottom of the pane to bring up the <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutAddEdit.shtml">Add/Edit Turnout
            pane</a>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>From the <strong>System</strong> drop down list select the system to which the
            Turnout address is connected to. In the <strong>Hardware Address</strong> field enter
            the dcc accessory address of the Turnout.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Enter a User Name. Any string of characters that is different from the User Name of
            other Turnouts will be accepted, but it's wise to use a string that describes the
            intended use of the Turnout. You can leave this blank if you'd like.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If you wish to add a number of Turnouts at once, click on the <strong>Add a
            Range</strong> checkbox and then in the <strong>Number to Add</strong> field enter the
            number of Turnouts that you wish to add. If you have entered a User Name, then this
            will be appended with a number to ensure that each User Name is unique. If a hardware
            address already exists in the range that is being added, then the system will skip that
            address and carry on.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button at the bottom of the pane. If everything is
            fine, the new Turnout will appear in the Turnout Table. If there is trouble with
            anything, an error or warning message will be displayed on screen; you should correct
            the error and click <strong>OK</strong> again.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Back in the main Turnout Table, you can now set <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml#Turnout_Feedback">options</a>
            for the Turnout by clicking its <strong>Edit</strong> button, and control it by
            clicking its <strong>Cmd</strong> button.</p>
          </li>
