<h1>JMRI: Turnouts Documentation</h1>

<h2>What are Turnouts?</h2>

<p>JMRI calls just about any output to the layout a "Turnout".  
Originally, JMRI controlled just Turnouts via DCC accessory decoders.
As time went on, JMRI added more capability, but has kept that name.
Now, for example, the individual output pins on a C/MRI system
are also referenced via the "Turnout" name.
</p>

<h2>How to setup Turnouts</h2>

<h3>Controlling a Turnout</h3>
<p>
The two states of the output are called "Closed" and "Thrown".  
"Closed" is the off, inactive, not commanded state.
"Thrown" is the on, active, commanded state.</p>
<p>
In most cases, you can just operate a Turnout and JMRI will 
figure out why you mean.  
For example, you can open the "Turnout Control" tool
from the "Tools" menu, enter a Turnout number (DCC or C/MRI address number),
and click Thrown or Closed. JMRI will take it from there.
</p>
   
<h3>Saving Turnout configuration to disk</h3>

<p>The Turnout definitions are saved in your layout configuration file, along with 
Sensors, Signal Heads, etc. To store this information on disk, use <b>Store 
Configuration...</b> in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Turnouts 
Table (or other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b>
in the <b>Panel</b> menu. 

<a name="add"><h3>Adding a new Turnout</h3></a>
<p>To fully configure a new Turnout, follow this procedure:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><p>Click <b>Tables</b> -&gt; <b>Turnouts</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu to bring up
		the Turnout Table, and click the <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom of the 
		pane to bring up the Add/Edit Turnout window.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>From the <b>System</b> drop down list select the system to which the 
		Turnout address is connected to. In the <b>Hardware Address</b> field enter the
		dcc accessory address of the Turnout.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Enter a User Name. Any string of characters that is different 
		from the User Name of other Turnouts will be accepted, but it's 
		wise to use a string that describes the intended use of the Turnout.
		You can leave this blank if you'd like.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>If you wish to add a number of Turnouts at once, click on the 
		<b>Add a Range</b> checkbox and then in the <b>Number to Add</b> field enter
		the number of Turnouts that you wish to add. If you have entered a User
		Name, then this will be appended with a number to ensure that each User Name
		is unique. If a hardware address already exists in the range that is being
		added, then the system will skip that address and carry on.
		</li>
		<li><p>Click the <b>OK</b> button at the bottom of the pane.  
		If everything is fine, a message stating "New Turnout added..." will be 
		displayed in the notes area. If there is trouble with anything, an error or 
		warning message will be displayed in the notes area; you should then
		correct the error and click <b>OK</b> again.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Back in the main Turnout Table, you can now select
		options for the Turnout and control it by clicking on its State button.
		</li>
		</ol>
