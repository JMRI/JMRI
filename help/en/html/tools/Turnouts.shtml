        <h1>JMRI: Turnouts Documentation</h1>

        <h2>What are Turnouts?</h2>

        <p>JMRI calls just about any output to the layout a
        "Turnout". Originally, JMRI controlled just Turnouts via
        DCC accessory decoders. As time went on, JMRI added more
        capability, but has kept that name. Now, for example, the
        individual output pins on a C/MRI system are also
        referenced via the "Turnout" name.</p>

        <h2>How to setup Turnouts</h2>

        <h3>Turnout Properties</h3>

        <p>Turnouts are created and edited in the <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout
        Table</a>.<br>
        A range of <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml#columns">
        columns</a> shows the settings for each Turnout.<br>
        Along the bottom are <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml#controls">
        checkboxes</a> to display additional columns.</p>

        <h3>Controlling a Turnout</h3>

        <p>The two states of the output are called "Closed" and
        "Thrown". "Closed" is the off, inactive, not commanded
        state. "Thrown" is the on, active, commanded state.</p>

        <p>In most cases, you can just operate a Turnout and JMRI
        will figure out what you mean. For example, you can open
        the "Turnout Control" tool from the "Tools" menu, enter a
        Turnout number (DCC or C/MRI address number), and click
        Thrown or Closed. JMRI will take it from there.</p>

        <h3>Saving Turnout configuration to disk</h3>

        <p>The Turnout definitions are kept in your <i>layout
        configuration</i>, along with Sensors, Signal Heads,
        control panel setup etc.
        To store this information on disk, allowing you to
        <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload
        it</a> next time you run JMRI, see <a href="../apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">
        Loading and Storing Your Work</a>.</p>

        <a name="add" id="add"></a>
        <h3>Adding a new Turnout</h3>

        <p>To fully configure a new Turnout, follow this
        procedure:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Click <b>Tables</b> &rArr; <b>Turnouts</b> in the
            <b>Tools</b> menu to bring up the <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">
            Turnout Table</a>, and click the <b>Add...</b> button
            at the bottom of the pane to bring up the <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutAddEdit.shtml">
            Add/Edit Turnout pane</a>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>From the <b>System</b> drop down list select the
            system to which the Turnout address is connected to. In
            the <b>Hardware Address</b> field enter the dcc
            accessory address of the Turnout.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Enter a User Name. Any string of characters that is
            different from the User Name of other Turnouts will be
            accepted, but it's wise to use a string that describes
            the intended use of the Turnout. You can leave this
            blank if you'd like.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If you wish to add a number of Turnouts at once,
            click on the <b>Add a Range</b> checkbox and then in
            the <b>Number to Add</b> field enter the number of
            Turnouts that you wish to add. If you have entered a
            User Name, then this will be appended with a number to
            ensure that each User Name is unique. If a hardware
            address already exists in the range that is being
            added, then the system will skip that address and carry
            on.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Click the <b>OK</b> button at the bottom of the
            pane. If everything is fine, the new Turnout will
            appear in the Turnout Table. If there is trouble with
            anything, an error or warning message will be displayed
            on screen; you should correct the error and click
            <b>OK</b> again.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Back in the main Turnout Table, you can now set
            <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml#Turnout_Feedback">
            options</a> for the Turnout by clicking its
            <strong>Edit</strong> button, and control it by
            clicking its <b>Cmd</b> button.</p>
          </li>
