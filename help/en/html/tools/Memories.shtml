      <h1>JMRI: Memory Variables Documentation</h1>
      A JMRI memory
      variable can hold any type of object. It's really up to user
      code what to put in them, and how to manipulate them.

      <h2>The Memory Variable Table</h2>
      The <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/MemoryTable.shtml">Memory
      Table</a> lets you see what Memories have been defined, and
      what value they currently contain. The table will ask the
      contents of each Memory to display itself, so an image or icon
      will show as a picture in the table; most other things will
      show as a string. You can type a new string value into a
      Memory.

      <h4>Memory Table controls</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Below the Memory Table you'll find the
          <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/MemoryAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
          button to add new Memories.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Using Memories with Logix</h2>
      A Logix can test a memory
      for particular contents, and set the contents of a Memory to
      whatever string is needed. This lets you use a Memory as a
      status indicator, counter or just about anything else you can
      imagine. Because of their user interface, Logix generally
      only put string values into Memory Variables.

      <h2>Displaying a Memory Variable on a Panel</h2>
      The contents
      of a Memory can be displayed on a <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelEditor.shtml">panel</a>.
      Usually, the Memory will try to display its contents
      directly. If the contents are an icon, image or string, the
      contents will be shown directly. As a special case, if the
      contents of the Memory are "null" (the memory contains no
      object), a red X icon is displayed. This lets you see and
      position the memory icon on the panel. If the Memory contains the
      zero-length string "", that's an object, and it will be
      displayed as blank space; a little hard to spot.

      <p>You can customize the appearance of text in the Memory icon via
      its pop-up menu.</p>

      <p>You can also define a series of icons to be displayed in
      place of the Memory's own contents if you'd like. For an
      example of how this is done, please see the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/xml/samples/MemoryIconExample.xml">sample
      XML file</a>. Use your browser's "view source" command, or
      download that file to see how it's done. Basically, the XML
      browser file has a "memoryicon" element that carries various
      information about where to put the icon, whether it can be
      selected, etc. Within that element, you can define
      "memorystate" elements that define what icon to show when the
      memory has a specific value:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
    &lt;memoryicon memory="IM20" defaulticon="program:resources/icons/misc/Question-black.gif"&gt;
      &lt;memorystate value="9" icon="program:resources/icons/misc/Nixie/M9B.gif" /&gt;
      &lt;memorystate value="8" icon="program:resources/icons/misc/Nixie/M8B.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/memoryicon&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>(That example has been simplified by omitting some stuff from
      the memoryicon element) In the example, the two memorystate
      elements ensure that if the Memory contains "9" or "8", certain
      images will be shown, otherwise a default black question mark icon
      will be shown.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, JMRI doesn't have a nice GUI tool for
      defining the icons displayed when using a memory icon this
      way. You have to edit the XML file by hand, following one of
      the examples.</p>

      <h3>Saving Blocks to disk</h3>

      <p>Memories are saved in your layout configuration file, along
      with Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads, etc. To store this
      information on disk, use <b>Store Configuration...</b> in the
      <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Memory Variable Table (or other
      tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b>
      in the <b>Panel</b> menu.</p>
