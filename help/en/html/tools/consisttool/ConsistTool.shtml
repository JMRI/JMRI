<h1>JMRI: Consisting Tool</h1>

<h2>What is a Consist?</h2>
	<p>
	There are three types of consists used on DCC systems:
	</p>
		<ol>
		<li>A <i>basic</i> or <i>primary address consist</i>.  In this 
		type of consist, each Locomotive is assigned the same address on 
		the programming track, or on the main with OpsMode Programming 
		(if supported by the command station and decoder). You can 
		use either a long (CV17 and CV18) or short (CV1) address for 
		a primary address consist.
		</li>
		<li> 
		<p>A <i>Command Station Assisted Consist</i> (CSAC).  A command 
		station assisted consist is built using a function of your 
		command station.</p>
		
		<p>Command Station Assisted Consists go by the trade names 
		listed in the table below.  The table also lists the known 
		limitations imposed by each manufacturer. 
		<table>
		<tr>
		<td>Manufacturer</td>
		   <td>Trade Name</td>
		   <td>Usage Notes</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		   <td>Digitrax</td>
		   <td>Universal Consist</td>
		   <td>Limited to number of slots supported by the system.  
		       Allows any address to be used.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		   <td>Lenz</td>
		   <td>Double Header</td>
		   <td>Limited to 2 Locomotives.  Allows any address but 
		       00 to be used.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		   <td>NCE</td>
		   <td>Old Style Consist</td>
		   <td>Limited to 8 Locomotives.  Allows any address but 
		       00 to be used.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		   <td>EasyDCC</td>
		   <td>Standard Consist</td>
		   <td>Limited to 8 Locomotives.  Allows any address but 
		       00 to be used.</td>
		<tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>
		The common trait shared by all versions of CSAC is 
		that a separate speed and direction command is sent 
		to the track for each Locomotive that is in the consist.
		</p>
		</li>
		
		<li> 
		<p>A <i>Decoder Assisted Consist</i> (DAC), Which is also 
		referred to frequently as an <i>Advanced Consist</i>.
		</p>  
		<p>
		The NMRA has set aside CV19 as a dedicated location for 
		consist addresses.
		</p>
		<p>
		If CV19 contains a value other than 0, the Locomotive will
		respond to speed and direction instructions on the 
		address in CV19.  Otherwise, it will respond to speed and 
		direction commands sent only on the usual short
		or long decoder address.
		</p>  
		<p>
		Since the consist address is a single CV, it is limited 
		to the range of 1 to 127.  If you add 128 to the consist 
		address, the Locomotive will run backwards (relative to
		it's normal direction of travel) in the consist.
		</p>
		<p>
		For most decoders, this type of consist can be by 
		programming operations in the same ways that a basic 
		Consist can be.  We say most here because some decoders 
		block writing to any address CV using operations mode 
		programming.  
		</p>
		<p>
		The NMRA has also set aside a special command to set up a
		Decoder Assisted Consist on the mainline.  This command 
		should be supported by all decoders that support Decoder 
		Assisted Consisting.
		</p>
		<p>
		The advantage to DAC, when compared to CSAC is that only 
		one speed and direction command is sent to the entire 
		consist.
		</p>
		<p>
		By default, Locomotives in a DAC ignore function commands 
		sent to the consist address.  You can configure some decoders 
		so they will respond to function commands issued to the 
		consist address as well (through CVs 21 and 22).  If 
		supported by the decoder, The appropriate values can also 
		be configured through DecoderPro using the Consisting Tab 
		in the comprehensive programmer.
		</p>
		<p>
		One final note, Advanced Consists operate in 28 speed steps
		(always).  You may need to make sure your throttle is 
		sending 28 speed steps to the address to avoid flickering 
		headlights.
		</p>
		</li>
		</ol>

	<h3>Consisting Support in JMRI</h3>
	<p>
	   JMRI provides support for consists using the consist tool, 
	   which is accessible through the tools menu of any JMRI 
	   application.
	   (There is also a 
	   <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/nce/consist/NceConsistEditFrame.shtml">NCE-specific consisting tool</a>
	   that works somewhat differently from the tool described here)
	</p>
	<p>
	   The Consisting tool provides a visual tool for manipulating the 
	Decoder Assisted Consists and, on some command stations, 
	Command Station Assisted Consists.  
	</p>
	<p>
	   Backing up the consist tool is a consist manager.  The consist 
	   manager is responsible for maintaining information about 
	   existing consists and for communicating the necessary 
	   information between the consist tool and the command station.
	</p>
	
	<b>Available JMRI Consist Managers</b>
	</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<p>
		      The <i>Generic Consist Manager</i> is used on any system 
		      which does not have it's own consist manager, but supports 
		      operations mode programming.  This manager is only 
		      able to manipulate Decoder Assisted Consists.
		   </p>
		   <p>
		      <i>The Generic Consist Manager bypasses any routines the 
		      command station has to set the consist address.</i>  The 
		      importance of this is that IF your command station provides a 
		      method for you to run a consist by selecting a Locomotive by 
		      it's address, this won't function.  You'll need to use the 
		      short address identifier you selected for the consist ID to 
		      control the consist speed and direction.
		   </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		   <p>
		  The <i>XPressNet Consist Manager</i> uses support provided 
		      by XPressNet Based systems to manipulate consists.  This 
		      consist manager is able to construct a Lenz "Double Header" 
		      in addition to Advanced Consists.
		   </p>
		   <p>
		      Since this consist manager uses the consist creation 
		      instructions provided by the XPressNet protocol, the Lenz 
		      <i>Smart Consisting</i> feature works with consists created 
		      by the tool.  On Lenz systems, <i>Smart Consisting</i> 
		      refers to the ability to be able to run a consist from <i>any</i> 
		      of the consisted Locomotive addresses or from the consist 
		      address.
		   </p>
		   <p>
		      The XPressNet Consist Manager is capable of reading consist 
		      information from the command station, both for Advanced Consists 
		      and Lenz Double Headers.  
		   </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		   <p>
		  The <i>EasyDCC Consist Manager</i> uses support provided 
		      by CVP's EasyDCC system to manipulate consists.  This 
		      consist manager is able to construct EasyDCC "Standard Consists" 
		      in addition to Advanced Consists.
		   </p>
		   <p>
		      CVP does not provide a method to construct Advanced Consists.  
		      As a result, advanced consists are created by bypassing the 
		      command station.  Unlike the Generic Consist Manager, the 
		      EasyDCC Consist Manager creates these by issuing a Consist 
		      Control packet to the track.  This allows inclusion of 
		      Locomotives that do not permit writing CV19 using 
		      operations mode programming.  As with the Generic Consist 
		      Manager, you must use the short address selected as the consist 
		      address to control the consist.
		   <p>
		      For EasyDCC Standard Consists, there are a couple of restrictions
		      imposed by the EasyDCC Protocol.  First, as with consists created 
		      on the command station directly, consists are limited to 8 
		      addresses.  Second, unlike consists created on the command station 
		      directly, CVP limits the standard consist address to addresses 
		      between 1 and 255.
		   </p>
		   <p>
		      The EasyDCC Consist Manager will read Standard Consist information
		      for consists in the allowed range (1-255) from the command 
		      station's memory.  Since the command station is bypassed to create
		      Advanced Consists, these cannot be read from the command station.
		</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Using the Consist Tool</h2></a>
	<p>
	When you first open the consist tool, you will see a screen similar to the following:
	</p>
	<image src=images/ConsistTool.jpg alt="Blank Consist Tool">
	<p>
	on the top row are used to select between an Advanced (or 
	   Decoder Assisted) Consist and a Command Station Assisted 
	   Consist.  If the Command Station Assisted Consists are not 
	   supported by the tool for your system, these selections will be 
	   grayed out.
	</p>
	<p>
	   The box Next to the label <b>Consist:</b> is used to specify the 
	   consist ID.  For Decoder Assisted Consists, this should be the 
	   short address used to identify the consist.  For Command 
	   Station Assisted Consists, this value may automatically be 
	   filled in with the lead Locomotive address when you try to add 
	   it to the consist.
	</p>
	<p>
	   Adding a typical ID for a Decoder Assisted Consist should look 
	   like the following:
	</p>
	<image src=images/ConsistTool-IDAdded.jpg alt="Consist Tool - ID Added">
	<p>
	The second line of the consisting tool is used to add Locomotives.
	   A Locomotive may be added either by entering it's number in the 
	   box next to <b>New Locomotive</b> or by selecting it's number 
	   from the roster drop down box.
	</p>
	   <image src=images/ConsistTool-LeadLoco.jpg alt="Lead Locomotive Selected">
	<p>
	  Clicking the <b>add</b> button will add a Locomotive to the 
	  consist, and it will appear in the list below the second line.
	</p>
	  <image src=images/ConsistTool-LeadLocoAdded.jpg alt="Lead Locomotive Added to Consist">
	<p>
	  Clicking the <b>reset</b> button will clear the information for 
	  this Locomotive.
	</p>
	<p>
	   The <b>Direction Normal</b> checkbox is used to determine if 
	   the Locomotive is traveling in forward or reverse when the 
	   consist is traveling forward.
	</p>
	<p>
	   You may notice from the previous screen shots that this box is 
	   grayed out until a lead Locomotive is selected.  With 
	   subsequent Locomotives, you can check this box to indicate the
	   direction of the Locomotive relative to the lead Locomotive.
	</p>
	   <image src=images/ConsistTool-SecondLoco.jpg alt="Second Locomotive Selected - Direction Reversed">
	<p>
	   After adding the second Locomotive to the consist, with the
	   direction reversed, you should see something like the following:
	</p>
	   <image src=images/ConsistTool-SecondLocoAdded.jpg alt="Second Locomotive Added">
	<p>
	   If you made a mistake, and add a second Locomotive to the 
	   consist with the wrong direction, you can change it's direction 
	   simply by clicking on the checkbox in the Direction Normal column.
	</p>
	   <image src=images/ConsistTool-SecondLocoDirChange.jpg alt="Second Locomotive - Direction Change">
	<p>
	   The direction of the lead Locomotive cannot be changed once 
	   added.
	</p>
	<p>
	   To delete an individual Locomotive from the consist, you can
	   select the <b>Del</b> button in the right most column of the 
	   appropriate row of the table of addresses.
	</p>
	<p>
	   To delete an entire consist you can use the <b>Delete</b> 
	   button at the bottom of the screen.
	</p>
	<p>
	   The throttle button at the bottom of the screen can be used to
	   bring up a JMRI throttle for this address.
	</p>
	<p>
	   To Add a new consist, you can select the blank entry in the 
	   drop-down box next to the current consist's ID.
	</p>
	<image src=images/ConsistTool-NewConsist.jpg alt="Select New Consist">
	<p>
	   To Recall an existing consist, you can select the appropriate 
	   entry from the drop-down box next to the current consist's ID.
