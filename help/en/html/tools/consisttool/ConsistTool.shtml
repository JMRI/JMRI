      <h1>JMRI: Consisting Tool</h1>

      <h2>What is a Consist?</h2>

      <p>There are three types of consists used on DCC systems:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>A <em>basic</em> or <em>primary address consist</em>.
          <p>In this type of consist, each Locomotive is assigned the same address on the
          programming track, or on the main with OpsMode Programming (if supported by the command
          station and decoder). You can use either a long (CV17 and CV18) or short (CV1) address
          for a primary address consist.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A <em>Command Station Assisted Consist</em> (CSAC).</p>

          <p>A command station assisted consist is built using a function of your command
          station.<br>
          Command Station Assisted Consists go by the trade names listed in the table below. The
          table also lists the known limitations imposed by each manufacturer.</p>

          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Manufacturer</th>
              <th>Trade Name</th>
              <th>Usage Notes</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Digitrax</td>
              <td>Universal Consist</td>
              <td>Limited to number of slots supported by the system.</td>
              <td>Allows any address to be used.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Lenz</td>
              <td>Double Header</td>
              <td>Limited to 2 Locomotives</td>
              <td>Allows any address but 00 to be used.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>NCE</td>
              <td>Old Style Consist</td>
              <td>Limited to 8 Locomotives</td>
              <td>Allows any address but 00 to be used.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>EasyDCC</td>
              <td>Standard Consist</td>
              <td>Limited to 8 Locomotives</td>
              <td>Allows any address but 00 to be used.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>The common trait shared by all versions of CSAC is that a separate speed and direction
          command is sent to the track for each Locomotive that is in the consist.</p>
        </li>

        <li>A <em>Decoder Assisted Consist</em> (DAC), also referred to frequently as an
        <em>Advanced Consist</em>.<br>
        The NMRA has set aside CV19 as a dedicated location for consist addresses.<br>
        If CV19 contains a value other than 0, the Locomotive will respond to speed and direction
        instructions on the address in CV19. Otherwise, it will respond to speed and direction
        commands sent only on the usual short or long decoder address.<br>
        Since the consist address is a single CV, it is limited to the range of 1 to 127. If you
        add 128 to the consist address, the Locomotive will run backwards (relative to it's normal
        direction of travel) in the consist.<br>
        For most decoders, this type of consist can be by programming operations in the same ways
        that a basic Consist can be. We say most here because some decoders block writing to any
        address CV using operations mode programming.<br>
        The NMRA has also set aside a special command to set up a Decoder Assisted Consist on the
        mainline. This command should be supported by all decoders that support Decoder Assisted
        Consisting.<br>
        The advantage to DAC, when compared to CSAC is that only one speed and direction command is
        sent to the entire consist.<br>
        By default, Locomotives in a DAC ignore function commands sent to the consist address. You
        can configure some decoders so they will respond to function commands issued to the consist
        address as well (through CVs 21 and 22). If supported by the decoder, The appropriate
        values can also be configured through DecoderPro using the Consisting Tab in the
        comprehensive programmer.<br>
        One final note: Advanced Consists operate in 28 speed steps (always). You may need to make
        sure your throttle is sending 28 speed steps to the address to avoid flickering
        headlights.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Consisting Support in JMRI</h3>

      <p>JMRI provides support for consists using the Consist Tool, which is accessible through the
      Tools or Actions menu of any JMRI application. (There is also a <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/nce/consist/NceConsistEditFrame.shtml">NCE-specific Consisting
      Tool</a> that works somewhat differently from the tool described here)</p>

      <p>The Consisting tool provides a visual tool for manipulating the Decoder Assisted Consists
      and, on some command stations, Command Station Assisted Consists.<br>
      Backing up the Consist Tool is a consist manager. The consist manager is responsible for
      maintaining information about existing consists and for communicating the necessary
      information between the consist tool and the Command Station.</p>

      <h4>Available JMRI Consist Managers</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>The <em>Generic Consist Managers</em> are used on any system which does not have it's
        own consist manager, but supports either operations mode programming or a sending raw DCC
        packets.<br>
        There are two generic consist managers, one uses operations mode programming to change
        CV19, and the other sends a special DCC packet to change CV19. Which version is used is
        dependent on the support the associated system provides, and is not user selectable.<br>
        The Generic Consist Managers only able to manipulate Decoder Assisted Consists.<br>
        <em>The Generic Consist Manager bypasses any routines the command station has to set the
        consist address.</em> The importance of this is that IF your command station provides a
        method for you to run a consist by selecting a Locomotive by it's address, this won't
        function. You'll need to use the short address identifier you selected for the consist ID
        to control the consist speed and direction.</li>

        <li>The <em>XPressNet Consist Manager</em> uses support provided by XPressNet Based systems
        to manipulate consists. This consist manager is able to construct a Lenz "Double Header" in
        addition to Advanced Consists.<br>
        Since this consist manager uses the consist creation instructions provided by the XPressNet
        protocol, the Lenz <em>Smart Consisting</em> feature works with consists created by the
        tool. On Lenz systems, <em>Smart Consisting</em> refers to the ability to be able to run a
        consist from <em>any</em> of the consisted Locomotive addresses or from the consist
        address.<br>
        The XPressNet Consist Manager is capable of reading consist information from the command
        station, both for Advanced Consists and Lenz Double Headers.</li>

        <li>The <em>EasyDCC Consist Manager</em> uses support provided by CVP's EasyDCC system to
        manipulate consists. This consist manager is able to construct EasyDCC "Standard Consists"
        in addition to Advanced Consists.<br>
        CVP does not provide a method to construct Advanced Consists. As a result, advanced
        consists are created by bypassing the command station. Unlike the Generic Consist Manager,
        the EasyDCC Consist Manager creates these by issuing a Consist Control packet to the track.
        This allows inclusion of Locomotives that do not permit writing CV19 using operations mode
        programming. As with the Generic Consist Manager, you must use the short address selected
        as the consist address to control the consist.<br>
        For EasyDCC Standard Consists, there are a couple of restrictions imposed by the EasyDCC
        Protocol. First, as with consists created on the command station directly, consists are
        limited to 8 addresses. Second, unlike consists created on the command station directly,
        CVP limits the standard consist address to addresses between 1 and 255.<br>
        The EasyDCC Consist Manager will read Standard Consist information for consists in the
        allowed range (1-255) from the command station's memory. Since the command station is
        bypassed to create Advanced Consists, these cannot be read from the command station.</li>

        <li>The <em>Internal Consist Manager</em> is a special consist manager associated with the
        Internal JMRI system. It functions like the <em>Generic Consist Managers</em>, but it is a
        available as a user selectable option so that users can choose to bypass a system specific
        consist manager.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Selecting a Consist Manager</h4>

      <p>To select the consist manager in use, we first need to open the defaults tab in the
      preferences.</p>
      <img src="images/Preferences-ConsistManagerSelection-Annotated.png" alt=
      "Annotated User Preferences window">
      <p>Once the preferences are loaded, the choices for the consist manager will be selectable in
      the "Consists" column (inside the box labeled 1 in the figure above). Here we see two
      choices, one for a LocoNet connection, labeled A and one for the Internal connection labeled
      B.<br>
      If you have more system connections available, other options may be available as well.</p>

      <p>If you choose option A, then you choose to use the consist manager associated with the
      system. This will either be a system specific consist manager or one of the generic consist
      managers, depending on the support of the system.</p>

      <p>If you choose option B, then the <em>Internal Consist Manager</em> manager is used. In
      this case, if there is a selection made in the Command Station column (in the box labeled 2
      in the figure) then the consist will be created on the system with the selected command
      station. This selection will cause consists to be created using a special DCC packet for
      creating consists.</p>

      <p>If you choose option B and there is no selection for the command station, consists will be
      created on the system with an Ops Mode Programmer selected in Column 3. This selection will
      cause consists to be created using Operations Mode Programming. Note that if the Internal
      system is selected in this case, no consists will be created.</p>

      <h4>Consists and the JMRI Roster</h4>

      <p>JMRI users sometimes create Advanced Consists using the programmer to set the value of
      CV19. Begining with JMRI Version 4.17.3, the JMRI consisting tools provide some tools to
      synchronize the advanced consists created by programming with those of the advanced</p>

      <h5>Import From Roster</h5>

      <p>Users can import consists created with the programmer into the Consist Manager by
      selecting the <em>Scan Roster for Consists</em> option in the Consist Control's <em>File</em>
      menu.</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-ScanForConsists.png" alt=
      "The Scan For Consists Option is a Choice in the Consist Control Window's file Menu">
      <p>Once the scan completes, any consists discovered will be added to the list of consists
      available to the Consist Control. Please note that this tool does not write the consists to
      the DCC system.</p>

      <h5>Keeping the Roster Synchronized</h5>

      <p>Users may choose to have JMRI update consist information in their roster when creating and
      removing locomotives from Advanced Consists. This optin is activated by checking the
      <em>Update CV19 in roster when modifying advanced consists</em> box in the <em>Consist
      Control</em> section of the JMRI preferences.</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistControl-Preferences.png" alt="Preferences for the Consist Control">
      <p>Selecting this option may cause a performance impact when modifying rosters, due to
      reading and writing the roster file. This option is disabled by default.</p>

      <h2 id="tool">Using the Consist Tool</h2>

      <p>You find this tool</p>

      <ul>
        <li>in DecoderPro: in the Actions menu</li>

        <li>in PanelPro: in the Tools menu</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When you first open the Consist Tool, you will see a screen similar to the following:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool.png" alt="Blank Consist Tool" height="251" width="725">
      <p>The radio buttons in the top row are used to select between an Advanced (or Decoder
      Assisted) Consist and a Command Station Assisted Consist. If the Command Station Assisted
      Consists are not supported by the tool for your system, these selections will be grayed
      out.</p>

      <p>The box next to the label <strong>Consist:</strong> lets you enter the Consist ID. For
      <em>Decoder Assisted Consists</em>, this should be the short address used to identify the
      consist. For Command Station Assisted Consists, this value may automatically be filled in
      with the lead Locomotive address when you try to add it to the consist.<br>
      To specify how you wish to use an address from 1 to 127 (excluding 3) that can be either
      short or long, use the drop down list next to the Consist text field to select your
      choice:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-AddressType.png" alt="Consist Tool - ID Added" height="74"
      width="235">
      <p>Setting a typical ID for a Decoder Assisted Consist should now look like the
      following:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-IDAdded.png" alt="Consist Tool - ID Added" height="75" width=
      "726">
      <p>The second line of the consisting tool is used to add Locomotives to your Consist. A
      Locomotive may be added either by entering it's number in the box next to <strong>New
      Locomotive</strong>:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-LeadLoco.png" alt="Type in Lead Locomotive Address" height="60"
      width="722">
      <p>or by selecting it's number from the roster drop down box:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-PickLoco.png" alt="Select Lead Locomotive" height="77" width=
      "725">
      <p>Clicking the <strong>Add</strong> button will add the Locomotive to the Consist, and it
      will appear in the list below the second line:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-LeadLocoAdded.png" alt="Lead Locomotive Added to Consist"
      height="72" width="723">
      <p>Clicking the <strong>Reset</strong> button will clear the information on the New Loco
      entry line.</p>

      <p><img src="images/ConsistTool-Reverse1.png" alt="Direction Normal (or reversed) check box"
      height="125" width="457" class="floatRight"> The <strong>Direction Normal</strong> checkbox
      allows the user to specify if the new Locomotive is traveling in Forward or Reverse when the
      Consist is traveling Forward.<br>
      You may notice from the previous screen shots that this box is grayed out until a lead
      Locomotive is selected. When adding subsequent Locomotives, you can (un)check this box to
      indicate the direction of each new Locomotive relative to the lead Locomotive.<br>
      After adding a second Locomotive to the consist, with the direction reversed, you should see
      something like the following:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-SecondLocoAdded.png" alt="Second Locomotive Added" height="251"
      width="726">
      <p>If you made a mistake, and add a second Locomotive to the Consist with the wrong direction
      set, you can change it's direction simply by clicking on the checkbox in the Direction Normal
      column.<br>
      The direction of the first (lead) Locomotive cannot be changed once added.</p>

      <p>To delete an individual Locomotive from the consist, you can select the
      <strong>Delete</strong> button in the right most column of the appropriate row of the table
      of addresses.</p>

      <p>To delete an entire Consist you can use the <strong>Delete</strong> button at the bottom
      of the screen.</p>

      <p>The Throttle button at the bottom of the screen can be used to bring up a JMRI throttle
      for this Consist address.</p>

      <p>To add a new Consist, select the first, blank entry in the drop-down box next to the
      current consist's ID:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-NewConsist.png" alt="Select New Consist" height="82" width=
      "364">
      <p>To recall an existing Consist for inspection, select the appropriate entry from the
      drop-down box next to the current Consist's ID:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-SelectConsist.png" alt="Select a Consist" height="83" width=
      "353"> <!--#include virtual="/Footer.shtml" -->


      <h2 id="track">Keeping Track of Consists</h2>

        If you'd like, you can track your consists in a new column in the DecoderPro
        listing. To do this, you create the column, then manually enter the
        consist information (There is no automatic population of this column
        DecoderPro can't keep track of all the various methods of consisting;
        we want to avoid user confusion when automatic updates show invalid info)
        <p>
        To do this:
        <ol>
        <li>Select a locomotive
        <li>Under the Action menu, select Labels and Media
        <li>On that window, select Roster Media
        <li>In the lower half of the window, enter "Consist Info" over the three dots (&hellip;)
            in the Name column, and your value over the three dots in the Value column.
        <li>Hit Return, and then click &ldquo;Save to Roster&rdquo;
        <li>Close the window.
        <li>The first time you do this, quit and restart JMRI (it would be nice if this
            wasn&rsquo;t necessary, but right now it often is)
        <li>On the main roster, right-click or ctrl-click on the heading in any column.
            Select your new Consist Info entry to put a checkmark next to it.
            A new column should appear titled Consist Info and showing the value you
            entered on that locomotive.
            Ctrl-drag on the heading to move the column to where you want it.
        <li>Now that it&rsquo;s set up, you can click on a cell in that column to enter the
            your value for any locomotive. DecoderPro will keep the info from one
            run to another in the roster.
        </ol>
