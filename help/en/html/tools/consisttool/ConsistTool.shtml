	<h1>JMRI: Consisting Tool</h1>

	<h2>What is a Consist?</h2>
	<p>
	There are three types of consists used on DCC systems:
	</p>
		<ol>
		<li>A <i>basic</i> or <i>primary address consist</i>.
		<p>In this
		type of consist, each Locomotive is assigned the same address on 
		the programming track, or on the main with OpsMode Programming 
		(if supported by the command station and decoder). You can 
		use either a long (CV17 and CV18) or short (CV1) address for 
		a primary address consist.
		</li>
		<li> 
		<p>A <i>Command Station Assisted Consist</i> (CSAC).
		<p>A command
		station assisted consist is built using a function of your 
		command station.<br>
		Command Station Assisted Consists go by the trade names
		listed in the table below.  The table also lists the known 
		limitations imposed by each manufacturer.
		</p>
		<table>
		<tr>
		<th>Manufacturer</th>
		   <th>Trade Name</th>
		   <th>Usage Notes</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		   <td>Digitrax</td>
		   <td>Universal Consist</td>
		   <td>Limited to number of slots supported by the system.</td>
			<td>Allows any address to be used.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		   <td>Lenz</td>
		   <td>Double Header</td>
		   <td>Limited to 2 Locomotives</td>
			<td>Allows any address but
		       00 to be used.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		   <td>NCE</td>
		   <td>Old Style Consist</td>
		   <td>Limited to 8 Locomotives</td>
			<td>Allows any address but
		       00 to be used.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		   <td>EasyDCC</td>
		   <td>Standard Consist</td>
		   <td>Limited to 8 Locomotives</td>
			<td>Allows any address but
		       00 to be used.</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>
		The common trait shared by all versions of CSAC is 
		that a separate speed and direction command is sent 
		to the track for each Locomotive that is in the consist.
		</p>
		</li>
		
		<li> 
		A <i>Decoder Assisted Consist</i> (DAC), also
		referred to frequently as an <i>Advanced Consist</i>.
		<br>
		The NMRA has set aside CV19 as a dedicated location for 
		consist addresses.
		<br>
		If CV19 contains a value other than 0, the Locomotive will
		respond to speed and direction instructions on the 
		address in CV19.  Otherwise, it will respond to speed and 
		direction commands sent only on the usual short
		or long decoder address.
		<br>
		Since the consist address is a single CV, it is limited 
		to the range of 1 to 127.  If you add 128 to the consist 
		address, the Locomotive will run backwards (relative to
		it's normal direction of travel) in the consist.
		<br>
		For most decoders, this type of consist can be by 
		programming operations in the same ways that a basic 
		Consist can be.  We say most here because some decoders 
		block writing to any address CV using operations mode 
		programming.  
		<br>
		The NMRA has also set aside a special command to set up a
		Decoder Assisted Consist on the mainline.  This command 
		should be supported by all decoders that support Decoder 
		Assisted Consisting.
		<br>
		The advantage to DAC, when compared to CSAC is that only 
		one speed and direction command is sent to the entire 
		consist.
		<br>
		By default, Locomotives in a DAC ignore function commands 
		sent to the consist address.  You can configure some decoders 
		so they will respond to function commands issued to the 
		consist address as well (through CVs 21 and 22).  If 
		supported by the decoder, The appropriate values can also 
		be configured through DecoderPro using the Consisting Tab 
		in the comprehensive programmer.
		<br>
		One final note: Advanced Consists operate in 28 speed steps
		(always).  You may need to make sure your throttle is 
		sending 28 speed steps to the address to avoid flickering 
		headlights.
		</li>
		</ol>

	<h3>Consisting Support in JMRI</h3>
	<p>
	   JMRI provides support for consists using the Consist Tool,
	   which is accessible through the Tools or Actions menu of any JMRI
	   application.
	   (There is also a 
	   <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/nce/consist/NceConsistEditFrame.shtml">NCE-specific Consisting Tool</a>
	   that works somewhat differently from the tool described here)
	</p>
	<p>
	   The Consisting tool provides a visual tool for manipulating the 
	Decoder Assisted Consists and, on some command stations, 
	Command Station Assisted Consists.  
	<br>
	   Backing up the Consist Tool is a consist manager.  The consist
	   manager is responsible for maintaining information about 
	   existing consists and for communicating the necessary 
	   information between the consist tool and the Command Station.
	</p>

	<h4>Available JMRI Consist Managers</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>
		      The <i>Generic Consist Managers</i> are used on any system 
		      which does not have it's own consist manager, but supports 
		      either operations mode programming or a sending raw DCC 
                      packets.

                    <br>
                      There are two generic consist managers, one uses
                      operations mode programming to change CV19, and the 
                      other sends a special DCC packet to change CV19.  Which 
                      version is used is dependent on the support the 
                      associated system provides, and is not user selectable.

                   <br>
                      The Generic Consist Managers only 
		      able to manipulate Decoder Assisted Consists.

		   <br>
		      <i>The Generic Consist Manager bypasses any routines the 
		      command station has to set the consist address.</i>  The 
		      importance of this is that IF your command station provides a 
		      method for you to run a consist by selecting a Locomotive by 
		      it's address, this won't function.  You'll need to use the 
		      short address identifier you selected for the consist ID to 
		      control the consist speed and direction.
		</li>
		<li>
		  The <i>XPressNet Consist Manager</i> uses support provided 
		      by XPressNet Based systems to manipulate consists.  This 
		      consist manager is able to construct a Lenz "Double Header" 
		      in addition to Advanced Consists.
		   <br>
		      Since this consist manager uses the consist creation 
		      instructions provided by the XPressNet protocol, the Lenz 
		      <i>Smart Consisting</i> feature works with consists created 
		      by the tool.  On Lenz systems, <i>Smart Consisting</i> 
		      refers to the ability to be able to run a consist from <i>any</i> 
		      of the consisted Locomotive addresses or from the consist 
		      address.
		   <br>
		      The XPressNet Consist Manager is capable of reading consist 
		      information from the command station, both for Advanced Consists 
		      and Lenz Double Headers.
		</li>
		<li>
		  The <i>EasyDCC Consist Manager</i> uses support provided 
		      by CVP's EasyDCC system to manipulate consists.  This 
		      consist manager is able to construct EasyDCC "Standard Consists" 
		      in addition to Advanced Consists.
		   <br>
		      CVP does not provide a method to construct Advanced Consists.  
		      As a result, advanced consists are created by bypassing the 
		      command station.  Unlike the Generic Consist Manager, the 
		      EasyDCC Consist Manager creates these by issuing a Consist 
		      Control packet to the track.  This allows inclusion of 
		      Locomotives that do not permit writing CV19 using 
		      operations mode programming.  As with the Generic Consist 
		      Manager, you must use the short address selected as the consist 
		      address to control the consist.
		   <br>
		      For EasyDCC Standard Consists, there are a couple of restrictions
		      imposed by the EasyDCC Protocol.  First, as with consists created 
		      on the command station directly, consists are limited to 8 
		      addresses.  Second, unlike consists created on the command station 
		      directly, CVP limits the standard consist address to addresses 
		      between 1 and 255.
		   <br>
		      The EasyDCC Consist Manager will read Standard Consist information
		      for consists in the allowed range (1-255) from the command 
		      station's memory.  Since the command station is bypassed to create
		      Advanced Consists, these cannot be read from the command station.
		</li>
                <li>
		      The <i>Internal Consist Manager</i> is a special consist 
                      manager associated with the Internal JMRI system.  It 
                      functions like the <i>Generic Consist Managers</i>, but 
                      it is a available as a user selectable option so that 
                      users can choose to bypass a system specific consist 
                      manager.
                </li>
		</ul>

	<h4>Selecting a Consist Manager</h4>

        <p>
        To select the consist manager in use, we first need to open the defaults tab in the preferences. 
        </p>

	<img src="images/Preferences-ConsistManagerSelection-Annotated.png" alt="Annotated User Preferences window" />

        <p>
        Once the preferences are loaded, the choices for the consist manager will be selectable in the "Consists" column
		(inside the box labeled 1 in the figure above).  Here we see two choices, one for a LocoNet connection, labeled A
		and one for the Internal connection labeled B.<br>
		If you have more system connections available, other options may be available as well.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you choose option A, then you choose to use the consist manager 
        associated with the system.  This will either be a system specific
        consist manager or one of the generic consist managers, depending
        on the support of the system.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        If you choose option B, then the <i>Internal Consist Manager</i> 
        manager is used.  In this case, if there is a selection made in the 
        Command Station column (in the box labeled 2 in the figure) then the
        consist will be created on the system with the selected command station.
        This selection will cause consists to be created using a special DCC 
        packet for creating consists.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you choose option B and there is no selection for the command station,
        consists will be created on the system with an Ops Mode Programmer 
        selected in Column 3.  This selection will cause consists to be created
        using Operations Mode Programming.  Note that if the Internal system 
        is selected in this case, no consists will be created.
        </p>

	<h4>Consists and the JMRI Roster</h4>

        <p>
        JMRI users sometimes create Advanced Consists using the programmer to 
        set the value of CV19.  Begining with JMRI Version 4.17.3, the JMRI 
        consisting tools provide some tools to synchronize the advanced 
        consists created by programming with those of the  advanced 
        </p>

        <h5>Import From Roster</h5>

        <p>
        Users can import consists created with the programmer into the 
        Consist Manager by selecting the <i>Scan Roster for Consists</i> 
        option in the Consist Control's <i>File</i> menu.
        </p>

	    <img src="images/ConsistTool-ScanForConsists.png" alt="The Scan For Consists Option is a Choice in the Consist Control Window's file Menu" />

        <p>
        Once the scan completes, any consists discovered will be added to the 
        list of consists available to the Consist Control.  Please note that 
        this tool does not write the consists to the DCC system.
        </p>

        <h5>Keeping the Roster Synchronized</h5>
        <p>
        Users may choose to have JMRI update consist information in their roster
        when creating and removing locomotives from Advanced Consists.  This 
        optin is activated by checking the <i>Update CV19 in roster when 
        modifying advanced consists</i> box in the <i>Consist Control</i> 
        section of the JMRI preferences.
        </p>

	    <img src="images/ConsistControl-Preferences.png" alt="Preferences for the Consist Control" />

        <p>
        Selecting this option may cause a performance impact when modifying 
        rosters, due to reading and writing the roster file.  This option is
        disabled by default.
        </p>

	<a name="tool" id="tool">
	</a><h2>Using the Consist Tool</h2>
	<p>
	You find this tool
	<ul>
		<li>in DecoderPro: in the Actions menu</li>
		<li>in PanelPro: in the Tools menu</li>
	</ul>

	<p>When you first open the Consist Tool, you will see a screen similar to the following:
	</p>

	<img src="images/ConsistTool.png" alt="Blank Consist Tool"
		 height="251" width="725"/>
	<p>
	The radio buttons in the top row are used to select between an Advanced (or
	   Decoder Assisted) Consist and a Command Station Assisted 
	   Consist. If the Command Station Assisted Consists are not
	   supported by the tool for your system, these selections will be 
	   grayed out.
	</p>
	<p>
	   The box next to the label <b>Consist:</b> lets you enter the
		Consist ID.  For <i>Decoder Assisted Consists</i>, this should be the
	   short address used to identify the consist.  For Command 
	   Station Assisted Consists, this value may automatically be 
	   filled in with the lead Locomotive address when you try to add 
	   it to the consist.
		<br>
		To specify how you wish to use an address from 1 to 127
		(excluding 3) that can be either short or long, use the drop down list
		next to the Consist text field to select your choice:
	</p>
		<img src="images/ConsistTool-AddressType.png" alt="Consist Tool - ID Added"
			 height="74" width="235"/>
	<p>
	   Setting a typical ID for a Decoder Assisted Consist should now look
	   like the following:
	</p>
	<img src="images/ConsistTool-IDAdded.png" alt="Consist Tool - ID Added"
		 height="75" width="726"/>
	<p>
	The second line of the consisting tool is used to add Locomotives
		to your Consist.
	   A Locomotive may be added either by entering it's number in the 
	   box next to <b>New Locomotive</b>:
	</p>
	   <img src="images/ConsistTool-LeadLoco.png" alt="Type in Lead Locomotive Address"
			height="60" width="722"/>
	<p>or by selecting it's number from the roster drop down box:
	</p>
		<img src="images/ConsistTool-PickLoco.png" alt="Select Lead Locomotive"
			 height="77" width="725"/>
	<p>
	  Clicking the <b>Add</b> button will add the Locomotive to the
	  Consist, and it will appear in the list below the second line:
	</p>
	  <img src="images/ConsistTool-LeadLocoAdded.png" alt="Lead Locomotive Added to Consist"
		   height="72" width="723"/>
	<p>
	  Clicking the <b>Reset</b> button will clear the information on the New Loco entry line.
	</p>
	<p>
	   <img src="images/ConsistTool-Reverse1.png" alt="Direction Normal (or reversed) check box"
		height="125" width="457" align="right">
	   The <b>Direction Normal</b> checkbox allows the user to specify if
	   the new Locomotive is traveling in Forward or Reverse when the
	   Consist is traveling Forward.
	<br>
	   You may notice from the previous screen shots that this box is 
	   grayed out until a lead Locomotive is selected.  When adding
	   subsequent Locomotives, you can (un)check this box to indicate the
	   direction of each new Locomotive relative to the lead Locomotive.
	<br>
	   After adding a second Locomotive to the consist, with the
	   direction reversed, you should see something like the following:
	</p>
	   <img src="images/ConsistTool-SecondLocoAdded.png" alt="Second Locomotive Added"
			height="251" width="726"/>
	<p>
	   If you made a mistake, and add a second Locomotive to the 
	   Consist with the wrong direction set, you can change it's direction
	   simply by clicking on the checkbox in the Direction Normal column.
	<br>
	   The direction of the first (lead) Locomotive cannot be changed once
	   added.
	</p>
	<p>
	   To delete an individual Locomotive from the consist, you can
	   select the <b>Delete</b> button in the right most column of the
	   appropriate row of the table of addresses.
	</p>
	<p>
	   To delete an entire Consist you can use the <b>Delete</b>
	   button at the bottom of the screen.
	</p>
	<p>
	   The Throttle button at the bottom of the screen can be used to
	   bring up a JMRI throttle for this Consist address.
	</p>
	<p>
	   To add a new Consist, select the first, blank entry in the
	   drop-down box next to the current consist's ID:
	</p>
	<img src="images/ConsistTool-NewConsist.png" alt="Select New Consist"
		 height="82" width="364"/>
	<p>
	   To recall an existing Consist for inspection, select the appropriate
	   entry from the drop-down box next to the current Consist's ID:
