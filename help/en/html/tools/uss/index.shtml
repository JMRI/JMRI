      <h2>JMRI: Utility USS CTC Tools</h2>

      <p class="example">This is the original implementation of CTC and provides capabilities that
      are enabled using scripting. See also <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/ctc/CTC.shtml">the
      newer CTC implementation</a> that provides a GUI editor to configure the CTC rules and a
      run-time to implement CTC logic. It also builds a skeleton Panel Editor CTC panel with the
      turnout levers/indicators, signal levers/indicators, code button, etc., and a minimal track
      plan.</p>

      <p>JMRI contains tools to help in the automation of USS CTC Panels. These can be used for
      either screen-based Panels, or to drive a physical panel with real levers and lights.</p>

      <h3>Script-based Tools<span class="since">Since JMRI 4.8</span></h3>

      <p>These tools are very powerful, but currently can only be configured via a script.<br>
      For information how to do this, see:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <a href=
        "https://jmri.org/jython/ctc/TwoColumnMachine.py">jython/ctc/TwoColumnMachine.py</a> sample
        script
        </li>

        <li>The <a href=
        "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/package-summary.html">Javadoc documentation
        on the various components</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      The available tools are:
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/CodeLine.html">Code Line</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Implements the code line between the CTC machine and the field. Can use a turnout
        output to tell e.g. a lamp to light or relays to make noise.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/Station.html">Station</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Corresponds to a single station on the code line, usually a single column on the CTC
        machine and all the items in the field that are connected to it.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/CodeButton.html">Code Button</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>One per section, this defines the connection to the code button (a sensor input) and
        the code lamp (a turnout output) on the panel.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/TurnoutSection.html">Turnout
          Section</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Controls a single turnout in the field. You configure it with that turnout's name along
        with sensor inputs for the lever on the panel, and turnout outputs for the indicator lamps.
        Can optionally take Lock objects to add prototypical locking.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href=
          "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/SignalHeadSection.html">SignalHead
          Section</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Controls the signal heads around a single OS in the field. You configure it with lists
        of left-going and right-going heads which it can hold and release, along with sensor inputs
        for the lever on the panel, and turnout outputs for the indicator lamps. Can optionally
        take Lock objects to add prototypical locking.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/TrackCircuitSection.html">Track
          Circuit Section</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>This drives a track occupancy indicator lamp (an output) on the panel from a occupancy
        sensor in the field (a sensor input). Optionally, can ring a bell when goes occupied or
        unoccupied.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href=
          "https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/MaintainerCallSection.html">Maintainer
          Call Section</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>This drives a maintainer call lamp (an output) in the field from a lever or switch on
        the central panel (a sensor input).</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/OccupancyLock.html">Occupancy
          Lock</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>When added to a Turnout or SignalHead section, this prevents changes while the OS
        section (defined into the Lock) is occupied.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/RouteLock.html">Route Lock</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>When added to a Turnout section, this prevents changes while the OS section has a route
        cleared through the Turnout.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/TimeLock.html">Time Lock</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>When added to a Turnout section, this prevents changes while the OS section has signals
        running time.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/TrafficLock.html">Traffic
          Lock</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Locks against signals being cleared in opposite directions onto a single segment of
        track. Can be configured with turnout settings (BeanSetting objects) to allow e.g. signals
        at opposite ends of a town to clear when one turnout is set ot the main and the other to
        the siding.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="https://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/TurnoutLock.html">Turnout
          Lock</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>A bit of a misnomer, because this refers to locking based on the state of a JMRI
        Turnout, which should be considered a generalized output. Can be used to e.g. lock sections
        when a Call On state (on an internal turnout that represents the state) has been set (by
        e.g. a Maintainer Call section used to set that JMRI Turnout in the field).</dd>
      </dl>

      There's a separate page describing the
      <a href="Conventions.shtml">naming conventions</a> used in the example, in case you find that
      these will save you some work on the setup.

      <p>These tools log information to several JMRI Memory objects, which in turn can be placed
      onto panels as MemoryIcons to show e.g. which lock is preventing an operation.
      Prototype CTC machines don't have these, of course, but they're very useful for
      model railroad dispatchers.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>IMUSS CTC:SIGNALHEADSECTION:1:LOG</dt>

        <dd>What the code line is doing</dd>

        <dt>IMUSS CTC:SIGNALHEADSECTION:1:TIME</dt>

        <dd>Whether time is running</dd>

        <dt>IMUSS CTC:LOCK:1:LOG</dt>

        <dd>Whether any locks are showing as locked</dd>
      </dl>
      The "1" in those can change if there's more than one set of objects, i.e. if more than one
      code line is being modelled.
      <h3>Standalone Tools</h3>
      These can be created from the USS menu under Tools in JMRI applications. They work by
      creating Logix and/or Routes that implement the desired functionality. You could do that by
      hand, of course, but these are meant as a simplification.
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/FollowerFrame.shtml">Follower</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Slaves an output Turnout device to follow the state of an input Sensor device. This
        could, for example, make a layout turnout follow a fascia switch connected to a
        Sensor.</dd>

        <dt>
          <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/ussctc/OsIndicatorFrame.shtml">OS Indicator</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>Drives the occupancy indicator lamps on the Panel. This takes input from a Sensor to
        show the track section is occupied, and also optionally can light the indicator if the
        section has been unlocked.</dd>
