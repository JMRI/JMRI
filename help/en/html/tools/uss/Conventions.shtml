      <h2>JMRI: USS CTC Tools Recommendations</h2>

      <p>This page discussions some conventions that might be useful when setting up a CTC panel
      using the USS CTC tools. Basically, this is how we did the examples, and it might be a
      helpful approach for you to organize all the needed info.</p>

      <p>User names for devices:</p>

      <p>The indicators on the panel are driven by Turnouts named things like "CTC 31 N" or "CTC 31
      R" for a turnout lever, or "CTC 32 R", "CTC 32 C" or "CTC 32 L" for a signal lever.</p>

      <p>The Sensors that are connected to switch inputs on the panel use the same names, though
      the center one on a signal (i.e. "CTC 32 C") is often omitted.</p>

      <p>Occupancy detector Sensors are labelled as "Track Circuits", i.e. "TC 12". The
      corresponding lamp on the panel is driven by a Turnout of the same name, "TC 12".</p>

      <p>The code button and code light are called "Code Button 32" and "Code Lamp 32"
      respectively.</p>

      <p>Maintainer call turnouts and sensors are labelled as e.g. "MC 88".</p>

      <p>The real turnout on the layout is known as "CTC 3 Turnout".</p>

      <p>Signals are around an OS section are known by the section number and location: "CTC 4 main
      upper", "CTC 4 main lower", "CTC 4 main single", "CTC 4 siding".
