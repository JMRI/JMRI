      <h2>JMRI: USS CTC Tools Recommendations</h2>

      <p>This page discussions some conventions that might be 
        useful when setting up a CTC panel using the USS CTC tools.
        Basically, this is how we did the examples, and it might be 
        a helpful approach for you to organize all the needed info.</p>
            
    <p>
        User names for devices:
    <p>
        The indicators on the panel are driven by Turnouts named things like "CTC 31 N" or "CTC 31 R"
        for a turnout lever, or "CTC 32 R", "CTC 32 C" or "CTC 32 L" for a signal lever.
    <p>
        The Sensors that are connected to switch inputs on the panel use the same names,
        though the center one on a signal (i.e. "CTC 32 C") is often omitted.
    <p>
        Occupancy detector Sensors are labelled as "Track Circuits", i.e. "TC 12". 
        The corresponding lamp on the panel is driven by a Turnout of the same name, "TC 12".
    <p>
        The code button and code light are called "Code Button 32" and "Code Lamp 32" respectively.
    <p>
        Maintainer call turnouts and sensors are labelled as e.g. "MC 88".
    <p>
        The real turnout on the layout is known as "CTC 3 Turnout".
    <p>
        Signals are around an OS section are known by the section number and location:
        "CTC 4 main upper", "CTC 4 main lower", "CTC 4 main single", "CTC 4 siding".
