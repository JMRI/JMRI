      <h1>JMRI: Sensors Documentation</h1>

        <h2>What are Sensors?</h2>

        <p>A Sensor is JMRI's way of representing an input from the
        layout.</p>

        <p>JMRI uses a Sensor to represent the status of a block occupancy detector, or a pushbutton on the fascia,
        or just about anything else you can attach to an input on your DCC or C/MRI system. Sensors are created and
        managed in the <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor Table.</a></p>

        <h3>Controlling a Sensor</h3>

        <p>Generally, you don't control the state of a Sensor
        object; JMRI, working with the hardware on your layout,
        does.</p>

        <p>But there are some occasions where you might like to
        locally change the state of a Sensor: To debug some logic
        that uses the Sensor as an input, etc. It can be very
        convenient to temporarily change how a Sensor is set
        without having to run out to the layout and push a button
        or put a locomotive in a block.</p>

        <p>Therefore, JMRI lets you change a Sensor via the Sensor
        Table (see below), or by clicking on a sensor icon on a
        panel (See the <a href=
        "../apps/PanelPro/index.shtml">PanelPro pages</a> for
        more on Panels).</p>

        <p>The change takes effect immediately, unless <a href="#Debounce"> a debounce timer</a> is configured,
        but only lasts until the next time you change it in the program, or the next time the input hardware on
        the layout changes the value.</p>

        <h2>The Sensor Table</h2>

        Sensors can be viewed and configured using the <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">
        Sensor Table</a>. The following columns are displayed by default (additional columns may be displayed by
        right-clicking in the column header and checking by their names, or checking the boxes at the bottom of the
        window):

        <ul>
          <li>System Name</li>

          <li>User Name (optional)</li>

          <li>State (either Active, Inactive, Inconsistent or - at
          first - Unknown</li>

          <li>Comment (optional, double click to edit)</li>

          <li>Inverted (checkbox)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Sensor State column can be displayed either as text or as icons.  This can be set as a global preferences
        via a display setting in the main <strong>Preferences</strong> menu under <strong>Display.</strong>

        <h3>Saving Sensors to disk</h3>

        <p>Sensors are kept in your <i>layout configuration</i>, along with Turnouts, Lights, Signal Heads, control panel
        setup etc. To store this information on disk, allowing you to <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload
        it</a> the next time you run JMRI, see <a href="../apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">
        Loading and Storing Your Work</a>.
        </p>

        <a name="add" id="add"></a>
        <h3>Adding a New Sensor</h3>

        <p>To create a new Sensor, follow this procedure:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Click <strong>Tools &rArr; Tables &rArr; Sensors</strong> to display the <a href=
            "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor Table</a> pane. Next, click the
            <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorAddEdit.shtml"><strong>Add...</strong></a>
            button at the bottom of the pane to bring up the "Add/Edit Sensor" window.
          </li>

          <li>
            From the <strong>System</strong> drop down list select the
            system to which the Sensor is connected. In the
            <strong>Hardware Address</strong> field enter the <a href=
            "../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#systeminfo">hardware
            address of the input connection</a> being
            referenced.<br>
            The format of the Hardware Address can often be made in
            the format of "board:channel" or "Cab Address:Pin"; you
            will need to confirm the specifics of each system's
            <a href=
            "../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#systeminfo">Naming
            Rules</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
            Optionally, enter a User Name for the Sensor. Any string not used by other Sensors will be accepted, but it is
            useful to enter a name that describes the intended use or location of the Sensor.
          </li>

          <li>
            You can add a number of Sensors at once by clicking on the <strong>Add a Range</strong> checkbox and
            then entering the <strong>Number to Add.</strong> JMRI will increment the hardware number for each additional
            sensor.  If a hardware address already exists in the Sensors range that is being added, then JMRI will skip
            that address. If you have entered a User Name, then a number will be appended for each additional sensor to
            ensure that the User Name is unique.
          </li>

          <li>
            Click the <strong>OK</strong> button at the bottom of the
            pane. If everything is fine, a message stating "New
            Sensor added..." will be displayed in the notes area.
            If there is trouble with anything, an error or warning
            message will be displayed in the notes area; you should
            then correct the error and click <strong>OK</strong> again.
          </li>

          <li>
            You will then see the current status of the sensor (or sensors) in the main Sensor Table panel.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>For additional information about working with the Sensor Table,
        <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">click here.</a>

        <h3>Sensor Table Controls</h3>

        <p>Below the table are check boxes to display additional columns with sensor control information.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Defaults</strong> pulldown menu on the window menu bar allows you to set two system-wide
        settings:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="#Debounce">Global Debounce Delay</a>: to set debounce time on a system-wide basis (unless overridden). See also below.</li>

          <li>Initial Sensor State (for Internal Sensors only): lets you choose what state Internal Sensors (system name beginning with
       "IS") will display after JMRI startup. [Note that the initial state of other sensors cannot be set directly by JMRI,
       although you can use a <a href="scripting/index.shtml">script</a> to set them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a name="Debounce" id="Debounce"></a>Sensor Debounce Delay</h2>

        <p>The Sensor Debounce Delay helps prevent false triggers of a Sensor being passed into the system and
        triggering other events in the system.<br>
        Such false triggers could be due to a dirty piece of track
        or electrical interference.</p>

        <p>You can assign a delay in milliseconds before any sensor change is registered with the rest
        of the system. If after that period the state has not changed compared to the original state, the Sensor state
        will be passed onto the rest of the system.<br>
        However if the Sensor's state is different after the delay
        has passed, then the system will restart the process,
        this time after the timer has finished it will check to see
        if the sensor state is in the same state as it was before
        it restarted the process. If not the process is re-started
        again until the state is the same before and after the
        delay has passed.</p>

        <h2>Sensor Groups</h2>

        <p>A Sensor Group is a group of sensors of which at most one can be active at a time.  When one member of the group
        becomes active, all others are set to inactive.</p>

        <p>Sensor Groups are configured via the <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/sensorgroup/SensorGroupFrame.shtml">
        Sensor Group Tool</a>.</p>
