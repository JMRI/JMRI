    <h1>JMRI: Entry/Exit (NX) Routing Documentation</h1>

    <p>Note:  References to "<strong>turnout</strong>" in this documentation
    include all types, including slips and cross-overs.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>NX Routing builds a dynamic valid path between two
    locations on a Layout Editor panel.
    The path can traverse a number of Turnouts and different
    Blocks. The Entry and Exit locations on the Layout Editor are
    defined by the placement of Sensors at various Block
    boundaries. When two Sensors are activated and a clear and
    valid route is found between them, then the Turnouts in the
    route will automatically be set accordingly. If the path between
    the two sensors was created with the type set to <strong>Full Interlock</strong>,
    then the blocks will be reserved and will display a different track
    color.</p>

    <p>If there are multiple paths between two locations, then
    the system will use the path with the smallest cost or number
    of different Blocks. If one of the Blocks on the path is
    already occupied and there is a valid alternative path, then
    this will be taken.</p>

    <p>The two sensors are referred to as an <strong>NX Pair</strong>.<br>
    <em>It is
    also possible to define an NX pair where the destination sensor is on another
    panel. This requires that the panels are linked using <strong>Edge
    Connectors</strong>.</em><span class="since">since 4.11.1</span></p>

    <a name="nxtypes" id="nxtypes"></a>
    <h3>Entry/Exit Types</h3>
    <p>There are three different types of Entry/Exit pairs that can be
    configured.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Turnout Only</li>
      <li>Turnout and SignalMast Logic</li>
      <li>Full Interlocking</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Turnout Only</strong> &mdash; With turnout only, the NX Pair
    will only set the turnouts to the correct state for that route. If a
    block is already showing as occupied or reserved within that route, and an
    alternative one is available then the alternative route will be set,
    otherwise the route will not be set.</p>

    <p><strong>Turnout and SignalMast Logic</strong> &mdash; This option
    includes what is covered by "Turnout Only" and will also generate the
    SignalMast Logic for that route. The logic will include the turnout states
    and the blocks that are within that route. For this to work, SignalMasts
    must also be placed at the same boundary points as the sensors working
    in the same direction.  The SignalMast logic will remain for the duration
    of the operating session, however it is not saved and will be re-created
    the next time the panel is opened.  When there is no route set then the
    SignalMast will be placed in a held state.</p>

    <p><strong>Full Interlocking</strong> &mdash; This covers the same things
    as the other two items above. In addition, it will also "reserve" or
    "lock out" each block in the route so that no other conflicting route can
    be set. If block occupancy detection is being used the route will
    automatically be cleared down. If no block occupancy is being used, then it
    is possible to manually clear the route down by selecting the corresponding
    NX pair, it will leave the last block as showing occupied, as if the train
    had travelled the route and was now sitting waiting at the next signal.
    If there are no Signalmasts configured between the NX pair, then the route
    will still be set and reserved, but no SignalMast Logic will be generated.
    The route will stay active, until either a train has passed through the
    blocks and they have returned to an unoccupied state, the route has been
    manually cleared down, or has been cancelled.  The normal mode for related
    signal mast is to keep the mast in a Held state until a route has been
    create, at which time the hold is released.  When the first block becomes
    occupied the hold is set.  If all of the NX Pairs related to a source mast
    are disabled, then the hold for the mast is released, effectively setting
    the mast to ABS mode.</p>

    <p>For the second and third types, if the signal mast logic has already been
    created, temporary signal mast logic will not be created.</p>

    <h2>How to set up for Entry Exit Routing</h2>

    Entry/Exit routing requires a representation of the layout using Layout
    Editor panels.  If desired, multiple panels can be used that are linked
    using Edge Connectors.  For Layout Editor details, see
    <a href=
    "../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout
    Editor</a>. <a href="Blocks.shtml">Blocks</a> will also need
    be assigned to all of the controlled track components so that
    <a href="Sensors.shtml">Sensors</a> can be assigned to their boundaries.

    <h3>Placing Sensors</h3>

    <p>Sensors, along with Signal Heads and Signal Masts, can be added at
    <strong>Block Boundaries</strong>.  Block boundaries can occur at
    <strong>Anchor Points</strong>, <strong>Turnouts</strong>,
    <strong>Level Crossings</strong> and <strong>End Bumpers</strong>.
    <strong>Edge Connectors</strong> are always a block boundary.</p>

    <p>Sensors are assigned to anchor points, end bumpers and edge connectors by
    right clicking on the small colored box that represents the point and
    select <strong>Set Sensors...</strong>.  For end bumpers there will be
    one choice to make.  Anchor points and edge connectors provide two choices.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <img src="images/EntryExitAnchorPoint.png"
    height="512" width="364" alt="Anchor Point Dialog">
    </div>

    <p>Select the sensor name that will be used to protect the desired block.
    This becomes the entry sensor for routes starting with this block.  It is
    also the exit sensor for routes that end before the desired block.
    <strong>Note:</strong> For edge connectors, ignore the East and West
    reference.  Use only the <strong>Protecting Block</strong> to determine
    which section to use.</p>

    <p>Turnouts and level crossings can have from zero to four block boundaries.
    If a track segment is attached to a turnout leg and it has been assigned
    the same block as the turnout itself, there will not be a boundary for that
    leg.</p>

    <p>Right click the turnout or level crossing and select <strong>Set
    Sensors...</strong>.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <img src="images/EntryExitTurnout.png"
    height="518" width="484" alt="Turnout Dialog">
    </div>

    <p>For turnouts and level crossings, the <strong>protected block</strong>
    is the block that contains the turnout or level crossing.  In other words,
    sensors are for the boundary going <em>into</em> the turnout or crossing.
    It is not possible to add a sensor for the boundary going <em>out</em> from
    the turnout or crossing.</p>

    <h3>Removing Sensors</h3>

    <p>Removing an Entry/Exit sensor from the Layout Editor panel requires that
    the Entry/Exit pairs that use the sensor are removed from the Entry/Exit
    list.  If any affected Entry/Exit pair is being used in a Logix Conditional,
    the sensor removal process is stopped.</p>

    <p>The primary method for deleting an Entry/Exit sensor is to right click
    on the icon and select <strong>Remove</strong>.  A dialog box is displayed
    with 3 buttons.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <img src="images/EntryExitIconDelete.png"
    height="167" width="444" alt="Icon Delete Options">
    </div>

    <p>Select <strong>Cancel</strong> to stop the delete process,
    <strong>No</strong> to delete the icon but leave the sensor reference, or
    <strong>Yes</strong> to delete the icon and the sensor reference.</p>

    <p>The other method to delete a sensor is to use the <strong>Set Sensors...
    </strong> option described above and select either a different sensor or
    the blank row at the top of the sensor list.</p>

    <h4>Logix Conditional Check</h4>
    <p>Before the delete process can begin, the Entry/Exit pairs that use the
    selected sensor cannot be used in any Logix Conditional.  If any are used,
    a list of the Conditionals is displayed and the delete process is terminated.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <img src="images/EntryExitConditionalList.png"
    height="167" width="503" alt="NX Conditional List">
    </div>

    <h4>Entry/Exit Pair Check</h4>
    <p>The next step in the delete process will provide a list of the Entry/Exit
    pairs that will be deleted if the sensor is deleted.
    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <img src="images/EntryExitPairList.png"
    height="226" width="448" alt="NX Pair Delete List">
    </div>
    <p>Select <strong>No</strong> to terminate the delete process,
    <strong>Yes</strong> to finish the delete process.</p>

    <h4>Block Name Changes</h4>
    <p>Sensor assignments define Entry/Exit locations within the layout block
    structure.  If an Entry/Exit pair contains references to the block, the
    block name cannot be renamed or removed.  The block selection field in the
    <strong>Edit Track</strong> dialog will be disabled.  A dialog box will
    be displayed showing the affected sensors.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <img src="images/EntryExitSensorList.png"
    height="199" width="685" alt="NX Sensor List">
    </div>

    <h3>Generating Entry Exit Pairs</h3>
    <p>To access the <strong>Add Entry Exit Points</strong> panel, select
    <strong>Entry Exit</strong> from the Layout Editor <strong>Tools</strong>
    menu. Entry/Exit pairs can be created manually using the <strong>Add Pair
    </strong> button or automatically using the <strong>Auto Generate Entry-Exit
    Pairs</strong> button.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <p><img src="../../package/jmri/jmrit/entryexit/images/EntryExitWindow.png"
    height="517" width="896" alt="NX Window"><br>For additional details, see
    <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/entryexit/EntryExitFrame.shtml">
    Entry/Exit (NX) Tools</a></p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Auto Generate Entry-Exit Pairs</strong>
    will discover all the valid Entry Exit pairs on the Layout Editor layout. Using the
    combo boxes it is also possible to manually add in additional Entry Exit
    pairs.<br>
    In all cases when the <strong>From</strong> Sensor is set active
    followed by the <b>To</b> Sensor, the route will be set between those two
    points and the two Sensors will return back to the "Inactive" state. If the
    <strong>Both Way</strong> option is ticked, then it is possible to activate
    the route in either direction, i.e. you can select the <b>To</b> Sensor
    prior to the <b>From</b> Sensor and the same route will be set.</p>

    <p>With the manual method, it is possible to create invalid pairs.  Invalid
    pairs will never be used.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>Once the NX pairs have been created, a route can be set by selecting the
    <strong>Entry Sensor</strong>, followed by the <strong>Exit Sensor</strong>.
    When the entry sensor is selected, it will start flashing.  When the exit
    sensor is selected, a route will be created if possible.  If a valid route
    cannot be found, both sensors will return to the inactive state. If a valid
    path can be found then the route will be set up according to how it has
    been configured. If full interlock has been configured for the NX Pair the
    sensors will remain active and the track components will be assigned the
    alternate track color.</p>

    <p>Whenever an entry NX Sensor has been selected, it will flash until a
    valid exit sensor has been selected. If no valid exit sensor has been
    selected it will automatically be cancelled after 30 seconds.</p>

    <h3>Extended Route Setting</h3>

    <p>Normally with the NX interlock, a route will be up by selecting the
    Entry/Exit sensors along a path, so for example to get from location A to
    D, A-B would be selected, then B-C and finally C-D. However the system will
    allow the full route to be set up by selecting A and D. The system will then
    go through and find the best valid path and set up each individual interlock
    along the path.<br>
    <strong>Note: </strong>If an extended route is cleared or cancelled, each
    segment will need to be cancelled or cleared by responding to the prompt.</p>

    <h3>Route Stacking &mdash; Following</h3>

    <p>When using the Full Interlock NX type, re-selecting the entry and exit
    sensors will display a dialog box:</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <img src="images/EntryExitStack1.png"
    height="135" width="380" alt="Re-select Dialog">
    </div>

    <p>Options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancel &mdash; Cancel the route.  The block reservations will be
      released and the track components will be set to the normal color.</li>
      <li>Clear Down &mdash; The blocks will be set occupied and then not
      occupied in sequence as if a train had traversed the route.  The last
      block in the route will be left occupied.   This can be useful for
      simulating train movements or for layouts that don't have block detection.</li>
      <li>Stack &mdash; Add this route to a pending list of routes.  When the
      first route completes, the next route in the list will be activated.  For
      multiple segment routes, one segment at a time will be added to the list.</li>
      <li>Exit &mdash; Do nothing, close the window.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pending route list:</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <img src="images/EntryExitStackList.png"
    height="225" width="269" alt="Re-select Dialog">
    </div>

    <p>Once a route has been stacked, the system will check every 10 seconds to
    see if it is possible to set up that NX route. Multiple NX routes can be
    stacked, and they are checked in the order which they were stacked. An NX
    route cannot be stacked more than once. To cancel an NX route, select it in
    the table and click on the "Cancel" button at the bottom.</p>

    <h3>Route Stacking &mdash; Conflicts</h3>

    <p>If a selected route tries to cross a block that is occupied or reserved
    and there is not an alternate route available, the <strong>Route Not Clear
    </strong> dialog box is displayed.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <img src="images/EntryExitStack2.png"
    height="167" width="485" alt="Conflict Dialog">
    </div>

    <p>If Yes is selected, the route will be added to the pending route list.
    <strong>Note:</strong> Only single segment conflicts are detected.  A
    multiple segment route request will not provide the stack option.

    <h3>Logix Support</h3>

    There are two conditional variables and three actions that can be used in
    Logix Conditionals.
    <ul>
      <li>Variables
        <ul>
          <li>NX Pair Active &mdash; Check if a segment for the selected NX Pair
          is Active.</li>
          <li>NX Pair Inactive &mdash; Check if a segment for the selected NX Pair
          is Inactive.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Actions<span class="since">since 4.11.1</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Set NX Pair Enabled &mdash; Enable an NX Pair.  When enabled, it can
          used to create a route.</li>
          <li>Set NX Pair Disabled &mdash; Disable an NX Pair.  This will prevent
          the use of the pair to create a route.</li>
          <li>Set NX Pair Segment Active / Inactive &mdash; If the route is not
          active, create the route, otherwise clear down, cancel or stack the
          route depending on the default actions or user response.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
