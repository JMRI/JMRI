      <h2>Action dialogs</h2>

      <p>When the category and type has been selected, the detail action dialog will be displayed.
      The content of the dialog will vary depending on the category and type. The typical digital
      action item dialog is described below.</p>

      <p>The dialog for adding and editing digital action items consists of an upper part that
      contains the item and the actions for that item. The lower part is common to all actions.</p>

      <p>For some actions, for example Signal head, you need to first select the item and then you
      can select the action to do on that item. For example, for Signal head, you first select the
      signal head to act on and then you can select the appearance to set for that signal head.</p>

        alt="Chapter 5 typical action"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The <strong>Edit</strong> screen is the same except for the title, the Create button and
      the current content will be in the fields.</p>

      <p>The left section is normally used to select the item, such as a turnout or a sensor. The
      right section is the action to be performed. The default mode will be to use the
      <strong>Direct</strong> tabs.</p>

      <p>See <a href="chapter7.shtml">Reference</a>, <a href="chapter8.shtml">Local Variable</a>
      and <a href="chapter9.shtml">Formula</a> for details about the other tabs.</p>

      <p>The lower section contains a standard set of items</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Error Handling</dt>

        <dd>
          If <strong>Use default</strong> is selected, the value in <a href=
          "../LogixNG.shtml#preferences">Preferences</a> will be used. For other options see
          <a href="../ErrorHandling.shtml">error handling</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Catch "Abort execution"</dt>

        <dd>If the error handling (see previous) for any child node is set to <strong>Abort
        execution</strong>, a parent node should have this option checked. This lets the parent
        node handle the error.</dd>

        <dt>Edit comment</dt>

        <dd>Each action can have a comment. The comment dialog has a multiline text area. Click
        <strong>OK</strong> to save the comment.</dd>

        <dt>Formula functions</dt>

        <dd>
          These are explained in the <a href="chapter9.shtml">Formula</a> chapter.
        </dd>

        <dt>Cancel</dt>

        <dd>Close the dialog without applying any changes.</dd>

        <dt>Create/OK</dt>

        <dd>Save the new action or the changes to an existing action.</dd>

      <h4>Block</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Block Sensor Active:</strong> Set the sensor that provides occupancy to
        active.</li>

        <li><strong>Block Sensor Inactive:</strong> Set the sensor that provides occupancy to
        inactive.</li>

        <li><strong>Alternate Color On:</strong> Enable alternate color for the related layout
        block.</li>

      <h4>Clock<span class="since">updated 4.99.7</span></h4>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <a href="images/chapter5/clock_action.png"><img src="images/chapter5/clock_action.png"
        alt="Chapter 5 clock action"></a>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set Fast Clock:</strong> Sets the time on the fast clock to the entered time.
        The time can be entered as hh:mm where hh is hours and mm is minutes on a 24-hour clock or
        as the number of minutes since midnight, such as 720 for noon. This action sets the fast
        clock to the specified time regardless of whether the fast clock is running or stopped.</li>

        <li><strong>Start Fast Clock:</strong> Starts the JMRI fast clock running. If the fast
        clock is already running, this action has no effect.</li>

        <li><strong>Stop Fast Clock:</strong> Pauses the JMRI fast clock. If the fast clock is not
        running, this action has no effect.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In addition to setting the time using a constant value, the other LogixNG modes can be
      used.   For example, the new time can be in a memory variable which will be used to set the
      fast clock time.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <a href="images/chapter5/clock_memory.png"><img src="images/chapter5/clock_memory.png"
        alt="Chapter 5 clock memory source"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The Memory <strong><em>listen</em></strong> option can used to automatically update the
      fast clock time when the memory variable changes.  This eliminates the need to have a separate
      expression to invoke the <strong>Set Fast Clock</strong> action.</p>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Clock Rate<span class="since">since 4.99.7</span></h4>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <a href="images/chapter5/clock_rate_action.png"><img src="images/chapter5/clock_rate_action.png"
        alt="Chapter 5 clock rate action"></a>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set Clock Rate:</strong> Sets the rate for the fast clock to the entered value.
        For example, a value of 4 will set the fast clock rate to 4:1, which is 15 real minutes for
        a fast clock hour.</li>

        <li><strong>Increase Clock Rate:</strong> Increase the fast clock speed by the entered
        value.</li>

        <li><strong>Decrease Clock Rate:</strong> Decrease the fast clock speed by the entered
        value.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The rate values can be whole numbers or decimals, such as .5.  The rate values can also
      be supplied from the other LogixNG modes, such as a memory variable.</p>


      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Dispatcher</h4>

      <p>A Dispatcher train only exists from the time it is created until it is terminated.
      LogixNG uses the Dispatcher TrainInfo file to refer to a potential Dispatcher train.
      See the <em>Saving and Retrieving Active Train Information</em> section at
      <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/NewTrain.shtml">
      Activate New Train</a>.  If the related train does not exist when the LogixNG action occurs,
      the action will be ignored.  There will be no notification.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Load train from train info file:</strong> Create a new Dispatcher train using
        the selected train info file.</li>
        <li><strong>Terminate train:</strong> Terminate a Dispatcher train that was previously
        started using LogixNG.</li>
        <li><strong>Set train priority:</strong> Change the priority of a train.  The default is
        5.  The allowed range is 0 to 100.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Reset when Done:</strong> Enable or disable the <em>Reset when Done</em>
        option.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Terminate when Done</strong> Enable or disable the <em>Terminate when Done</em>
        option.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Enable/Disable Logix</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable:</strong> Enables the specified logix. Specify the logix to enable by
        selecting its name.</li>

        <li><strong>Disable:</strong> Disables the specified logix. Specify the logix to disable by
        selecting its name.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Enable/Disable LogixNG<span class="since">since 5.7.5</span></h4>

      <p>A LogixNG has to be both <strong>enabled</strong> and <strong>activated</strong> before it
      will execute.</p>

      <p><strong>Enable/Disable</strong> are intended to be persistent changes.
      <strong>Activate/Deactivate</strong> are temporary changes.</p>

        <li><strong>On:</strong> Set the selected light on.</li>

        <li><strong>Toggle:</strong> Toggle the selected light.</li>

        <li><strong>Set Intensity:</strong> Sets the intensity of a specified variable intensity
        light to the entered intensity value. Specify the light to set by selecting its name.
        Specify the intensity by entering the percent intensity as an integer in the range 0 to
        100. If the specified light is not a variable light, or if the intensity value entered is
        not an integer in the required range, an error message is displayed.</li>

        <li><strong>Set Transition Time:</strong> Sets the transition time of a specified variable
        intensity light to the entered time. Specify the light to set by selecting its name.
        Specify the transition time by entering the number of fast clock minutes needed to move
        from 0% intensity to 100% intensity. If the specified light is not a variable light, or if
        a positive integer is not entered for the number of fast clock minutes, an error message
        results.</li>

        <li><strong>Unknown:</strong> Set the selected light state to unknown.</li>

        <li><strong>Inconsistent:</strong> Set the selected light state to inconsistent.</li>

      </ul>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Light intensity</h4>

      <p>The Light intensity action is an alternate method to set the Variable Light Intensity
      value. The standard method sets the value directly from the action using any of the standard
      input methods.</p>

      <p>This action creates a child analog expression called <strong>Intensity</strong>. Analog
      expressions are normally used to create a dynamic values, such as random numbers. Using the
      <code>sin()</code> function along with the <a href="chapter6.shtml#MidnightMinutes">Minutes
      since midnight</a> analog expression, it is possible to change light intensity based on the
      time of the day using the fast clock or the system clock.</p>

      <p>Here is an example using the sin() function.</p>

      <h4>Reporter</h4>

      <p>The Reporter action is used to copy the report content to a memory variable or a LogixNG
      local variable.  There are three kinds of information.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Current Report:</strong> The current value unless the hardware says there is
        nothing to report.  In that case the value will be null.</li>

        <li><strong>Last Report:</strong> Normally the current report and last report are the same.
        If the current report is null, this will be most recent valid report.  If no report has ever
        been received, this will be null.</li>

        <li><strong>State:</strong> A number that represents the last report.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note:  The meaning of the reports and the state number are defined by originating
      hardware.</p>

      <h4 id="requestUpdateAll">Request update of all sensors<span class="since">since 5.1.6</span></h4>

      <p>Request the current status of sensors.  The request can be limited to specific connections
      or all connections.  The action depends on whether the connection supports sensor state
      requests.</p>

      <p>As of JMRI 5.7.5, supported connection types include :</p>
      <ul>
      <li>BiDiB</li>
      <li>CBUS</li>

      <li>XBee</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For connections that send individual Sensor status requests,
      the delay between individual requests uses the connection Output Interval
      within Additional Connection Settings.</p>

      <p>Some hardware types, eg. Acela and NCE,
      are constantly polled so this action may have little consequence.</p>

      <p>The formula action is in particular useful when working with local variables. You can for
      example increase a local variable by the formula <code>index++</code> or make some
      calculations, like <code>turnout = name.substring(2)</code> which removes the first two
      characters from the string.</p>

      <h4  id="ExecuteDelayed">Execute delayed</h4>

      <p>Delay the execution of the following action for a specified amount of time. This is the

      used with any action, such as signals. The time delay units are milliseconds, seconds,
      minutes and hours.</p>

      <p>The default mode is that once a timer starts, subsequent requests will be ignored. If
      <strong>Restart timer if already started</strong> is selected and a timer is already running,
      it will be canceled and started again.  The subsequent action will be delayed until the timer
      finishes.  If <strong>Use individual timers</strong> is selected, each request will be
      independent.</p>

      <p>See <a href="#timeout">Timeout</a> for a conditional delayed execution.</p>

      <p>Options:</p>
      <dl style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <dt>Start timer immediately on load</dt>
        <dd>When selected, the timer steps will start when the LogixNG has been loaded.  If this
        option is not selected, a <strong>Start</strong> expression will be used to start the timer
        steps when the expression becomes true.</dd>

        <dt>Run timer continuously</dt>
        <dd>If not selected, the timer will run one time and then stop.  When selected, the timer
        steps will repeat.  A <strong>Stop</strong> expression can be used to stop the timer
        steps when the expression becomes true.  The Stop expression can use the same object, such
        as a sensor that starts the timer when active and then stops the timer when the sensor is
        inactive.</dd>

        <dt>Start/Stop by Start expression</dt>
        <dd>When selected, the timer will start when the <strong>Start</strong> expression becomes
        true and will stop when the <strong>Start</strong> expression becomes false.  The <strong>
        Stop</strong> expression is ignored.</dd>

        <dt>Combo Box</dt>
        <dd>Select the time unit.</dd>

        <dt>Delay by local variables</dt>
        <dd>Instead of using fixed delay times, it is possible to assign delay times to local
        variables.  The timer step number will be appended to the prefix value, such as delay1,
        delay2, etc.</dd>
      </dl>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <a href="images/chapter5/timer_dialog.png"><img src="images/chapter5/timer_dialog.png" alt=
        "Chapter 5 timer dialog"></a>
      </div>

      <p>If all times to wait are zero, the timer will automatically stop after executing all the
      actions once, even if it is set to run continuously. This is a safety feature to avoid
      locking up JMRI.</p>

      <p>To add a socket for the Timer action, edit the Timer and click the <strong>Add
      timer</strong> button and a new socket will be added to the end. To remove a socket for the
      Timer action, edit the Timer and click the <strong>Remove timer</strong> button and the last
      socket will be removed. The socket can only be removed if there is no action connected to
      it.</p>

      <p>This example shows using the Timer to implement a traffic light. Note: This example shows
      renaming the A1, A2, etc. sockets to meaningful names.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">

        src="images/chapter5/timer_example.png" alt="Chapter 5 timer example"></a>
      </div>

      <p>Another example is using a Timer to blink a light. Create a Timer with a single socket and
      a Light action that toggles the light on/off. If you want different times for on and off,
      create a Timer with two sockets where the first socket turns the light on and the second
      socket turns the light off.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Timer</strong> action can be used in LogixNG Modules.  Due to the nature of
      repetitive timer events, there are some restrictions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The calling LogixNG and the Module run all of their actions with each Timer step.
        Avoid including any other logic in the calling LogixNG or the Module.</li>

        <li>The trigger event for the LogixNG can be either a if-then-else with the expression
        set for <strong>Always execute</strong> or a <strong>Listen on beans</strong> item.</li>

        <li><strong>Start/Stop by Start expression</strong> is selected.</li>

        <li>The <strong>Start</strong> expression for the Timer should be the <strong>Always true</strong> expression.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Break</h4>

      <p>Breaks the execution of a <strong>For</strong>, <strong>For each</strong> or
      <strong>Table: For each</strong> action.</p>

      <p>If Break happens in a Module and there is no loop in the Module itself, it breaks the loop
      in the calling ConditionalNG or Module.</p>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Continue</h4>

      <p>Continues the execution of a <strong>For</strong>, <strong>For each</strong> or
      <strong>Table: For each</strong> action.</p>

      <p>The current execution is aborted and the next loop is executed.</p>

      <p>If Continue happens in a Module and there is no loop in the Module itself, it continues the
      loop in the calling ConditionalNG or Module.</p>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Error</h4>

      <p>Triggers an error. The user can enter an error message if desired.</p>

      <p>This might be useful if a particular condition should never occur in the ConditionalNG or
      Module. In this case, the Error action can be used to alert the user.</p>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Exit</h4>

      <p>Exits the execution of the ConditionalNG. If the Exit action is in a Module, the Module and
      the ConditionalNG will be exited.</p>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>For</h4>

      <p>For is a for-loop. It has four children.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Init</strong> - this action is executed only one time. It's used to initialize
        the loop, for example setting a Memory to a particular value.</li>

        <li><strong>While</strong> - this expression decides if the loop should run one lap more.
        The loop will continue to run until this condition will be <strong>false</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>AfterEach</strong> - this action is executed at the end of the loop. It can for
        example be used to increment a counter in a Memory.</li>

        <li><strong>Do</strong> - this action is executed in each loop. It does the main work.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When For is executed, the Init action is run once. After that, the While expression is
      evaluated. If the While returns <strong>true</strong>, the Do action is executed and at last
      the AfterEach action is executed. Then the process is repeated, except that the Init action
      is only executed once.</p>

      <h4 id="foreach">For each<span class="since">since 5.1.3</span></h4>

      <p><strong>For each</strong> takes a Collection, a Map or a Manager as parameter and loops
      thru all the items.  For maps, each item is a Map.Entry. Use <code>getKey()</code> and
      <code>getValue()</code> to get the key and the value of each item in the map.  If the
      parameter is a manager, the method <code>getNamedBeanSet()</code> is called to get all the
      named beans in the manager.</p>

      <p>Each item is placed in a specified local variable.  The action is then invoked for
      each item.</p>

      <p>The following example sets all of the sensors to Inactive.</p>

      </div>

      <p>There are two settings that control the if-then-else processing.</p>

      <p><u>When is the If-Then-Else executed</u></p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Execute on change</dt>
        <dd> Executes the Then or the Else action only when the If expression has changed from True
        to False, or from False to True.  Note that the expression is assumed to be changed whenever
        the LogixNG is first enabled (including when the xml data file is loaded with "enabled"
        checked). In the simple example  below, Light IL2 will be set "on" when the LogixNG is first
        enabled (Sensor IS1 status is "unknown").  When the sensor is changed to "inactive" the
        lights will not change.  When the sensor is then changed to "active," the Light IL1 will
        also go "on".</dd>

        <dt>Always execute</dt>
        <dd>Executes the Then or the Else action every time the <strong>If Then Else</strong> action
        is executed, regardless of whether the expression has changed value.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p class="noted">The default execution setting can be change using
      <strong>Preferences &rArr; LogixNG</strong>.</p>

        <dt>Evaluate needed expressions</dt>
        <dd>Evaluate each expression element until true/false is determined.  An <strong>And</strong>

      <p>The <strong><em>Else_If</em></strong> option provides a compact method to collapse a
      repetitive nested <strong><em>If-Then-Else</em></strong> tree.</p>

      <p>To create a new Else_If expression/action pair, right click on the <strong>Else</strong>

      <h4>Return</h4>

      <p>Returns from the Module or the ConditionalNG.</p>

      <p>If Return is in a ConditionalNG, it's the same as Exit. But if it's in a Module, it only

      <h4>Run once<span class="since">since 5.3.1</span></h4>

      <p>Run the assigned action only one time during a JMRI session.</p>

      <p>The assigned action will be the <strong>Many</strong> action if there is more than one
      action to be performed.  This provides an alternate method compared to <strong>Trigger once

      <h4 id="sequence_id">Sequence</h4>

      <p>The Sequence action executes a series of action/expression pairs. For each pair, the
      action will be performed and then the expression will wait until it becomes true. When it is
      true, the next action/expression pair will be started.  The <a href="chapter6#timer_id">Timer</a>
      expression can be used to do a time based step instead of an event based step.</p>

        sequence can be started again later.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When a sequence action is added, it has connections for <strong>Start</strong>, <strong>
      Stop</strong> and <strong>Reset</strong> expressions.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start:</strong> When the <strong>Start</strong> expression is true, the sequence
        will start with the first action/expression pair or resume if a stop occurred during the
        sequence.</li>

        <li><strong>Stop:</strong> When the <strong>Stop</strong> expression is true, the sequence
        will stop running.</li>

      <h4>Decode JSON<span class="since">since 5.7.4</span></h4>

      <p>A JSON string in the first variable is decoded as a JsonNode tree and placed in the second
      variable.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/chapter5/decode_json.png">
        <img src="images/chapter5/decode_json.png"
        alt="Chapter 5 decode json"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The decoding process translates the JSON string into a nested set of LogixNG
      <strong>Maps</strong> and <strong>Arrays</strong>.  Use a LogixNG formula to access a particular
      node.</p>

      <p>Here is a sample JSON structure.</p>

<pre style="border: 2px solid #778899; margin: 1em; padding: 0.1em;">
{"menu": {
  "id": "file",
  "value": "File",
  "popup": {
    "menuitem": [
      {"value": "New", "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()"},
      {"value": "Open", "onclick": "OpenDoc()"},
      {"value": "Close", "onclick": "CloseDoc()"}
    ]
  }
}}
</pre>

      <p>Here is a LogixNG that gets the second menuitem value and prints it to the JMRI system
      console.  In this example, <strong>node value = Open</strong> is printed </p>

<pre style="border: 2px solid #778899; margin: 1em; padding: 0.1em;">
       1:  LogixNG: test read
       2:      ConditionalNG: IQC:AUTO:0002
       3:          ! A
       4:              Many
       5:                 ::: Local variable "node", init to String ""
       6:                  ! A1
       7:                      Set variable node to the result of formula "str(jsondecoded{"menu"}{"popup"}{"menuitem"}[1]{"value"})"
       8:                  ! A2
       9:                      Log data: String.format: node value = %s
</pre>

      <p><strong>jsondecoded</strong> is the global variable that has the result of the Decode JSON
      action.  The items in the JSON tree are delimited by braces.  The JSON list rows are referenced
      by row number in brackets.  Note:  The first row is zero.  In this example, all of the node
      values are strings, so the formula is enclosed with a str() command.  Node values can also be
      other data types such as integer and float.  LogixNG has int() and float() commands to handle
      those data types.</p>

      <h4 id="execute-action">Execute action<span class="since">since 5.7.8</span></h4>

      <p><strong>Execute action</strong> is used to execute a different part of the current
      ConditionalNG.  This can be useful if you need to execute a part of the ConditionalNG at
      several different places, for example if you have several <strong>Listen On Beans - Local
      variable</strong> in the same ConditionalNG.  This is similar to calling a sub-routine.</p>

      <p>The first step is to assign a <strong>user name</strong> to the action to be executed.
      Right click on the action and select <strong>Change user name</strong>.  Enter the user
      name and click on OK.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">

        style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1em; padding: 0.1em;"></a>
      </div>

      <p>When the <strong>Execute action</strong> is added, a dialog is displayed.  Select the user
      name from the combo box and click on OK.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/chapter5/execute-action.png">
        <img src="images/chapter5/execute-action.png"
        alt="Chapter 5 execute action"></a>
      </div>

      <p>This example calls a <strong>sub</strong> action to display the current local variables.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/chapter5/execute-action-sample.png">
        <img src="images/chapter5/execute-action-sample.png"
        alt="Chapter 5 execute action sample"></a>
      </div>

      <p>Normally a ConditionalNG will execute all of the actions in the top level <strong>Many</strong>.
      In this example, that would result in a second execution of the <strong>sub</strong> action.
      The <strong>Return</strong> action is used to finish the ConditionalNG execution sequence.</p>

      <p>Note:  This example was used to verify that the local variable list varies depending on
      when the <strong>sub</strong> action was called.</p>

      <p>Add a listener to the bean referenced by a local variable.  The local variable can have
      either the system name, the user name or the bean itself.  The <strong>Execute</strong> socket
      provides the logic that will be executed when an event occurs.</p>

      <h4 id="common_logix_action">Logix</h4>

      <p>LogixNG has an action called <strong>Logix</strong> that emulates how JMRI Logix works. The
      action Logix has one expression and a <a href="#boolean_logix_action">Logix Action</a>.  The
      digital boolean <strong>Many</strong> action can be used to support multiple
      <strong>Logix Actions</strong> as shown in the example.  A Logix Action responds to
      <strong>True</strong>, <strong>False</strong>, or <strong>Either</strong> Logix evaluation
      states.  The action Logix was added mainly to support import of JMRI Logix to LogixNG.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">

      <p>The Logix action supports <strong>On Change</strong> and <strong>When Triggered</strong>.</p>

      <p>An example Logix within LogixNG.  This is a tweaked import from Logix.  The <strong>Log data</strong> actions
      were added and the individual <strong>True</strong> LogixNG actions were combined within a

      <p>This example uses <strong>When Triggered</strong>.  This means that one or more actions
      will be executed when either IS101 or IS102 changes.  The <strong>On Change</strong> option
      only executes the actions when the evaluation of the expression <strong>changes</strong>
      between true and false.</p>

      <h4 id="showDialog">Show dialog<span class="since">since 4.25.8</span></h4>

      <p>The <strong>Show dialog</strong> action displays a window that can be used to provide
      notification of an event that has occurred or needs to be handled.  It can also be used to
      request whether an action should be performed by the LogixNG.</p>

      <p>Normally, warnings and such can be handled by displaying a message in the system console.
      The dialog is useful when an immediate notification is needed.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Show dialog</strong> definition is similar to the <a href="#ActionLogData">
      Log data</a> definition.  See Log data for details on formating and including variables.</p>

        until it is closed.</dd>

        <dt>Multiline</dt>
        <dd>The multiline option enables the ability to have multiple lines displayed by the dialog.

        <dt>Selected button</dt>
        <dd>If a predefined local variable is supplied, the selected button number is copied to the
        local variable.  The button numbers are shown next to the button text in the button
        selection section.</dd>

        <dt>Input string<span class="since">since 4.99.1</span></dt>
        <dd>If a predefined local variable is supplied, a text input field is included. The current
        value of the variable will be displayed in the text input field.  When the dialog is closed
        using one of the buttons, the value in the input field will be copied to the local
        variable.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p class="noted">Note:  When the dialog is displayed, the rest of the conditional continues
      to run.  In the first example, the A3 action will execute while the dialog is displayed.</p>

      <h2 id="digital_boolean_action_common">Digital boolean action :: Common</h2>

      <p>To make import from Logix to LogixNG easier, LogixNG has a special action, <a href="#common_logix_action">Logix</a>, that
      works similar to a Conditional in Logix. The LogixNG Logix action has a digital expression
      socket and a digital boolean action socket. The usual setup in LogixNG is a Logix action with
      a Many child with a number of <strong>Logix Action</strong> children.</p>
