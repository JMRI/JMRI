      <h2>Action dialogs</h2>

      <p>When the category and type has been selected, the detail action dialog will be displayed.
      The content of the dialog will vary depending on the category and type. The typical digital
      action item dialog is described below.</p>

      <p>The dialog for adding and editing digital action items consists of an upper part that
      contains the item and the actions for that item. The lower part is common to all actions.</p>

      <p>For some actions, for example Signal head, you need to first select the item and then you
      can select the action to do on that item. For example, for Signal head, you first select the
      signal head to act on and then you can select the appearence to set for that signal head.</p>

        alt="Chapter 5 typical action" width="922" height="270"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The <strong>Edit</strong> screen is the same except for the title, the Create button and
      the current content will be in the fields.</p>

      <p>The left section is normally used to select the item, such as a turnout or a sensor. The
      right section is the action to be performed. The default mode will be to use the
      <strong>Direct</strong> tabs.</p>

      <p>See <a href="chapter7.shtml">Reference</a>, <a href="chapter8.shtml">Local Variable</a>
      and <a href="chapter9.shtml">Formula</a> for details about the other tabs.</p>

      <p>The lower section contains a standard set of items</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Error Handling</dt>

        <dd>
          If <strong>Use default</strong> is selected, the value in <a href=
          "../LogixNG.shtml#preferences">Preferences</a> will be used. For other options see
          <a href="../ErrorHandling.shtml">error handling</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Catch "Abort execution"</dt>

        <dd>If the error handling (see previous) for any child node is set to <strong>Abort
        execution</strong>, a parent node should have this option checked. This lets the parent
        node handle the error.</dd>

        <dt>Edit comment</dt>

        <dd>Each action can have a comment. The comment dialog has a multiline text area. Click
        <strong>OK</strong> to save the comment.</dd>

      <h4>Dispatcher</h4>

      <p>A Dispatcher train only exists from the time it is created until it is terminated.
      LogixNG uses the Dispatcher TrainInfo file to refer to a potential Dispatcher train.
      See the <em>Saving and Retrieving Active Train Information</em> section at
      <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/NewTrain.shtml">
      Activate New Train</a>.  If the related train does not exist when the LogixNG action occurs,
      the action will be ignored.  There will be no notification.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Load train from train info file:</strong> Create a new Dispatcher train using
        the selected train info file.</li>
        <li><strong>Terminate train:</strong> Terminate a Dispatcher train that was previously
        started using LogixNG.</li>
        <li><strong>Set train priority:</strong> Change the priority of a train.  The default is
        5.  The allowed range is 0 to 100.</li>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Light</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Off:</strong> Set the selected light off.</li>

        <li><strong>On:</strong> Set the selected light on.</li>

        <li><strong>Toggle:</strong> Toggle the selected light.</li>

        <li><strong>Set Intensity:</strong> Sets the intensity of a specified variable intensity
        light to the entered intensity value. Specify the light to set by selecting its name.
        Specify the intensity by entering the percent intensity as an integer in the range 0 to
        100. If the specified light is not a variable light, or if the intensity value entered is
        not an integer in the required range, an error message is displayed.</li>

        <li><strong>Set Transition Time:</strong> Sets the transition time of a specified variable
        intensity light to the entered time. Specify the light to set by selecting its name.
        Specify the transition time by entering the number of fast clock minutes needed to move
        from 0% intensity to 100% intensity. If the specified light is not a variable light, or if
        a positive integer is not entered for the number of fast clock minutes, an error message
        results.</li>

        <li><strong>Unknown:</strong> Set the selected light state to unknown.</li>

        <li><strong>Inconsistent:</strong> Set the selected light state to inconsistent.</li>

      </ul>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Light intensity</h4>

      <p>The Light intensity action is an alternate method to set the Variable Light Intensity
      value. The standard method sets the value directly from the action using any of the standard
      input methods.</p>

      <p>This action creates a child analog expression called <strong>Intensity</strong>. Analog
      expressions are normally used to create a dynamic values, such as random numbers. Using the
      <code>sin()</code> function along with the <a href="chapter6.shtml#MidnightMinutes">Minutes
      since midnight</a> analog expression, it is possible to change light intensity based on the
      time of the day using the fast clock or the system clock.</p>

      <p>Here is an example using the sin() function.</p>

      <h4>Local variable</h4>

      <p>Local variables are described in <a href="chapter8.shtml">Chapter 8 - Local
      Variables</a>.</p>

      <p>Instead of specific actions, local variables use <strong>tabs</strong> to select the
      action.</p>

      <h4>Digital Formula<span class="since">since 4.25.8</span></h4>

      <p>The <strong>Digital Formula</strong> action provides the ability to create formulas that
      are not directly related to other items, such as sensors, which use the Formula tab.</p>

      <p>The formula action is in particular useful when working with local variables. You can for
      example increase a local variable by the formula <code>index++</code> or make some
      calculations, like <code>turnout = name.substring(2)</code> which removes the first two
      characters from the string.</p>

      <p>The dialog for creating a Digital Formula consists of a single text field.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">

      <h4  id="ExecuteDelayed">Execute delayed</h4>

      <p>Delay the execution of the following action for a specified amount of time. This is the
      same as the Logix <strong>Delayed Set ...</strong>. The main difference is that this can be
      used with any action, such as signals. The time delay units are milliseconds, seconds,
      minutes and hours.</p>

      <p>The default mode is that once a timer starts, subsequent requests will be ignored. If
      <strong>Restart timer if already started</strong> is selected and a timer is already running,
      it will be canceled and started again.  The subsequent action will be delayed until the timer
      finishes.  If <strong>Use individual timers</strong> is selected, each request will be
      independent.</p>

      <p>See <a href="#timeout">Timeout</a> for a conditional delayed execution.</p>

      <h4>For</h4>

      <p>For is a for-loop. It has four children.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Init</strong> - this action is executed only one time. It's used to initialize
        the loop, for example setting a Memory to a particular value.</li>

        <li><strong>While</strong> - this expression decides if the loop should run one lap more.
        The loop will continue to run until this condition will be <strong>false</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>AfterEach</strong> - this action is executed at the end of the loop. It can for
        example be used to increment a counter in a Memory.</li>

        <li><strong>Do</strong> - this action is executed in each loop. It does the main work.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When For is executed, the Init action is run once. After that, the While expression is
      evaluated. If the While returns <strong>true</strong>, the Do action is executed and at last
      the AfterEach action is executed. Then the process is repeated, except that the Init action
      is only executed once.</p>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>If Then Else</h4>

      <p>Reads a digital child expression and if the answer is <strong>true</strong> it executes
      the <strong>then</strong> child action, else it executes the <strong>else</strong> child
      action.</p>

      <p>There are two options:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Execute on change:</strong> Executes the Then or the Else action only when the
        If expression has changed from True to False, or from False to True.  Note that the
        expression is assumed to be changed whenever the LogixNG is first enabled (including when
        the xml data file is loaded with "enabled" checked). In the simple example  below, Light IL2
        will be set "on" when the LogixNG is first enabled (Sensor IS1 status is "unknown").  When
        the sensor is changed to "inactive" the lights will not change.  When the sensor is then
        changed to "active," the Light IS1 will also go "on".</li>

        <li><strong>Always execute:</strong> Executes the Then or the Else action every time the
        <strong>If Then Else</strong> action is executed, regardless of whether the expression has
        changed value.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Many</h4>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Read analog and set analog</h4>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Sequence</h4>

      <p>The Sequence action executes a series of action/expression pairs. For each pair, the
      action will be performed and then the expression will wait until it becomes true. When it is
      true, the next action/expression pair will be started. The sequence will repeat forever or
      until stopped.</p>

        "447"></a>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start:</strong> When the start expression is true, the sequence will start with
        the first action/expression pair.</li>

        <li><strong>Stop:</strong> When the stop expression is true, the sequence will stop
        running.</li>

        <li><strong>Reset:</strong> When the reset expression is true, the sequence will be
        interrupted and return to the first action/expresson pair.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>Timer</h4>

      <p><strong>Timer</strong> has a number of actions, each executed after a period of time. The
      time to wait can be 0, which means the related action is executed immediately. The Timer can
      be configured to only execute the actions once or continuously. The Timer can also be
      configured to start when the xml data file is loaded or only start when the "Start"
      expression returns True. The Timer stops when the "Stop" expression returns True. The time
      unit is selected from the combo box.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <a href="images/chapter5/timer_dialog.png"><img src="images/chapter5/timer_dialog.png" alt=
        "Chapter 5 timer dialog" width="995" height="377"></a>
      </div>

      <p>If all times to wait are zero, the timer will automatically stop after executing all the
      actions once, even if it is set to run continuously. This is a safety feature to avoid
      locking up JMRI.</p>

      <p>To add a socket for the Timer action, edit the Timer and click the <strong>Add
      timer</strong> button and a new socket will be added to the end. To remove a socket for the
      Timer action, edit the Timer and click the <strong>Remove timer</strong> button and the last
      socket will be removed. The socket can only be removed if there is no action connected to
      it.</p>

      <p>This example shows using the Timer to implement a traffic light. Note: This example shows
      renaming the A1, A2, etc. sockets to meaningful names.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Another example is using a Timer to blink a light. Create a Timer with a single socket and
      a Light action that toggles the light on/off. If you want different times for on and off,
      create a Timer with two sockets where the first socket turns the light on and the second
      socket turns the light off.</p>

      <p>LogixNG has an action called Logix that emulates how JMRI Logix works. The action Logix
      has one expression and a number of boolean actions. A boolean action is an action that takes
      a boolean value (true/false) and then decides what to do. The action Logix was added mainly
      to support import of JMRI Logix to LogixNG.</p>

      <h4 id="showDialog">Show dialog<span class="since">since 4.25.8</span></h4>

      <p>The <strong>Show dialog</strong> action displays a window that can be used to provide
      notification of an event that has occurred or needs to be handled.  It can also be used to
      request whether an action should be performed by the LogixNG.</p>

      <p>Normally, warnings and such can be handled by displaying a message in the system console.
      The dialog is useful when an immediate notification is needed.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Show dialog</strong> definition is similar to the <a href="#ActionLogData">
      Log data</a> definition.  See Log data for details on formating and including variables.</p>

        <dt>Buttons</dt>
        <dd>One or more buttons can be included in the dialog.  At least one button must be selected.</dd>

        <dt>Modal</dt>
        <dd>A dialog can be <strong>modal</strong> or non-modal.  Modal means that the dialog window
        remains above any other window and the user cannot do anything in any other JMRI window
        until it is closed.</dd>

        <dt>Multiline</dt>
        <dd>The multiline option enables the ability to have multiple lines displayed by the dialog.
        To get a new line, use the HTML <strong>&lt;br&gt;</strong> tag.</dd>

        <dt>Selected button</dt>
        <dd>If a predefined local variable is supplied, the selected button number is copied to the
        local variable.  The button numbers are shown next to the button text in the button
        selection section.</dd>

        <dt>Input string<span class="since">since 4.99.1</span></dt>
        <dd>If a predefined local variable is supplied, a text input field is included. The current
        value of the variable will be displayed in the text input field.  When the dialog is closed
        using one of the buttons, the value in the input field will be copied to the local
        variable.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p class="noted">Note:  When the dialog is displayed, the rest of the conditional continues
      to run.  In the first example, the A3 action will execute while the dialog is displayed.</p>

      <p>After the dialog action has been created, two new rows are added.  These are both optional
      and can be left empty.</p>

      </div>

      <dl>
        <dt>Validate</dt>
        <dd>The <strong>Validate</strong> expression can be used to check for valid input when using
        an input local variable.  If the expression is false, the dialog will remain open until the
        expression is true.  The close button on the window can be used to bypass validation and
        execution.  If the expression is true or no expression was defined, the Execute action will
        run.</dd>

        <dt>Execute</dt>
        <dd>The <strong>Execute</strong> action is run when the validation expression is true or if
        one was not defined.  A common use is handling a multiple button dialog that has the
        selected button local variable.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h4 id="timeout">Timeout<span class="since">since 4.25.8</span></h4>

      <p>The <strong>Timeout</strong> action is used to execute a default action if an expression is
      not true within the specified time internval.</p>

      <p>The Timeout action dialog is similar to the <a href="#ExecuteDelayed">Execute Delayed
      </a> dialog. The <strong>Timeout</strong> configuration also requires an expression.
      If the expression is true before the time expires, the action is not executed.</p>

      <h2 id="digital_boolean_action_common">Digital boolean action :: Common</h2>

      <p>To make import from Logix to LogixNG easier, LogixNG has a special action, Logix, that
      works similar to a Conditional in Logix. The LogixNG Logix action has a digital expression
      socket and a digital boolean action socket. The usual setup in LogixNG is a Logix action with
      a Many child with a number of OnChange children.</p>

      <h4>Many</h4>

      <p>The Many action is used together with the Logix action to let the Logix action have more
      than one action child.</p>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h4>On change</h4>

      <p>This action is used together with the LogixNG Logix action and gives you the option to
      decide if the child action should be executed. The options are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>On change to true</li>

        <li>On change to false</li>

        <li>On change</li>
