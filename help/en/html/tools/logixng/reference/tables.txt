LogixNG Tables

There are three types of tables in LogixNG:

* External tables
  These tables are based on an external file, usually a CSV file (Comma Separated File, but it might be TAB separated as well).

* Internal tables
  These tables are stored in the panel file. It's optional if the table data should be stored in the panel file.

* Internal tables based of a table
  These tables are similar to internal tables, but their number of rows and/or columns are determined of another table.








Example usage of "Internal table based of a table"

If you have a CSV file with a number of rows and you want to have one or several LogixNGs working on a particular row,
you can create an internal table based of the original CSV table, but there the internal table only has one row.

You can then use a LogixNG action to copy one row from the original CSV table to the internal table and then have the
LogixNGs working on this internal table.
