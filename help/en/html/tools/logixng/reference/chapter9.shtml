      <h1>LogixNG Reference - Chapter 9</h1>

      <h2>Formula</h2>

      <p>LogixNG has native support for complex calculations with the tool "Formula". Formula
      supports almost all the Java operators and you can use local variables and functions with
      formula. In many cases, like the action Turnout, you can choose to use formula to get the
      turnout you want to act on, or to get the new state you want to set.</p>

      <p>Local variables, which are explained in <a href="chapter8.shtml">chapter 8</a>, can be
      used directly in formula. So if you have a local variable <em>index</em>, you can for example
      have the formula <em>"IT" + str(index)</em>, which adds the string "IT" and the value of
      <em>index</em>. This can be useful if you for example want to set all the turnouts IT1, IT2,
      IT3, ..., IT10 to thrown. You can then use the <strong>For</strong> action to iterate from 1
      to 10 and to set each of these turnouts to thrown.</p>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h3>The Formula expressions</h3>

      <p>There are three expressions for formula: Analog Formula, Digital Formula and String
      Formula. They all work the same way, except that Analog Formula returns a floating point
      number, Digital Formula returns a boolean value (true or false), and String Formula returns a
      string. The expression Formula can have child expressions, for example reading an analog
      value or reading the state of a sensor. You use the result of the child expressions by using
      the name of the female socket in the formula. So if you have an expression Formula which has
      a child E1 to which an expression Sensor is connected, you can use the result of the
      expression Sensor in the formula by the identifier E1 which points to the female socket and
      its connected expression.</p>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h3>Operators</h3>

      <p>Formula supports most of the Java operators. A list of the Java operators, together with
      the priority of them, is on <a href=
      "https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11precedence/">this page</a>.</p>

      <p>Currently supported operators are:</p>

      </div>

      <p>Note that for the calculations to work, each operand must have the correct type. For
      example, if you have a memory IM1 that has a number as a string and you want to subtrack from
      it, like <code>IM1 - 1</code>, you need to convert the string in IM1 to an integer or a
      float. Example: <code>int(IM1) - 1</code> or <code>float(IM1) - 1</code>. The same rules
      apply to concatenating a string and an integer. The integer has to be converted to a string.
      <code>"IT" + str(index)</code></p>

      <p>In this example, the <strong>A1</strong> section uses the <a href="chapter3.shtml">For</a>
      action to toggle 5 turnouts. The turnout user names are T1 thru T5. The
      <strong><em>index</em></strong> <a href="chapter8.shtml">local variable</a> is used to supply
      the number. The index value has to converted to a string before concatenating with the
      "T"</p>

      <p>The <strong>A2</strong> section is an example of a digital expression. This a simple one
      with just the "and" operator.</p>

      </div>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h3>Functions</h3>

      <p>Formula supports functions, like sin(x) and random(). Some functions takes one or several
      parameters. A function has an identifier, for example "sin", followed by a left parantheses,
      optional one or several parameters separated by comma, and then closed by a right
      parantheses.</p>

      <p>The dialog boxes for editing an action or expression, and the dialog box for editing
      variables, has a button "Formula functions". If you click on that button, you get a new
      dialog box that shows the functions that are available and the documentation on each of
      them.</p>

      <p>One may notice that there is several modules with one or two functions in each module. For
      example, the module Math has the functions random() and sin(). The reason for so many modules
      for so few functions is that the number of functions is expected to grow. For example, the
      Math module should have cos(), tan(), atan() and sqrt(), but these are not implemented
      yet.</p>

      <p>For JMRI developers: The functions are defined in the package
      <em>jmri.jmrit.logixng.util.parser.functions</em> and each module has its own Java class.
      Each function is its own class that implements the <em>Function</em> interface.</p>

      <h4>Documentation of the functions</h4>

      <p>To make it easier to use the functions, each function has some documentation.</p>

      <p>Each action/expression has a <strong>Formula functions</strong> button that opens a dialog
      box with documentation of the functions.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <a href="images/chapter9/function_1.png"><img src="images/chapter9/function_1.png" alt=
        "Chapter 9 function button" width="922" height="270"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The functions are grouped in modules to make it easier to find the functions. Select the
      module you are interested in.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <a href="images/chapter9/function_2.png"><img src="images/chapter9/function_2.png" alt=
        "Chapter 9 select module" width="500" height="621"></a>
      </div>

      <p>Then select the function you are interested in.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">

      </div>

      <p>In this case, the function <strong>fastClock()</strong> take a string parameter which can
      have any of the values <em>hour</em>, <em>min</em> or <em>minOfDay</em>.</p>

      <p>Some functions, for example the function <strong>random()</strong>, can take different
      numbers of parameters. The default is <code>0.0 &lt;= x &lt; 1.0</code>. Supplying
      <em>max</em> or <em>min and max</em> values can change the range.</p>

      <h3 id="jythonFunction">Advanced: Add new function with Jython</h3>

      <p>It's possible to create a new function using Jython to be used by a formula. The code below
      gives an example that you can use as a template. A new function is added by creating a new
      class that extends the class <strong>Function</strong> and implements these methods:</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Method</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>getModule</td>
            <td>The name of the module that the function belongs to</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>getName</td>
            <td>The name of the function</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>getDescription</td>
            <td>Description of the function for the user</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>getConstantDescriptions</td>
            <td>Description of any constants</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>calculate</td>
            <td>Calculate the function</td>
          </tr>

        </table>
      </div>

      <p>Example Jython script that defines the <strong>getBlockValue</strong> function that takes
      the name of a block as its parameter:</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <pre>
import jmri

class BlockValue(jmri.jmrit.logixng.util.parser.Function):
  def getModule(self):
    return 'Custom'

  def getName(self):
    return 'getBlockValue'

  def getDescription(self):
    return 'Get the current value for the specified block name.'

  def getConstantDescriptions(self):
    return None

  def calculate(self, symbolTable, parameterList):
    if (parameterList.size() != 1):
      raise jmri.jmrit.logixng.util.parser.WrongNumberOfParametersException("Function requires one parameter")

    blockName = parameterList.get(0).calculate(symbolTable)
    block = blocks.getBlock(blockName)
    return None if block is None else block.getValue()

jmri.InstanceManager.getDefault(jmri.jmrit.logixng.util.parser.FunctionManager).put("getBlockValue", BlockValue())
        </pre>
      </div>

      <h6>Sample LogixNG conditional</h6>

      <h4>Calculate the function</h4>

      <p>The function <strong>calculate</strong> takes a number of arguments as a
      <strong>List&lt;ExpressionNode&gt;</strong>. We first check the number of arguments by
      calling the method <strong>size()</strong> and if that's correct, we get the arguments by
      calling the method <strong>get(index)</strong> where "index" is the index of the
      argument.</p>

      <p>But to do something useful with the arguments, we need to calculate each argument we want
      to use. We do that by calling the method <strong>calculate</strong> on each argument we want
      to use.</p>

      <p>We then do the calculation, which in this case finds the requested block and returns the
      current value.</p>

      <p>Since the local variables symbol table is also passed to the calculate function, local
      variables are also available to the script using <code>symbolTable.getValue(name)</code> and
      <code>symbolTable(name, new value)</code>.</p>

      <h4>Important!</h4>

      <p>The Jython script needs to loaded before the LogixNG runs that references the custom
      function.  The best approach is to add a start up action to run the script.  When the xml
      data file is loaded, the script will be ready to process the custom function request.</p>

      <p>A function may set turnouts, sensors, and other things on the layout. You may for example
      create the function <strong>setTurnout(turnout, newState)</strong>. But it's important to
      remember that a ConditionalNG runs on a separate thread so if you set a turnout or a sensor,
      you must do that on the layout thread. Formula is always run on the thread that the
      ConditionalNG is run on, so if a function updates the layout or the GUI, it needs to do it on
      the layout thread or the GUI thread.</p>

      <p>See the later chapter on threads (may not exist yet) for more information of LogixNG
      threads.</p>
