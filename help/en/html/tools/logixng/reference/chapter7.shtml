      <h1>LogixNG Reference - Chapter 7</h1>

      <h2>References</h2>

      <p>The following discussion refers to {name}. This can be either a JMRI memory variable or a
      LogixNG Local Variable.</p>

      <p>LogixNG can use references to access layout items like turnouts in an indirect way. It's
      done by entering the system name or user name in curly brackets. If a turnout action has the
      turnout IT1, it will access that turnout directly. But if the turnout action has the turnout
      {IM2}, it will read that memory and if that memory has a string as a value, it will use that
      string value to find the turnout. So if the memory IM2 has the value IT5, and the turnout
      action has the turnout {IM2}, the turnout action will read the memory IM2 and find out that
      it points to the turnout IT5 and therefore do it's action on turnout IT5. The benefit of this
      is that the Memory can be changed during execution and therefore the same turnout action can
      be used to access different turnouts at different times.</p>

      <p>It's possible to use indirect access recursive. If a turnout action has the turnout {IM5},
      and that Memory has the value {IM14}, and that the Memory IM14 has the value IT3, the turnout
      action will access IT3. The turnout action has an indirect turnout IM5 so it will read that
      Memory. And since that memory has the value {IM14} which also is an indirect access, it will
      read the memory IM14 and find out that it has the value IT3, and therefore use IT3. This is
      also true for tables. If the cell IQT1[5,3] has the value '{IM3}', and the memory IM3 has the
      value 'IT5', the cell IQT1[5,3] will point to IT5.</p>

      <p>When the Reference tab is selected, the appropriate values are entered into the text
      field. References are the name of a local variable, memory or table cell, enclosed in curly
      brackets.</p>

      <a id="indirect_accessing"></a>
      <h2>Indirect adressing of NamedBeans</h2>

      <p>In some cases, it may be useful to use indirect addressing of NamedBeans.</p>

      <p>This can be done in two ways:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Using a Memory that has the name of the NamedBean</li>

        <li>Using a Table to lookup the name of the NamedBean</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Using a Memory that has the name of the NamedBean</p>

      <p>Lets say we have a Turnout action that should throw a particulat turnout. But we wnat to
      be able to select which turnout to throw at a later time. We can solve that by storing the
      system name or user name in a Memory. We then tell the Turnout action to read the Memory and
      lookup the turnout on the fly.</p>

      <p>Since LogixNG fully supports string manipulation and calculations of both integers and
      floating point values, where are plenty of possibilities here.</p>
      <a id="ListenOnBeans"></a>
      <h3>Listen on beans</h3>

      <p>There is one major drawback with this. Since LogixNG doesn't know in advance which
      NamedBeans (turnouts, sensors, etc.) will be accessed indirectly, it's not possible for
      LogixNG to automaticly register listeners to the named beans that should trigger on change.
      For example, a Turnout expression registers a listener on the turnout, if the name of the
      turnout is given, but if the Turnout expression is using indirect addressing of the turnout,
      it's not able to do that.</p>

      <p>The solution is to use the <strong>Listen on beans</strong> action and tell this action
      which beans to listen on. Any time any property of any of the named beans this action listens
      to changes, the ConditionalNG will be executed.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/chapter7/listen_on_beans_dialog.png"><img src=
        "images/chapter7/listen_on_beans_dialog.png" alt="LogixNG listen on beans dialog"
        width="35%" height="35%"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The <strong>Add reference</strong> button is used to add beans to the the list.  For each
      bean select the bean type, the bean name from the drop down list and whether the standard
      events for the selected bean should be monitored or if all of the events are monitored.</p>

      <p>There are three optional fields for specifying local variables that will contain the name
      of the bean, the event type and the new value.  For example, a sensor has a <strong>KnownState
      </strong> event with the new value being 2 (Active) or 4 (Inactive).</p>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <p>A ConditionalNG is using turnouts IT1, IT2, IT3, IT4 and IT5 in it's expressions and wants
      each of them to trigger on change. Turnouts IT1 and IT3 and IT4 are directly accessed in
      expressions and IT2 and IT5 are indirect accessed.</p>

      <p>Each turnout that is directly addressed in an expression will have the ConditionalNG
      listen to automatically, so IT1, IT3 and IT4 will be listend to. But in order to listen on
      turnouts IT2 and IT5, the <strong>Listen on beans</strong> action needs to be used.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Listen on beans</strong> action can be placed anythere in the ConditionalNG
      tree, as long as it and its parents are enabled. If you disable this action, or any of its
      parent actions, the <strong>Listen on beans</strong> action will not listen on its named
      beans.</p>
