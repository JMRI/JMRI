      <h3>Expression dialogs</h3>

      <p>When the category and type has been selected, the detail expression dialog will be
      displayed. The content of the dialog will vary depending on the category and type. The
      typical digital expression item dialog is described below.</p>

      <p>The dialog for adding and editing expressions consists of an upper part that contains the
      item and the states for that item. The lower part is common to all expresssions.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <a href="images/chapter6/typical_expression.png"><img src=
        "images/chapter6/typical_expression.png" alt="Chapter 6 typical expression"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The <strong>Edit</strong> screen is the same except for the title, the Create button and
      the current content will be in the fields.</p>

      <p>The left section is normally used to select the item, such as a turnout or a sensor. The
      right section is the state to be checked. The center section will normally have a <strong>is
      / is not</strong> combo box. The default mode will be to use the <strong>Direct</strong>
      tabs.</p>

      <p>See <a href="chapter7.shtml">Reference</a>, <a href="chapter8.shtml">Local Variable</a>
      and <a href="chapter9.shtml">Formula</a> for details about the other tabs.</p>

      <p>The lower section contains a standard set of items</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Error Handling</dt>

        <dd>
          If <strong>Use default</strong> is selected, the value in <a href=
          "../LogixNG.shtml#preferences">Preference</a> will be used. For other options see
          <a href="../ErrorHandling.shtml">error handling</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Catch "Abort execution"</dt>

        <dd>If the error handling (see previous) for any child node is set to <strong>Abort
        execution</strong>, a parent node should have this option checked. This lets the parent
        node handle the error.</dd>

        <dt>Listen</dt>

        <dd>Normally, any change to an expression item should trigger the true/false evaluation.
        Sometimes an expression item should participate in the evaluation but not trigger it. The
        Listen checkbox is used to control the trigger state.</dd>

        <dt>Edit comment</dt>

        <dd>Each expression can have a comment. The comment dialog has a multiline text area. Click
        <strong>OK</strong> to save the comment.</dd>

        <dt>Formula functions</dt>

        <dd>
          These are explained in the <a href="chapter9.shtml">Formula</a> chapter.
        </dd>

        <dt>Cancel</dt>

        <dd>Close the dialog without applying any changes.</dd>

        <dt>Create/OK</dt>

        <dd>Save the new expression or the changes to an existing expression.</dd>

      </dl>

      <h5>Audio<span class="since">since 5.5.4</span></h5>

      <p>Returns true if the selected audio object has the indicated state.  The drop-down list
      contains the defined audio listeners and audio sources.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">

        "images/chapter6/digital_expression_audio.png" alt="Chapter 6 expression audio item"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The <strong>Check only on change</strong> option is used to change the logic of the
      expression evaluation.  When the option is not enabled, the normal evaluation occurs:
      <strong><em>Does the current state match the indicated state</em></strong>.  When the option
      is enabled, the evaluation becomes:  <strong><em>Has the current state changed to the indicated
      state since the last check</em></strong>.

      <h5>Block</h5>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Occupied:</strong> Evaluate to true if the sensor assigned to the block is
        active.</li>

        <li><strong>not Occupied:</strong> Evaluate to true if the sensor assigned to the block is
        inactive.</li>

        <li><strong>some other state:</strong> Evaluate to true if the state is unknown,
        inconsistent or undetected.</li>

        <li><strong>Allocated:</strong> Evaluate to true if the related layout block has use extra
        color enabled.</li>

        <li><strong>equal to:</strong> Evaluate to true if the value of the block matches a string
        value or a reference value, which is typically a memory variable.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h5>Clock</h5>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fast clock:</strong> Evaluate to true if the fast clock time is between two
        hh:mm values.</li>

        <li><strong>System clock:</strong> Evaluate to true if the system clock time is between two
        hh:mm values.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h5>Conditional</h5>

      <p>If the conditional named is used in more than one Logix, the results are
      unpredictable.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>False:</strong> Evaluate to true if the state of the specified conditional is
        false.</li>

        <li><strong>True:</strong> Evaluate to true if the state of the specified conditional is
        true.</li>

        <li><strong>Other:</strong> Evaluate to true if the state of the specified conditional is
        unknown or inconsistent.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h5>Dispatcher</h5>

      <p>A Dispatcher train only exists from the time it is created until it is terminated.
      LogixNG uses the Dispatcher TrainInfo file to refer to a potential Dispatcher train.
      See the <em>Saving and Retrieving Active Train Information</em> section at
      <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/NewTrain.shtml">
      Activate New Train</a>.  The train is started using the LogixNG Dispatcher
      <em>Load train from train info file</em> Action.  If the related train does not exist when
      the expression is evaluated, the result will be false. That means a false result is either
      actually false or the train does not exist.</p>

      <p>Train Mode:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automatic</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Dispatched</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Manual</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Train Status:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Running</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Paused</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Waiting</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Working</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Ready</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Stopped</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Done</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h5 id="EntryExitExpressions">Entry/Exit</h5>

      <p>Evaluate if an Entry/Exit pair has a specified state.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <a href="images/chapter6/entryexit_expression.png"><img src=
        "images/chapter6/entryexit_expression.png" alt="Chapter 6 entryexit expression"></a>
      </div>

      <dl>
        <dt>Inactive</dt>
        <dd>Evaluate to true if the state of the specified entry/exit pair is inactive.</dd>

        <dt>Other</dt>
        <dd>Evaluate to true if the state of the specified entry/exit pair is unknown or inconsistent.</dd>

        <dt>Reversed</dt>
        <dd>Evaluate to true if the specified entry/exit pair is <strong>active</strong> and
        <strong>reversed</strong>.  A <strong>reversed</strong> route occurs when the sensors for a
        <strong>bidirectional</strong> entry/exit pair are selected in the reverse order.  The
        evaluation is triggered by a change to the active/inactive state of the entry/exit pair.</dd>

        <dt>Bidirectional</dt>
        <dd>Evaluate to true if the specified entry/exit pair has the <strong>Both Way</strong>
        option enabled in the entry/exit pair table.  The evaluation is triggered by a change to
        the active/inactive state of the entry/exit pair.  Changes to the Both Way option do not
        trigger evaluation.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h5>Local variable</h5>

      <p>Compares the value of the specified local variable to either a string, a memory variable,
      another local variable or a table cell. See <a href="chapter11.shtml#tableCellSelection">
      Simplified Table Cell Reference</a> for details on defining the table cell.  Evaluates to true
      if the comparison is true.</p>

      <h5>Memory</h5>

      <p>Compares the value of the specified memory variable to either a string, another memory,
      variable, a local variable or a table cell. See <a href="chapter11.shtml#tableCellSelection">
      Simplified Table Cell Reference</a> for details on defining the table cell. Evaluates to true

        occupied in Logix).</li>

        <li><strong>OutOfService:</strong> Evaluate to true if the specified oblock is out of
        service.</li>

        <li><strong>Dark:</strong> Evaluate to true if the specified oblock is dark.</li>

        <li><strong>TrackError:</strong> Evaluate to true if the specified oblock has a track error
        (is power error in Logix).</li>

      <h5>Power</h5>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>On:</strong> Evaluate to true if the power state is on.</li>

        <li><strong>Off:</strong> Evaluate to true if the power state is off.</li>

        <li><strong>Idle:</strong> Evaluate to true if the power state is idle.<span class="since">

        <li><strong>Unknown:</strong> Evaluate to true if the power state is unknown.</li>

        <li><strong>On or Off:</strong> Evaluate to true if the power state is on or
        off.  Previously this was the <strong>Other</strong> state.<span class="since">since 5.1.6</span></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <strong>Ignore unknown state</strong> option is used to bypass the the unknown state.
      This can occur when transitioning between the <strong>on</strong> and <strong>off</strong>
      states.</p>

      <h5>Reference</h5>

      <p>If there is a possibility that a <a href="chapter7.shtml">reference</a> will refer to an
      item that does not exist or it is the wrong item type, the Reference expression can test that
      case and return true or false.</p>

      <p>An example would be a <a href="chapter11.shtml">table</a> that has optional cells. A table
      for a staging yard ladder will have a variable number of turnouts based on the selected
      track.</p>

      <p>Enter the reference to be checked and specify the type.</p>

      <h5>Reporter</h5>

      <p>Compare the content of one of the three Reporter data fields to a string, a memory variable
      or a local variable.  See the <strong>Memory</strong> description for a list of the
      comparisons.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Current Report:</strong> The current value unless the hardware says there is
        nothing to report.  In that case the value will be null.</li>

        <li><strong>Last Report:</strong> Normally the current report and last report are the same.
        If the current report is null, this will be most recent valid report.  If no report has ever
        been received, this will be null.</li>

        <li><strong>State:</strong> A number that represents the last report.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note:  The meaning of the reports and the state number are defined by originating
      hardware.</p>

      <h5 id="script">Script</h5>

      <p>A script expression calls a Jython or ECMAScript script. The script context contains a
      <strong>result</strong> boolean object. When the script is done, it does a
      <code>result.setValue(x)</code> where x is, or evaluates to, True or False.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
        <a href="images/chapter6/digital_expression_script.png">
        <img src="images/chapter6/digital_expression_script.png" alt="Chapter 6 digital expression script"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The Register listener and Unregister listener options are used if the script is to run
      based on some other JMRI event.  For example, the following register command will
      cause the script to be run every fast minute.</p>

      <code>memories.getMemory('IMCURRENTTIME').addPropertyChangeListener('value', self)</code>

      <p>Select the type of script. The supported script types are <strong>Jython Files</strong>
      and <strong>ECMAScript Files</strong>.</p>

      <p>For details on accessing LogixNG objects from a script see <a href="chapter13.shtml">
      Chapter 13 - Jython Scripting Support</a>.</p>

      <h5>Antecedent</h5>

      <p>The Antecedent expression is mainly included to make import from Logix to LogixNG simple.
      It works exactly as Antecedent in Logix. It has a number of child expressions and an
      antecedent that defines how the evaluation of the expressions should be done. Each child
      expression is referenced in the antecedent by R1, R2, R3, ..., there R1 is the first child
      expression, R2 is the second child expression, and so on. Note that this differs from other
      expressions in LogixNG. Other LogixNG expressions use the socket name, but since the
      Antecedent expression is included to work as Antecedent works in Logix, the antecedent has
      been kept from Logix Antecedent as well. <em>Note: Antecedent is included for compability
      with Logix but it's recommended to use Formula instead. Formula is much more powerful, uses
      the socket names and also works with numbers and strings.</em></p>

      <h5 id="digital_formula">Digital Formula</h5>

      <p>Formula is the next generation of Antecedent. It supports many operators, like ==, !=,
      &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt;, &gt;, +, -, *, / and %. It supports local variables, memories and
      functions. It supports all the types of expressions, digital, analog and string expressions.

      <p>This can be used to determine whether JMRI is using a real layout connection or a simulated

      <h5 id="fileasflag">File as flag<span class="since">since 5.5.2</span></h5>

      <p>The <strong>File as flag</strong> expression checks for the existence of a file.  If the
      file exists, the expression returns <strong>true</strong>, otherwise it returns <strong>false
      </strong>.  When the file is found, it can be kept or deleted.  Normally the file will be
      created by some process that needs to notify JMRI about an event.  For Linux and macOS,
      <strong><code>touch <em>filename</em></code></strong> works from the command line or a script.
      The are several options for Windows, such as
      <strong><code>copy nul <em>filename</em></code></strong>,
      <strong><code>type nul > <em>filename</em></code></strong>, or
      <strong><code>echo > <em>filename</em></code></strong>.</p>

      </div>

      <p>The file selector is used to create the path to the file and file name.  The
      default path is the <strong>user files location</strong>.  If the file does not
      currently exist, select a different file and then replace the file name with the
      planned file name before creating the expression.</p>

      <p>The default file action when the file is found is <strong>Keep file</strong>.  The
      <strong>Delete file</strong> action can be selected which would be useful for
      repetitive external events.</p>

      <p><strong><u>Example</u></strong></p>

      <p>The LogixNG <a href="chapter5.shtml#timeraction">Timer</a> action is used to
      run the <strong>File as flag</strong> expresson every 5 seconds.  When the file
      exists, an internal sensor is set <strong>Active</strong>.  The file is deleted and
      the timer loop resumes running <strong>File as flag</strong>.  The sensor is used
      to trigger another process which handles the event.  For simple actions,
      <strong>Then</strong> could be used to do the work.</p>
