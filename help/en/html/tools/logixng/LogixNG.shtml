      <h1>JMRI: LogixNG:  The Next Generation of Layout Automation</h1>

      <h2>Introduction to LogixNG</h2>

      <p>LogixNG (Logix "Next Generation") is a modular layout automation tool developed for JMRI in
      2018 - 2021.  It is similar to, but a complete rethinking of, <a href="../Logix.shtml">Logix</a>.  It
      is designed to be easily testable, highly maintainable and readily expandable.  Key concepts
      of LogixNG are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Actions and Expressions</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The main building blocks in LogixNG are <em>actions</em> and <em>expressions</em>. An
          action does something, for example throwing a turnout, setting a signal, or running a
          script. An expression asks a question, for example if turnout LT2 is closed, if sensor
          IS255 is active, or does an expression script return true or false.</p>

          <p>The actions and expressions are organized as trees; each tree is a <strong>ConditionalNG
          </strong>.  A LogixNG is comprised of one or more ConditionalNGs. Although Logix does not
          have the "tree" concept, there is a similarity: In LogixNG, a <em>ConditionalNG</em>
          serves the same purpose as a <em>Conditional</em> in Logix.  An <em>expression</em> in
          LogixNG is similar to a <em>conditional variable</em> in Logix, and an <em>action</em> in
          LogixNG is similar to a <em>conditional action</em> in Logix.</p>

          <p>In LogixNG, an action or expression may have other actions and/or expressions as
          children, which allows the user to build a complex structure with simple building blocks.
          </p>

          <p>For example, one common root of the tree is the <strong>If Then Else</strong> action.
          It has one child expression and two child actions. It evaluates the expression and if the
          expression is <strong>true</strong>, the <strong><em>then</em></strong> child action is
          executed. If the expression is <strong>false</strong>, the <strong><em>else</em></strong>
          child action is executed.
          </p>
        </dd>


        <dt>Modules</dt>

        <dd><p>The LogixNG <strong>Module</strong> is essentially a ConditionalNG, but there are
        different types with specific capabilities. This makes it possible to combine common
        expressions and actions. Modules can accept parameters and return results. When combined
        with <strong>references</strong> and <strong>tables</strong>, modules make it possible to
        create templates/subroutines/etc., that can be called from ConditionalNGs with the
        appropriate variables.</p></dd>

        <dt>Tables</dt>

        <dd><p>LogixNG adds the <strong>LogixNG Tables</strong> concept to JMRI. A LogixNG Table is
        similar to <a href="../Memories.shtml">Memory</a> but has one or two dimensions. Each row and
        each column in the table may be given a name, which means that a single cell in the table
        can be referred to with the row name and the column name. Tables are in particular intended
        to be used together with references, to make it easy to setup complex configurations. A
        table can be created in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc and
        then exported as a CSV file and imported to JMRI.</p></dd>

        <dt>References</dt>

        <dd><p>Like the Logix indirect memory reference using @memoryname, LogixNG has references. A
        reference is an indirect pointer to an item on the layout. For example, if the memory IM1
        has the value "IT1", the reference {IM1} points to the turnout IT1. This means that if an
        action has the command "set turnout {IM1} to thrown", it means that LogixNG reads the memory
        IM1, which in this example has the value IT1, and then sets the turnout IT1 to thrown.</p></dd>

        <dt>Error Handling</dt>

        <dd><p>LogixNG provides error handling and debugging tools to help you in creating
        sophisticated layout automation logic.  This includes the ability to stop or abort
        individual LogixNGs, log errors, and "throw" an exception for further analysis.  See
        <a href="ErrorHandling.shtml">Error Handling</a></p></dd>

        <dt>Threads</dt>

        <dd>LogixNG runs in its own Java thread.  This reduces conflicts between LogixNG processes
        and the rest of the JMRI.  Two threads are always present.  The first
        is for normal LogixNG actions and the second is used for the LogixNG debugger.  When the
        debugger is used in single step mode, the thread is stopped.  By running the ConditionalNG
        in the debugger thread, other LogixNG processing is not affected.  For additional information
        on using threads, see
        <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/logixng/LogixNGTableEditor.shtml#EditThreads">
        ConditionalNG Threads</a>.</dd>

        </dl>


      <h2>LogixNG Components</h2>

      <p>The LogixNG tool has three main components. They are accessed via the main PanelPro
      <strong>Tools &rArr; Tables &rArr; LogixNG</strong> menu path like other JMRI table items. The three
      LogixNG tables and related content will be <strong><em>loaded</em></strong> and
      <strong><em>stored</em></strong> along with all of the other tables and panels.
      <em><strong>Note:</strong> The only content not stored are the CSV files used for
      tables.</em></p>

      <p>The links in the following section, along with the links in the sidebar, are the task
      specific help pages that are also referenced using JMRI <strong>Help &rArr; Window
      Help</strong>.</p>

      <h3>LogixNGs and ConditionalNGs</h3>

      <p>The <strong>LogixNGs</strong> menu item displays a list of LogixNGs. When a LogixNG item
      is selected, the ConditionalNG list is displayed. Clicking on the Edit button will open the
      ConditionalNG editor. This window contains a tree of the items that have been added to the
      conditional. The primary items are the expressions which act like if statements and actions
      to be performed. For details, see the following pages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LogixNGTable.shtml">LogixNG Table</a>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Modules</h3>

      <p>The <strong>LogixNG Modules</strong> menu item displays a list of modules. A module is
      similar to a ConditionalNG in that it also uses the tree based editor. The major difference
      is that information can be passed to a module and it can return results. For details, see the
      following pages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tables</h3>

      <p>The <strong>LogixNG Tables</strong> menu item displays a list of tables. The table feature
      was described in the introduction. For details, see the following pages:</p>

      <ul>

        <dt>Start LogixNGs on load</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If checked, the <strong>enabled</strong> LogixNG definitions will be active after the
          completion of the PanelPro xml data file loading. If not checked, the LogixNGs will be
          inactive until <strong>Tools &rArr; LogixNG &rArr; Start LogixNG</strong> is selected.
          The default setting is checked.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Install Debugger</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>LogixNG has a built in debugger. This option needs to be enabled during start up for the
          debugger to work. See <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/logixng/ConditionalNGDebugger.shtml">
          LogixNG Debugger</a> for information about the debugger.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Log all before</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The debugger is extended to display the LogixNG statement that is about to be executed.
          The statement is displayed on the JMRI system console.
          See <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/logixng/ConditionalNGDebugger.shtml#logging">
          LogixNG Debugger</a> for information about debugger logging.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Log all after</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The debugger is extended to display the LogixNG statement after it has been executed.
          For expressions, the true/false result is included. The statement is displayed on the JMRI
          system console.
          See <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/logixng/ConditionalNGDebugger.shtml#logging">

        <dt>Show system names and user names</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The LogixNG expressions and actions have names. These names are used internally by
          LogixNG. In certain developer situations, making the names visible can be helpful. The
          default is unchecked.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Highlight row in ConditionalNG editor</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>When this option is enabled, the currently selected row will be highlighted.  This can
          provide visual feedback, such as when the popup menu is open.</p>

          <p><span class="since">since 5.1.5</span>The arrow keys can be used to move between rows
          and shortcut keys are available to perform menu items without opening the context menu.</p>

          <p>For macOS, use Cmd instead of Ctrl.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Use strict typing of global variables / Use strict typing of local variables
        <span class="since">since 5.7.4</span></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Strict variable typing can be selected for global and/or local variables.  The default
          is that strict variable typing is not enabled for either.</p>

          <p>When strict typing is enabled, variables that are are assigned the <strong>Boolean</strong>,
          <strong>String</strong>, <strong>Integer</strong> or <strong>Floating number</strong> type
          cannot be set to a value of another type. LogixNG will try to convert the new value to the
          desired type, for example a local variable of type floating number will be assigned the
          value 12.0 if it's assigned 12 and it will be assigned the value 32.5 if it's assigned the
          string "32.5".</p>

          <p>Local and global variables that are assigned any of the other variable types are not affected.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Show system names in exceptions<span class="since">since 5.1.6</span></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>When this option is enabled, the system name of the LogixNG item will be included in the
          exception dialog.  This will help with finding the LogixNG and ConditionalNG that created
          the error.  A related change to the LogixNG browser is the option to include the system
          name on the browser report.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Error Handling Options</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>LogixNG has robust error handling. The combo box selection provides the default setting.
          Individual expressions and actions can override the default setting. For details, see
          <a href="ErrorHandling.shtml">Error Handling</a></p>
        </dd>

        <dt>If Then Else &mdash; Default execution<span class="since">since 5.7.4</span></dt>

        <dd>
          When the <strong>If Then Else</strong> action is added, the execution mode is set to
          <strong>Execute on change</strong>. The default can be changed to <strong>Always execute</strong>.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2 id="tools">LogixNG Tools</h2>

      <p>LogixNG has six system level tools at <strong>Tools &rArr; LogixNG</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Start LogixNG</strong> and <strong>Stop LogixNG</strong> are used to control the
      processing of LogixNG ConditionalNG definitions. When LogixNG is <strong>active</strong> ,
      then the <strong>enabled</strong> LogixNGs will run its ConditionalNGs.
      <strong>Note:</strong> The execution of currently running ConditionalNGs doesn't stop
      immediately when "Stop LogixNG" is selected. The ConditionalNGs will continue to run until
      they are finished, but they will not be restarted after "Stop LogixNG" is selected.</p>

      <p>The LogixNGs included in the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/logixng/LogixNGInitializationTable.shtml">LogixNG initialization
      table</a> are run before the rest of the LogixNGs. This is the similar to the Logix
      RTXINITIALIZER.</p>

      <p>Logix definitions can be be imported into LogixNG using <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/logixng/LogixImport.shtml">Import Logix</a>.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Inline LogixNG</strong> tool displays the LogixNG definitions that have been
      attached to panel items.  For details, see
      <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/logixng/InlineLogixNG.shtml">Inline LogixNG</a>.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Where Used</strong> tool displays the LogixNG definitions that have references
      to JMRI table items.  For details, see
      <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/logixng/LogixNGWhereUsed.shtml">LogixNG Where used</a>.</p>

      <h2>Documentation</h2>

      <p>This document is an introduction and overview of LogixNG. The sidebar contains links to
      the task specific help files used by JMRI. The detailed documentation is in the <a href=
      "reference/index.shtml">reference</a>.</p>

      <p>The reference has two sections. The <strong>Standard Features</strong> section covers the
      LogixNG components that are similar to Logix. The <strong>Advance Features</strong> section
      covers new features that did not exist in Logix or were incomplete.</p>

      <h2 id="disable">Disabling LogixNG during PanelPro start up</h2>

      <p>In addition to the preference settings and the LogixNG tools, it is possible to disable
      LogixNG during PanelPro startup.  This can be necessary if there is a bad logic that locks up
      PanelPro immediately after file loading.</p>

      <p>When the PanelPro startup splash dialog is displayed, press <strong>F8</strong> or
      <strong>F9</strong>.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="../../setup/images/StartDialog.png"><img src="../../setup/images/StartDialog.png" alt=
        "PanelPro startup dialog"></a>
      </div>

      <p>If <strong>F8</strong> is selected <strong><em>and</em></strong> a layout data xml file is
      being loaded using a start up action, the LogixNG table entries will be disabled. The F8 key
      has no impact when a file is loaded using <strong>File &rArr; Load table content and panels...
      </strong>.  In this case, use <strong>Tools &rArr; LogixNG &rArr; Stop LogixNG</strong>
      before loading the file.</p>

      <p>If <strong>F9</strong> is selected, LogixNG will not start after layout data file loading
      is done, whether as a start up action or manually.  The LogixNG table entries will be
      enabled/disabled based on their state in the xml file.  When the problem has been resolved then
      <strong>Tools &rArr; LogixNG &rArr; Start LogixNG</strong> can be used to activate LogixNG
      processing.</p>

      <h2>Sample</h2>

      <p>This is a sample layout with LogixNG controlling the turnouts. The turnout sensors toggle
      the turnout state when clicked, unless the lock sensors are active</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/sample_panel.png"><img src="images/sample_panel.png" alt=
        "LogixNG sample panel"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The logic uses a table to identify the turnouts, the toggle sensors and the lock
      sensors.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/sample_table.png"><img src="images/sample_table.png" alt=
        "LogixNG sample table"></a>
      </div>

      <p>Each turnout has a ConditionalNG that is triggered when the toggle sensor changes state.
      If the sensor goes Active, a module is called to check the lock state and toggle the turnout.
      A variable is passed to the module that has the row number.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/sample_logixng.png"><img src="images/sample_logixng.png" alt=
        "LogixNG sample logixng"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The module checks the lock sensor based on the row number and if ok, toggles the turnout
      state.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/sample_module.png"><img src="images/sample_module.png" alt=
        "LogixNG sample module"></a>
      </div>

      <p>An initialization LogixNG is used to set the initial sensor and turnout states. This
      LogixNG is also triggered by the Reset sensor.</p>
