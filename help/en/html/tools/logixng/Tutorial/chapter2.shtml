      <h1>LogixNG Tutorial - Chapter 2</h1>

      <h2>The clipboard</h2>

        <h3>Cut/Copy/Paste</h3>

          <p>While editing a ConditionalNG, it can be useful to <strong>cut</strong> out
          something, edit something else, and then <strong>paste</strong> it back.
          Chapter 1 has a good example.  For this purpose, LogixNG has a clipboard. Each
          time you cut an action or expression, it is moved to the clipboard.</p>

          <p>It also possible to <strong>copy</strong> all or part of a ConditionalNG.  This
          can then be pasted into the same ConditionalNG, another ConditionalNG or even a
          different LogixNG.</p>

        <h3>Working with the clipboard</h3>

          <p>The clipboard editor works the same way as the ConditionalNG editor, with the
          exception that actions and expressions are never active while on the clipboard.</p>

          The clipboard contents are visible by selecting <strong>Tools &rArr; Open clipboard</strong>.

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
          <a href="images/chapter2/chapter2_clipboard.png">
          <img src="images/chapter2/chapter2_clipboard.png"
          alt="Chapter 2 clipboard" width="500" height="305">
          </a>
          </div>

          <p>In the ConditionalNG editor window, copy and cut add to the beginning of the
          clipboard list.  Paste uses the <strong><em>first</em></strong> item in the
          clipboard list and it will be <strong>deleted</strong> from clipboard list.</p>

          <p>In the clipboard window, copy creates a <strong>duplicate</strong> item and
          adds it to the beginning of the list.  Cut <strong>moves</strong> the item to
          the beginning of the list.  <strong>Remove</strong> will <strong>delete</strong>
          the item from the clipboard list.</p>

          <p>Note that you can cut an item on any level in the clipboard tree. While
          editing a ConditionalNG, you may cut a big tree from the ConditionalNG and you
          then take only a small sub tree and paste back to the ConditionalNG.</p>

<pre>
Example:
* Many
  * IfThenElse
    * If sensor
    * Then Throw turnout
</pre>

          <p>You can cut the Many action from the ConditionalNG, then go to the clipboard
          and expand the Many action and then cut the IfThenElse action. The IfThenElse
          action will then be moved to the first row on the clipboard. Now you can go back
          to the ConditionalNG and paste the IfThenElse action to the ConditionalNG.</p>

          <p>If the popup menu is opened on an item that can be copied, the menu item Copy
          is enabled. If "Copy" is selected, the item and its sub tree are copied to the
          clipboard. Each item gets an auto system name and no user name.</p>
