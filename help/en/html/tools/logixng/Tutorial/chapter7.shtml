      <h2>References</h2>

      <p>The following discussion refers to {name}.  This can be either a JMRI memory variable
      or a LogixNG Local Variable.</p>


      <p>LogixNG can use references to access layout items like turnouts in an indirect
      way. It's done by entering the system name or user name in curly brackets. If
      a turnout action has the turnout IT1, it will access that turnout directly. But if
      the turnout action has the turnout {IM2}, it will read that memory and if that
      memory has a string as a value, it will use that string value to find the turnout.
      So if the memory IM2 has the value IT5, and the turnout action has the turnout
      {IM2}, the turnout action will read the memory IM2 and find out that it points to
      the turnout IT5 and therefore do it's action on turnout IT5. The benefit of this
      is that the Memory can be changed during execution and therefore the same
      turnout action can be used to access different turnouts at different times.</p>

      <p>It's possible to use indirect access recursive. If a turnout action has the
      turnout {IM5}, and that Memory has the value {IM14}, and that the Memory IM14
      has the value IT3, the turnout action will access IT3. The turnout action has an
      indirect turnout IM5 so it will read that Memory. And since that memory has the
      value {IM14} which also is an indirect access, it will read the memory IM14 and
      find out that it has the value IT3, and therefore use IT3. This is also true for
      tables. If the cell IQT1[5,3] has the value '{IM3}', and the memory IM3 has the
      value 'IT5', the cell IQT1[5,3] will point to IT5.</p>

      <p>When the Reference tab is selected, the appropriate values are entered into the text
      field.  References are the name of a local variable, memory or table cell, enclosed
      in curly brackets.</p>

          <tr>
            <td>{My table[North yard, {Turnout selection}]}</td>
            <td>Same as above except the column name comes from a reference</td>
            <td></td>

          <tr>
            <td>{{TableName}[North yard, Left turnout]}</td>
            <td>The table name comes from a reference, which becomes a reference</td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>{{TableName}[{Yard}, {Turnout selection}]}</td>
            <td>Everything comes from a reference, which becomes a reference</td>
