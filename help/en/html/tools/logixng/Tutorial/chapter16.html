<h1>LogixNG Tutorial - Chapter 16</h1>

<h2>Preferences</h2>

LogixNG has some global preferences that can be set. See <strong>Preferences &rArr; LogixNG</strong>.

<p>

<h3>Start LogixNGs on load</h3>

If this checkbox is selected, LogixNG will start when when the LogixNG is loaded, either by loading a panel or when
some other part of JMRI creates a LogixNG. If this checkbox is not selected, the LogixNGs will not start until the
user select menu item <strong>Tools &rArr; LogixNG &rArr; Start LogixNG</strong> on the main menu.
<p>
This option is useful to turn off if you have trouble with a LogixNG that gets triggered once the panel is loaded. It
allows you to load the panel and edit the ConditionalNG.
<p>
If you want to debug a ConditionalNG that gets triggered once the panel is loaded, you can turn this option off, load
the panel, open the debugger, and then start LogixNG. This allows you to open the debugger before the ConditionalNG is
triggered.


<h3>Install debugger</h3>

If this checkbox is selected, the debugger is installed when JMRI is started. If this checkbox is changed, you need to
restart JMRI for the changes to take effect.
<p>
Most users would want to have this option selected. But if you have a huge LogixNG setup with a lot of ConditionalNGs
with a lot of actions and expressions, and you are running JMRI on a small computer with low CPU or low memory, this
might be useful since the debugger adds some overhead. But unless needed, this option is recommended to be selected.
