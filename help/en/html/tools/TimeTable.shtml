      <h1>Timetable</h1>

      <p>A timetable describes the timing of trains running on a railroad.  This
      information is used by train crews and dispatchers to prevent collisions.
      This also applies to model railroads, especially those using timetable and
      train order dispatching.</p>

      This tool provides the ability to collect the required data and generate
      a timetable graph that can be used to optimize train timing, such scheduling
      meets.

      </a>
      </div>

      <p>The window is divided into 3 sections.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The left side of the main section contains the tree structure for
      all of the layouts and the related data.  The tree can
      expand and collapse to control the amount of detail being displayed.</li>
      <li>The right side of the main section contains the detail information,
      if any, about the currently selected tree row.</li>
      <li>The right side of bottom section contains the <strong>Save</strong>
      and <strong>Done</strong> buttons.  The left side contains the
      <strong>Action</strong> buttons.  These buttons vary depending on the
      selected tree row.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Action Buttons</h3>

      <h3>The Edit Process</h3>
      <p>When the Timetable tool is selected from the PanelPro Tools menu,
      the timetable data is loaded from the <strong>TimeTableData.xml</strong>
      file.  The file is located in the <strong>timetable</strong> directory in the
      user files location.  If the file does not exist, a <strong>Sample</strong>
      timetable is copied from the JMRI install location.</p>

      <p>When a new node is added, it is created with default values, and the
      new node is automatically selected.  The default name should be changed
      and the other default values should be reviewed.</p>

      <p>When a tree node is selected, the detail section shows the current
      detail information.  The field labels include tooltips.  When a field is
      clicked on or changed, the <strong>Cancel</strong> and <strong>Update</strong>
      buttons become active and the Action buttons become inactive.  When edit
      mode is enabled, selecting a different tree node is disabled until Cancel or
      Update is selected.  A dialog will be displayed as a reminder.</p>

      </div>

      <p>If the <strong>Save</strong> button is active, there are changes that
      have not been saved.  Select the button to save the changes.  Four backup
      files are retained in the timetable directory.</p>

      <p>Select the <strong>Done</strong> button to close the Timetable window. If
      there are pending changes to be saved, a dialog will be displayed.</p>

        <a name="layout" id="layout"></a>
        <h3>Layout</h3>
        <p>The Layout item contains global information.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Layout name &mdash; The layout name.</li>
            <li>Scale &mdash; The layout scale.  The default is HO</li>
            <li>Fast clock speed &mdash; The speed of the fast clock, e.g. 4:1,
            is entered as 4.</li>
            <li>Throttles &mdash; The number of the throttles for the throttle
            section of the graph. Optional.</li>
            <li>Metric &mdash; Indicate if distances are metric based.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>The scale is combined with the fast clock speed and the metric
        indication to calculate the scale mile or scale kilometer.  The
        resulting "smile/skm" is displayed at the bottom.</p>

        <a name="type" id="type"></a>
        <h3>Train Type</h3>
        <p>The train type contains a color that will be used for the train graph.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Type name &mdash; The train type name, such as Passenger, Thru
            Freight, etc.</li>
            <li>Color &mdash; The color is selected using a split selector.
            Click on the color swatch to get the full color chooser or the
            arrow to get a list of current and standard colors.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>The colors help differentiate types or classes of trains.
        </p>

        <a name="segment" id="segment"></a>
        <h3>Segment</h3>
        <p>Each layout requires at least one segment.  Large layouts may have
        sub-divisions with each sub-division using its own segment.</p>
        <p>When a segment is selected, the Graph <strong>Display</strong> and
        <strong>Print</strong> action buttons are added.  Select the Display or
        Print button to display the train <a href="#graph">graph</a>.
        If more than one schedule is defined, a dialog will request the schedule name.</p>

        <a name="station" id="station"></a>
        <h3>Station</h3>
        <p>A "station" occurs any place a train can stop or an arrival/departure
        time is desired.  The first station in a segment will have a distance of zero.
        The remaining stations will have the cumulative distance.  The distance
        is measured in feet or meters depending on the layout metric setting.  When
        multiple segments are being used, the first station of a secondary segment
        will have the <strong>SAME</strong> station name as the mainline station.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Station name &mdash; The name of the station.</li>
            <li>Distance &mdash; The cumulative distance in feet or meters from
            the beginning of the segment.</li>
            <li>Double track &mdash; Set if a double (or more) track line.</li>
            <li>Sidings &mdash; The number of siding tracks at this station.</li>
            <li>Staging &mdash; The number of staging tracks when the station is
            a staging yard.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>The double track, sidings and staging fields provide documentation that
        may be useful.
        </p>

        <a name="schedule" id="schedule"></a>
        <h3>Schedule</h3>
        <p>The schedule defines time frame for the timetable.</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Schedule name &mdash; The name of the schedule, such as #28.</li>
           <li>Effective date &mdash; The date the schedule takes effect.  This
           is a free format field and is only used on the graph.</li>
           <li>Start hour &mdash; The start hour is limited to 0 thru 23.</li>
           <li>Duration &mdash; The duration can be from 1 to 24 hours.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>if the duration is less than 24 hours, then trains will be restricted to
          running within the specified time frame.
        </p>

        <a name="train" id="train"></a>
        <h3>Train</h3>
        <p>The train item provides required information for the timetable and
        optional descriptive data.</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Train name &mdash; This is usually a short name, or symbol,
           for the train.</li>
           <li>Description &mdash; This is a more descriptive name for the train.</li>
           <li>Type &mdash; The train type is selected from the train type list
           defined earlier.</li>
           <li>Default speed &mdash; The default speed is used when the next
           speed for a stop is set to zero.</li>
           <li>Start time &mdash; The start time using hh:mm.</li>
           <li>Throttle &mdash; The assigned throttle if using the throttles
           feature.</li>
           <li>Notes &mdash; Additional information about the train, such as
           special handling.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>The calculated duration for the train is also displayed.
        </p>

        <a name="stop" id="stop"></a>
        <h3>Stop</h3>
        <p>A stop occurs whenever a train has to perform some action or the
        timetable needs to display the time a train passes a location.</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Station &mdash; The selected station for this Stop.  The
           station selection drop down displays both the segment name and
           the station name.</li>
           <li>Duration &mdash; The number of minutes that the train will
           be at the station.  When set to zero, the arrival and departure
           times are the same.</li>
           <li>Next speed &mdash; When set to zero, the train's default speed
           will be used.  If not zero, the next speed will be used to
           calculate the time to the next station.  </li>
           <li>Staging track &mdash; The assigned staging track.</li>
           <li>Notes &mdash; Additional information about the stop for train.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>The series of stops define the route for the train.  The assigned
        sequence number and the calculated
        arrival and departure times are displayed.</p>
        <p>After the stops have been added for a train, the order of the stops
        can be changed by selecting a stop and using the <strong>Up</strong> or
        <strong>Down</strong> action buttons.
        <p>The route for a train can include station stops in more than one
        segment.  For example, segment Mainline has stations A, B, C, D and E, and
        segment Branch has stations C, X, Y, Z.  Station C is the junction point.
        A train running from A to Z would be assigned Mainline stops A, B and C.
        The Branch stops would be X, Y and Z.  The rule for segment changes is
        that the first station on the next segment is not a Stop.  Z to A would be
        Branch Z, Y, X and C and Mainline would be B and A.</p>

      <a name="graph" id="graph"></a>
      <h2>Timetable Graph</h2>
      <p>The graph provides a graphical view of the data for a Timetable segment and schedule.</p>
      <p>Select which <a href="#segment">Segment</a> you want to graph from the Segments list.</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 2em">

      <img src="images/TimeTableGraph.png"
      alt="Timetable Editor" height="357" width="809">
      </a>
      </div>

      <p>The window is divided into 4 sections.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The upper left section displays the layout, segment and schedule
      information.</li>
      <li>The station names are listed along the left side.  They are positioned
      relative to the distance from the initial station.</li>
      <li>The top section contains the throttle rows and assignments.  If the
      layout throttle count is zero, this section is blank.</li>
      <li>The body of the graph is in the 4th section.  There is a horizontal
      grid line for each station and a vertical grid line for each hour in the
      timetable.  The trains are represented by colored lines based on the
      assigned train type.  The train name (symbol) is printed at the beginning
      and end points.  The minute values are included based on the main
      timetable menu selection.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>If the schedule duration is 24 hours, a train can wrap around the end
        of the day as long as the wrap occurs during a station stop duration
        period. If it occurs while the train is "running", the train diagram
        gets really goofy.</p>

        <p>For trains that span segments, only the activity in the active segment
        is displayed.</p>

      <h2>CSV Import</h2>
        <p>The CSV Import menu item can be used to create and extend the data for a timetable
        by using additional data from other sources.  The input file has the following format.</p>

              </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Except for Stops, each record can have one of three actions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If no name is supplied, a default object will be created.</li>
          <li>If the name matches an existing name, the existing object will be used.</li>
          <li>A new object will be created with the supplied name.  The remaining
          fields, if any, will replace the default values.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Minimal file using defaults except for station names and distances:</p>
        <pre>
  "Layout"
  "Segment"
  "Station", "Station 1", 0.0
  "Station", "Station 2", 25.0
  "Schedule"
  "Train"
  "Stop", 1
  "Stop", 2
        </pre>
        <p>
        The import applies the changes to the data in memory.  At the end of the
        import a dialog is displayed with the option to save the changes to the
        timetable data file.

      <h2>CSV Export</h2>
        <p>The CSV Export menu item is used to create a CSV file that can imported
        into a spreadsheet program.  The timetable data will be for the selected
        layout, segment and schedule.  The train names will be sorted by name and
        grouped by direction of travel.  The stations will be in order based on
        distance.</p>

        <p>While turns are supported by the graphing process, they don't work for
        a timetable since they have both up and down directions.  For these cases
        use two trains, one for going out and a second one for returning.  In the
        sample below, BT and GT are turns that highlight this issue.
        </p>

        <p>CSV Content:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Line 1 - Layout name, segment name and schedule name.</li>
          <li>Line 2 - Train names sorted by name and grouped by down or up direction.</li>
          <li>Line 3 to end - Station row with the arrival and departure times for each train.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Each record (Java class) has a primary key.  This is assigned by the
      timetable data manager.  Foreign keys create the data structure.</p>

      <a name="technical" id="technical"></a>
      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <p>The Timetable data is stored in a fixed xml file located at
      <strong>preference:timetable/TimeTableData.xml</strong>.  The first time
      the tool is used, the directory is created and a sample data file is
      copied from <strong>program:xml/demoTimeTable/TimeTableData.xml</strong>.</p>

      <p>Access to the data is handled by the TimeTableDataManager.  The
      data manager is obtained by calling <strong>TimeTableDataManager.getDataManager()</strong>.
      This is a static method that returns the current manager or creates a new
      one.  If a new data manager is created, the data is loaded from the
      data file.  The can only be one occurance, and therefore data, at the same
      time.</p>

      <p>The data manager provides data access methods for the TimeTable
      application as well as any other JMRI components, such as Jython.  The data
      manager and the data classes perform extensive integrity checking.  The
      <strong>IllegalArgumentException</strong> will the thrown for any errors.
      The exception includes a keyword describing the problem.  Some exceptions
      have additional supporting data.</p>

      <p>A sample Jython program, <strong>TimeTable.py</strong>, is included in
      the JMRI distribution.  The program shows how to establish the data
      manager connection and navigate the timetable data structure.</p>
