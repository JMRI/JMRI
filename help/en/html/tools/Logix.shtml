      <h1>JMRI: Logix Documentation</h1>

      <p>Logix&trade; provide a powerful capability for JMRI to
      monitor one or more conditions on a layout, and take action
      when these conditions change in a user-specified way. Logix
      can be used to control signals, crossing gates, and other
      types of automation on the layout. The user interface is
      designed to be user friendly to all users with basic
      familiarity with JMRI. A Logix provides a means for setting
      up user-specified logic in an intuitive manner, without the
      user having to be familiar with mathematical
      logic.</p><a name="contents" id="contents"></a>

      <h2>Introduction to Logix and Conditionals</h2>

      <p>A Logix is a small group of Conditionals focused on a
      single task on the layout. Each <a href=
      "#conditional">Conditional</a> may be viewed as a statement
      of the form:</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p><code>if (logical expression) then (action)</code></p></div>

      <p>The "logical expression" part of a Conditional tests the
      state of a group of user-specified conditions on the layout,
      for example, whether certain turnouts are closed or thrown,
      or whether a block is occupied. The "action" part of the
      Conditional specifies what action is to be taken if the state
      of the logical expression changes.</p>

      <p>For example, one Logix with several Conditionals could
      control the appearance of one signal head. The first
      Conditional could check conditions for a GREEN appearance. A
      second Conditional could check on another allowed appearance.
      Other Conditionals could check for other appearances. A Logix
      is flexible enough so that the signal rules of any railroad
      might be set up, provided, of course, information needed to
      test the required conditions is available. So with only one
      Logix, a user should be able to set up the required logic for
      setting the appearance of one signal head.</p>

      <p>Think of a Logix as a <strong>small</strong> group of one or more
      Conditionals that address a single need. Being able to group
      all the Conditionals that address that single need in one
      Logix simplifies things. Only one System Name is needed for
      all the logic addressing the task, and grouping all the logic
      for the task in one place, makes it much easier to see how
      related logical expressions might work together and how they
      might affect each other.</p><a name="logix" id="logix"></a>

      <h2>What are Logix?</h2>

      <p>Except when it is being created or edited, a Logix is
      "active", which means that the entities (turnouts, sensors,
      lights, etc.) in logical expressions of the Logix's
      Conditionals are being monitored. Whenever the state of any
      of the monitored entities of a Conditional changes, that
      Conditional "calculates" its logical expression. If the
      result of the calculation changes the value of the logical
      expression, then the specified actions of the Conditional are
      taken.</p>

      <p>The monitored entities specified in the logical expression
      of a Conditional are called "State Variables" and the result
      of the calculation is the <strong>state</strong> of the Conditional. It
      is the change of state of the Conditional that causes it to
      issue commands for its actions to occur. The logical
      expression is also referred to as the "antecedent" of the
      Conditional and the group of actions to take is also called
      the "consequent" of the Conditional.</p>

      <p>A Logix does not have a state as many JMRI entities do. A
      Logix does have the capability of being "enabled" or
      "disabled", however. When a Logix is disabled (not enabled),
      the logical expressions of its Conditionals are still
      evaluated, but the actions specified in the Conditionals are
      not taken. Whether each Logix is enabled or disabled is saved
      when the Logix is saved to disk, so a Logix that was disabled
      when last stored will start up disabled when next loaded from
      the configuration file. When a Logix that has been disabled
      is enabled, the states of all its Conditionals are set to
      UNKNOWN, and all Conditionals are calculated.</p>

      <h3>The Logix Table</h3>

      <p>A Logix is defined via the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LogixTable.shtml">Logix
      Table</a> that can be accessed by selecting <strong>Logix
      Table</strong> in the Tools menu. The Logix Table lists all
      currently defined Logix by their System Name and User Name.
      The table also shows whether a Logix is "Enabled". The last
      column of the table provides an easy way to edit a Logix and
      its Conditionals. Clicking the <strong>Select</strong> choice box for a
      Logix, will drop down a menu with four choices; <strong>Edit</strong>,
      <strong>Browse</strong>, <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong>.
      Each choice will bring up a pane for the corresponding operation.</p>

      <h4>Logix Table controls</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Below the Logix Table is the <strong>Add...</strong> button.</li>

        <li>The Options menu has three sections:
          <ul>
          <li>
          The first section lets you <strong>Enable</strong> or
          <strong>Disable</strong> all Logixs.
          </li>
          <li>
          The second section lets you select a user name selection
          method.  See the 
          <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LogixTable.shtml#logixOptions">
          Logix Options</a> menu for details.<span class="since">since 4.7.3</span>
          </li>
          <li>
          The third section lets you select a Conditional Editor.  See the 
          <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LogixTable.shtml#logixOptions">
          Logix Options</a> menu for details.<span class="since">since 4.9.2</span>
          </li>
        </ul></li>

        <li>The Tools menu contains five Logix maintenance tools:
          <ul>
            <li>Open picklist tables</li>
            <li>Find orphaned items</li>
            <li>Find empty Conditionals</li>
            <li>Find Cross References</li>
            <li>Conditional Variable References<span class="since">since 4.7.4</span><br>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Creating a new Logix</h3>

      <p>To create a new Logix, click the <strong>Add...</strong> button at
      the bottom of the Logix Table pane. This will bring up a
      Create Logix window. Entering a System Name and a User Name,
      then clicking <strong>Create Logix</strong>, will create the Logix, and
      bring up the Edit Logix window. This window allows
      Conditionals to be created and edited. Once a Logix is
      created, its System Name cannot be changed. Its User Name,
      however, may be changed in either the Logix Table or the Edit
      Logix window. A new User Name may be any useful text,
      provided the new User Name was not previously assigned to
      another Logix.</p>

      <p>A Logix is named using the JMRI convention. The System
      Name for the Logix always must begin with the two letters IX
      and is usually followed by a number selected by the user. For
      example, valid Logix System Names include: IX1, IX34, and
      IX100. The user name is whatever the user wants to use to
      identify the particular Logix, for example, "Signal 5
      Control". As a
      convenience to the user, if the entered System Name does not
      begin with IX, the program will add IX in front of what is
      entered. For example, to enter a System Name of IX32, simply
      enter 32 in the System Name field, and the program will do
      the rest.</p>

      <p>The Edit Logix window displays the System Name and User
      Name of the Logix at the top. The User Name may be changed by
      entering/modifying the text in the User Name field. Next is a
      table of Conditionals belonging to the Logix. To add a new
      Conditional, click the <strong>New Conditional</strong> button under
      the Conditional Table. This will create a new Conditional and
      open the Edit Conditional window allowing the logical
      expression and actions of the new Conditional to be defined.
      An existing Conditional may be edited by clicking the
      <strong>Edit</strong> button of that Conditional in the table. The User
      Name of the Conditional may be changed in the table. The User
      Name of a Conditional may be any useful text, provided it is
      not the same as the User Name of another Conditional in the
      same Logix. The User Name may be the same as the User Name of
      a Conditional in another Logix.  <em>When editing the User Name
      (or any item in any JMRI table) please remember to move to
      another cell in the table so that the program is notified
      that you have finished your entry, otherwise the entry may
      not take effect.</em></p>

      <p>Clicking <strong>Calculate</strong> under the Conditional Table
      causes all Conditionals of the Logix to be calculated.
      Resulting states are displayed in the State column of the
      table. However, since the Logix is being edited it is
      inactive and therefore no Conditional actions are taken. When
      the editing of the Logix is done, the Logix is activated and
      may be enabled to allow Conditionals to execute their
      actions.</p>

      <p>The order of Conditionals in the Conditional Table may be
      changed by clicking <strong>Reorder</strong> (below the Conditional
      Table). Clicking <strong>Reorder</strong> changes all edit buttons in
      the last Column of the table to <strong>First</strong>. Select the
      Conditional that is to be first, and it is immediately moved
      to the top of the table. All remaining buttons change to
      <strong>Next</strong>. Select remaining Conditionals in desired order,
      until all buttons change back to <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>

      <p>The only time when the Conditionals are evaluated in the
      order listed is when all of their states are UNKNOWN, such as
      when the Logix is being enabled. Conditionals are evaluated
      when one of their state variables changes its state. If an
      entity is used as a state variable in more than one
      conditional, it is indeterminate which conditional is
      evaluated first.</p>

      <p>When <strong>Done</strong> is clicked at the bottom of the Edit
      Logix window, any change in the Logix User Name is checked
      and made. A check is made for inconsistencies in specifying
      that an entity (sensor, turnout, etc.) referenced in multiple
      state variables is not monitored as a trigger for calculation
      of the Logix, and a warning message appears if any
      inconsistencies are found. Then the Logix is activated, the
      Edit Logix window is dismissed, and the user is returned to
      the Logix Table. Immediately before the Logix is activated,
      the state of all its Conditionals is set to UNKNOWN.
      Immediately after activation, all Conditionals are
      calculated.</p>

      <p>The Edit Logix window also provides a way to delete a
      Logix if it is no longer needed. Click <strong>Delete Logix</strong> to
      delete the Logix being edited and all its Conditionals. This
      operation can also be done by selecting the <strong>Delete</strong>
      item from the drop down <strong>Select</strong> menu on the Logix
      Table.</p>

      <p>Selecting the <strong>Browse</strong> item from the drop down
      menu on the Logix Table will open a window with a list showing
      the details for each conditional. It is an effective way to
      review the entire contents of a Logix. Click on the close button
      to close the window.<span class="since">since 4.7.3</span>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">

      alt="Conditional Browser Window" height="296" width="562">
      </a>
      </div>
      
      <p>Selecting the <strong>Copy</strong> item from the drop down
      <strong>select</strong> menu on the Logix Table will show a series of
      dialog windows that provide a way to copy the Logix and any
      or all of its Conditional to a new or existing
      Logix.</p><a name="conditional" id="conditional"></a>

      <h2>Conditionals</h2>

      <p>A Conditional's System Name has the form IXnnnnCmm, and is
      set automatically when the Conditional is created by the user
      clicking <strong>New Conditional</strong> in the Edit Logix window. The
      System Name of the first Conditional for Logix IXnnn will
      always be IXnnnC1, the second Conditional will have System
      Name IXnnnC2, and so on. The User Name of a Conditional is
      whatever the user wants to assign to identify the use of the
      Conditional. An entered User Name must not be used by more
      than one Conditional within a given Logix, however. The
      System Name and User Name are displayed at the top of the
      Edit Conditional window. The User Name may be entered/edited
      there or in the Conditional Table of the Edit Logix window.
      The User Name of a Conditional may be any useful text,
      provided it is not the same as the User Name of another
      Conditional in the same Logix. The user name may be the same
      as the User Name of a Conditional in another Logix.</p>

      <p>As mentioned above, Conditionals are statements of the
      form:</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p><code>if (antecedent) then (consequent).
      </code></p></div>

      <p>Therefore a Conditional has two distinct parts: its
      "logical expression" and its "actions". These are discussed
      separately below.</p>

      <p>Logical expressions connect the states (true or false) of
      "state variables". State variables test conditions on the
      layout or in the program, for example, if a sensor is active
      or inactive, if a turnout is closed, if a signal head is red,
      if the fast clock time is between 10:00 and 11:00, etc. State
      variables are linked together in a logical expression by
      logic operators. For a list of currently available state variables, see
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ConditionalAddEdit.shtml#variable">State
      Variables</a></p>

      <p>Logic operators currently available are NOT, AND, AND
      NOT, OR and OR NOT. The AND operator is set up automatically 
      by the program.
      For each state variable, the user selects whether the NOT
      operator is to precede the state variable. If the NOT
      operator precedes the state variable, the true/false value of
      the state variable is reversed. For example, if "Sensor
      Active CS5" is true, "NOT Sensor Active CS5" will be false,
      and vice versa. Note that "Sensor Active CS5" is sometimes
      not the same as "NOT Sensor Inactive CS5", because Sensor CS5
      may be in the UNKNOWN state.</p>

      <p>Logical expressions read like written statements. It is
      easy to set up a logical expression to evaluate many
      situations on the layout. For example, "if block 10 and block
      11 are occupied and turnout 20 is thrown" would be set up
      as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>Sensor "LS1020" is Sensor Active AND Sensor
        "LS1021" is Sensor Active AND Turnout "LT20" is Turnout
        Thrown</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>where LS1020 is a sensor that is true when block 10 is
      occupied (perhaps from a BDL168), sensor LS1021 is true when
      block 11 is occupied, and Turnout Thrown LT20 is true when
      turnout LT20 is thrown. This logical expression would
      calculate to true if all three of the state variables are
      true, i.e., if block 10 is occupied AND block 11 is occupied
      AND turnout 20 is thrown; otherwise it would calculate
      false.</p>

      <p>Actions may be specified for each Conditional. A number of
      action types are available. For example, Set Turnout, Set
      Signal Appearance, Trigger Route, etc. For a list of currently
      available action types, see <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ConditionalAddEdit.shtml#action">Actions</a>. Each
      action has a user selectable option of being performed if: 1)
      the logical expression changes to true, 2) the logical
      expression changes to false, or 3) the logical expression
      changes. This means a conditional may actually be three
      statements.</p>

      <ul><li>if (antecedent is true) then (do "on change to true"
      actions)</li>

      <li>if (antecedent is false) then (do "on change to false"
      actions)</li>

      <li>if (antecedent state changes) then (do "on change"
      actions)</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="editconditional" id="editconditional"></a>
      <h3>The Edit Conditional Window</h3>

      <p>The Edit Conditional window is where logical expressions
      are set up and where actions are specified. The Edit
      Conditional window is displayed when a Conditional is
      created, or when the <strong>Edit</strong> button of a Conditional is
      pressed in the Edit Logix window. The Edit Conditional window
      displays the System Name and User Name of the Conditional at
      the top. The User Name may be edited by entering/modifying
      the text in the User Name field. Any text may be used,
      provided it doesn't duplicate the user name of another
      Conditional in the same Logix. Next are two sections--one for
      the setup of a logical expression and one for set up of the
      actions.</p><a name="logicalexpression" id=
      "logicalexpression"></a>

      <h3>The Logical Expression</h3>

      <p>The logical expression section contains a table of state
      variables, with two buttons and a drop down menu box below.
      The drop down menu allows the choice of what logical
      operators to use in the antecedent. The choices are: all
      <strong>AND</strong>'s, all <strong>OR</strong>'s or
      <strong>Mixed</strong>. Mixed allows the user to specify any combination of
      AND's, OR's and NOT's. When this choice is made the logical expression
      requires parentheses in order to be unambiguous. So, when this choice
      is made, a text field is displayed so that parentheses can be
      inserted and the expression modified. The state variables are
      represented in the expression by their row number.</p>

      <p>The first column in the state variable table is the row
      number of the variable. The next column displays the logic
      operation preceding the variable in the expression. In the
      case of "Mixed" a choice box allows the user to choose an
      operation. However these choices can be changed in the
      antecedent text field and it is the text field expression
      that the Conditional uses to determine its state. The third
      column contains a choice box that allows the user to select
      the NOT operator as needed.</p>

      <p>The fourth column is a description of state variable and
      the condition to be monitored to be for its state to be true.
      The next column shows the state that was last tested for the
      variable (true or false). The state displayed includes the
      effect of the NOT operator, if NOT is selected.</p>

      <p>The "Trigger" column sets whether the state variable
      should cause the Conditional to perform its actions when this
      variable changes. Note that the current states of all the
      variables are <strong>always</strong> used in the calculation of the
      Conditional's state. The "Trigger" setting allows a state
      variable to be "passive" and not cause the conditional to
      evaluate its state. That is, such a variable state is a
      necessary condition, but not a sufficient one to cause any
      actions to take place.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Disabling state variable triggers should be
      done with caution. Actions are performed only when the state
      of the logical expression changes. Disabling a trigger can
      prevent actions from be executed even when this state has
      changed.</p>

      <p>Next is a column of <strong>Edit</strong> button to modify an
      existing state variable. The last column of the table
      (<strong>Delete</strong> buttons) is used to delete a state variable if
      you decide it is no longer needed.</p>

      <a name="variable" id="variable"></a>
      <p>Press the <strong>Add State Variable</strong> to add a state
      variable (a row in the State Variable table). This brings up
      a window with a choice box for the user to select a state
      variable type. Available state variables are documented at
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ConditionalAddEdit.shtml#variable">State
      Variables</a>. When a type is chosen the Edit
      Variable window displays a text field for the name of the
      entity to be used for the state variable. When a name (either
      System Name or user name) is entered, it must correspond to
      an existing entity (sensor, turnout, light, etc.). Depending on
      your <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LogixTable.shtml#selectMethod">selection
      method</a>, a tabbed Pick List,
      a single Pick List or a dropdown combo box will be displayed to
      aid in name selection.</p>

      <p>At any time during the entry of state variable data, the
      <strong>Check State Variables</strong> button may be clicked to check
      the entered data and evaluate the state variables. When this
      button is pressed, the checking and evaluation proceeds until
      the check completes successfully, or an error is detected. If
      an error is detected, the checking stops for the user to
      correct the error and click <strong>Check State Variables</strong>
      again. <em>Please remember after editing the System Name and
      data items to click a different cell in the table before
      clicking <strong>Check State Variables</strong> (or <strong>Update
      Conditional</strong> at the bottom of the window) so that the
      program is notified that you have finished your entry.
      Otherwise your entry may not take effect, and an error may be
      reported unnecessarily.</em></p><a name="thepolicy" id=

      <h3>Triggering the Actions</h3>

      <p>There are two policies that can be taken after a
      conditional's state is evaluated:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Execute the conditional actions only if the state of
        the conditional has changed</li>

        <li>Execute the conditional actions regardless whether the
        state has changed</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Which policy to use is chosen by the radio buttons in the
      middle of the Edit Conditional window. The <strong>Execute actions
      on change of state only</strong> button prevents unwanted behavior
      from occurring when multiple instances of the "on true" or
      "on false" actions are executed. That is, if successive
      triggers cause the logical expression to be evaluated to the
      same state, only the first trigger will execute the actions.
      Normally, it is best for a conditional to execute its actions
      only when the state of the conditional changes. However, if
      it is important to maintain the actions associated with a
      particular state of the Conditional the <strong>Execute actions
      whenever triggered</strong> button should be used. If external
      events undo some of the actions of the conditional but do not
      change the state of the conditional, then this policy will
      execute the action on any trigger.</p><a name="theactions"
      id="theactions"></a>

      <h3>The Actions</h3>

      <p>The Actions section of the Edit Conditional window
      contains a table of actions, with two buttons below for
      adding a new action and reordering the list of actions. The
      section provides for specifying the actions to be taken when
      a Conditional is calculated and changes its state. The action
      table consists of a column for the description of the action
      to be taken and two columns of buttons, <strong>Edit</strong> and
      <strong>Delete</strong>, for editing or deleting an existing action. To
      add a new action, press the "Add Action" button. A new "Edit
      Action" window will appear. Select an action type in the type
      box, and data items needed to completely specify the action
      will appear to the right of the type box. When a name must be
      entered, the name must correspond to the System Name or the
      User Name of an existing entity (sensor, turnout, signal
      head, etc.) of the proper type. Depending on your
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LogixTable.shtml#selectMethod">selection method</a>, a tabbed Pick List, a single Pick List or a dropdown
      combo box will be displayed to aid in name selection. Available
      action types are described in detail at
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ConditionalAddEdit.shtml#action">Actions</a>.
      <em>If you use User Names to specify your actions, the same caution noted above
      applies. Be very careful when editing User Names that are used to
      specify actions.</em></p>

      <p>For each action, three options are available for when to
      perform the action: 1) On Change to True, 2) On Change to
      False, and 3) On Change. These refer to the calculated state
      of the Conditional, which is equal to the value of the
      logical expression as specified in the state variable table.
      One of these options must be selected. When done, click
      either "Update" to install your changes, "Cancel" to close
      the window without any changes or "Delete" to remove the
      action entirely.</p>

      <p>To change the order order of the Conditionals in a Logix,
      or the order of the actions in a conditional click the
      "Reorder" button. The right-most buttons in the table will
      then let you select the first one, next one, etc. Note
      however, this is merely the order in which the commands are
      issued but do not guarantee that their final effect will
      occur in the same order. If it is necessary to have actions
      take place in a specified order, use separate Conditionals
      for each action and chain the Conditionals such that a
      preceding action's completed state is the state variable for
      the succeeding action.</p><a name="updateconditional" id=
      "updateconditional"></a>

      <h3>Activating the Conditional</h3>

      <p>When the logical expression and actions have been
      specified, click <strong>Update Conditional</strong> at the bottom of
      the window. This initiates a check of the logical expression
      (the same as done by <strong>Check State Variables</strong>) and a
      check of entered data for actions. If the Conditional's User
      Name has been edited, it is also checked. If an error is
      found, a message box opens announcing the error, and the
      update is stopped to allow the user to correct the error and
      click <strong>Update Conditional</strong> again. If no error is found,
      the Conditional is updated with the entered data, the Edit
      Conditional window is closed, and the user is returned to the
      Edit Logix window.</p>

      <p>Two other buttons are available at the bottom of the Edit
      Conditional window. Clicking <strong>Cancel</strong> will close the
      Edit Conditional window without updating the Conditional.
      Clicking <strong>Cancel</strong> results in loss of any data that has
      been entered. The other button, <strong>Delete Conditional</strong>,
      provides an easy way to delete an unneeded Conditional. Click
      <strong>Delete Conditional</strong> to delete the Conditional being
      edited and return to the Edit Logix window.</p><a name=
      "start" id="start"></a>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <p>The following steps let you create your first Logix and
      become familiar with how the Logix user interface works.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select Table -&gt; <strong><a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LogixTable.shtml">Logix</a></strong>
        in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>

        <li>Click the <strong><a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LogixAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a></strong>
        button below the Logix Table.</li>

        <li>In the Create Logix window that appears, enter 6 for
        System Name, and "test" for User Name, then click <strong>Create
        Logix</strong>.</li>

        <li>In the Edit Logix window that appears, click <strong>New
        Conditional</strong>.</li>

        <li>In the Edit Conditional window that appears, click
        <strong>Add State Variable</strong> to begin defining a logical
        expression for the Conditional.</li>

        <li>In the new window that appears, click the "Variable
        Type" choice box to reveal a scrolling selection box.
        Select "Sensor".</li>

        <li>Note that a text field appears asking for entry of a
        sensor name. Enter the name (either System Name or User
        Name) of any of your existing sensors. (If you don't have
        an existing sensor, select <strong>Sensor Table</strong> in the
        <strong>Tools</strong> menu and create one.)  Select <strong>Inactive</strong>
        from the Variable State drop down.</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Update</strong> button and note the row entries
        that appear in the state variable table.</li>

        <li>Click <strong>New State Variable</strong> to create another row
        in the table. Note that AND appears in the first column of
        the new row. Again select "Sensor" as the variable
        type, and enter the name and desired state of a different
        sensor (create it if needed).</li>

        <li>Click the third column entry of the second row to
        reveal the selection box for NOT. Select NOT, then click
        <strong>Check State Variables</strong> again. Note that the State of
        the second state variable has reversed.</li>

        <li>For an Action click <strong>Add Action</strong>.</li>

        <li>In the new window that appears, click the "Action Type"
        choice box to reveal a scrolling selection box. Select
         "Turnout", and enter the name (System Name or User Name) of
        one of your turnouts. (If you don't have any turnouts,
        create one using the <strong>Add</strong> button in the Turnout
        Table.) Select <strong>Set Turnout</strong> for the Action Type,
        leave the "Turnout Position" option at "Closed" and
        "Change Option" at "On Change to True".</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Update</strong> button and note the row entries
        that appear in the action table.</li>

        <li>For another Action - again click <strong>Add Action</strong> and
        select "Turnout". Enter the name of the same turnout
        entered before. Select "On Change to False" as the Trigger
        Option, and "Thrown" as the Turnout Position.</li>

        <li>Click <strong>Update</strong> to close the Edit Conditional
        window and return to the Edit Logix window.</li>

        <li>Click <strong>Done</strong> to close the Edit Logix window and
        activate your new Logix. Click <strong>OK</strong> in the
        reminder-to-save dialog that appears.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You'll have created a Logix to control the setting of a
      turnout according to the states of two sensors. It's as
      simple as that. It took you more time to read this tutorial
      than to create the Logix.</p>

      <h3>Saving Logix to disk</h3>

        <p>Logix are kept in your <i>layout configuration</i>, along
        with Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads, control panel setup etc.
        To store this information on disk, allowing to
        <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload
            it</a> next time you run JMRI, use <b>Store Configuration...</b>
        in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Logix Table (or other
        tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b>
        in the <b>Panel</b> menu. Note that the enabled/disabled
        state of each Logix is saved in the configuration file.</p>

      <a name="notes" id="notes"></a>
      <h2>Additional Notes</h2>

      <p>This section contains questions and answers that normally
      are not needed by Logix users, but in some cases were
      important or of interest for previous versions of Logix.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Why have a "group" of Conditionals instead of just
          single Conditionals?</strong></p>

          <p>A group of Conditionals was chosen for several
          reasons, including:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Grouping Conditionals into a Logix, and focusing
            the Logix on one task should end up being much more
            user friendly. Think about one Logix with several
            Conditionals controlling one three-turnout signal head.
            The first Conditional could check conditions for a RED
            appearance, and take appropriate action. The second
            Conditional could check on another allowed appearance
            which, depending upon the rules of the railroad being
            modeled could depend upon the calculated state of the
            first Conditional. Other Conditionals would check for
            other appearances according to the rules of the
            railroad. So with only one Logix, a user should be able
            to set up the required logic for setting appearances
            for one signal head. Thus once the sensors, turnouts,
            and signal heads are set up, only one new System Name,
            the System Name of the Logix, need be defined and kept
            track of.</li>

            <li>Another reason for grouping multiple Conditionals
            is simpler operation. Fewer behind the scene listeners
            are needed to accomplish the same task. Even though,
            following the example above, the logic for each
            appearance of the signal head (each Conditional) may
            depend upon a particular sensor (a block occupancy for
            example), if the Conditionals are combined into a
            single Logix, only _one_ listener for that sensor is
            required. This is simpler in implementation than having
            multiple listeners.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>How is a Logix started?</strong></p>

          <p>Start of a Logix is similar to the way a light, a
          route, or other continuously running JMRI entity starts.
          Internally a Logix has an "activate" method, that is
          called when the Logix is created, after it is edited, or
          when it is loaded from a configuration file. This method
          starts listeners for items in the state variables of the
          Logix's Conditionals. When any of these listeners fires
          (indicating that the watched property of a state variable
          has changed), the Logix is calculated, resulting in
          appropriate actions being taken, provided the Logix is
          enabled.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>What is the initial state of a Logix and its
          Conditionals?</strong></p>

          <p>When a Logix is created or edited, the initial state
          of each Conditional is true or false as shown in the Edit
          Logix window. When a Logix is loaded from a configuration
          file, the initial state of each Conditional is
          UNKNOWN.</p>

          <p>A Logix is enabled automatically when it is created. A
          Logix may be disabled/enabled by unchecking/checking the
          button in the Enable column in the Logix table. For
          example, you might want to disable a Logix while you're
          creating and debugging it, until you're certain that you
          have it set up properly. A Logix may be enabled or
          disabled dynamically by another Logix (see allowed
          <a href=
          "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ConditionalAddEdit.shtml#action">Actions</a>.
          ).</p>

          <p>When JMRI stores the layout configuration in a file,
          e.g. a panel file, all Logix information, including the
          enabled/disabled state of the Logix, is stored. When a
          Logix is loaded from a configuration file, its enabled
          or disabled status is set according to what was saved in
          the configuration file. This is done so that people can
          disable their Logix while debugging them, yet still save
          and restore the configuration as needed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>What happens when a JMRI program starts up or when a
          configuration file is loaded by a JMRI program?</strong>

          <p>This is a complex question that depends upon many
          things, such as, how the user has set up for turnout
          feedback, block detection, etc. When a configuration file
          is read, the various entities (sensors, turnouts, signal
          heads, etc.) are loaded in an almost random order. So
          it's not reasonable, for example, to calculate each Logix
          as it is loaded, since the needed state variable entities
          might not be present when the Logix is loaded. And, since
          most entities will load in UNKNOWN state, calculating a
          Logix immediately after the entire configuration file is
          loaded doesn't produce a clean start up either. So when a
          Logix is loaded, the state of each Conditional starts as
          UNKNOWN. Immediately after the entire configuration file
          is loaded, all Logix are activated, and then all the
          Logix are calculated. The state of Conditionals changes
          from UNKNOWN to true or false. But will the calculated
          state of the Conditional be "correct" if one or more of
          the state variables is evaluated from an entity in an
          UNKNOWN state? For example, think of a turnout in an
          UNKNOWN state--Turnout Thrown and Turnout Closed will
          both evaluate to false. As listeners continue to fire for
          state variables, eventually every entity has its correct
          current state and the Logix will work fine. You can
          monitor this action by watching states in the Sensor
          Table, the Turnout Table, etc. Conditions at start up
          certainly are something to keep in mind when setting up a
          Logix.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>When should Triggers Calculation be unchecked in a
          state variable?</strong>

          <p>Normally Triggers Calculation should be checked in all
          state variables, so a change in any of its state variable
          will trigger calculation of a Logix. This results in the
          Logix quickly reacting to changes on the layout, and
          maintaining the status of signals, turnouts, etc. as
          desired. There are situations, however, where it is
          desirable to test the state of an entity, but not use it
          as a calculation trigger. The following paragraphs
          describe a couple of those situations, but there are
          others.</p>

          <p>Occasionally a "logic loop" can result if triggering
          is not suppressed. For example, if the state of a turnout
          is tested in a state variable, and the same turnout is
          set in an action of the same or another Conditional of
          the same Logix, continuous triggering (a logic loop)
          could result. The easiest way out of this dilemma is to
          test the turnout, without using it as a triggering
          entity. This is done by unchecking Triggers Calculation
          in <strong>all</strong> state variables where the turnout is
          specified. If the turnout is used in state variables of
          more than one Conditional of the Logix, it must be
          unchecked everywhere it is used to suppress using it as a
          trigger.</p>

          <p>Another situation arises when Delayed Set Sensor
          action is used with an internal sensor to trigger a
          second Logix after the delay time has elapsed. If the
          second Logix is not to be triggered before the delay time
          elapses, all of its state variables, except for the
          delayed internal sensor, should be unchecked. This
          scenario might occur, for example, if a Conditional turns
          on something as its first action, and sets a Delayed Set
          Sensor as its second action to turn off that something
          after a specified time provided certain conditions are
          met.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>What is a "logic loop" and how can it be avoided?</strong>

          <p>A "logic loop" results when the program appears to
          slow down significantly or lock up as multiple Logixs are
          continuously triggered by changing references to each
          other. The best way to avoid a "logic loop" is to be
          aware of situations that can lead to a loop, and plan
          your logic to avoid such situations.</p>

          <p>A "logic loop" can result within a single Logix when a
          state variable (sensor, turnout, etc.) that triggers the
          Logix is also changed by that same Logix. The Logix
          editor will detect some situations that could result in a
          loop, and will issue a warning when you close the Logix.
          <strong>Heed these warnings!</strong> A warning doesn't mean that a
          loop definitely will result if you continue. The warning
          message is a "wake up call" that you should study
          carefully what you're doing to make sure a loop won't
          result.</p>

          <p>A more complicated situation involving two or more
          Logixs can also result in a "logic loop". For example, if
          Logix 1 is triggered by sensor A, and has an action that
          changes turnout B, and Logix 2 is triggered by turnout B
          and changes sensor A, the potential for a loop exists as
          these Logixs trigger each other. You can easily extend
          this idea to triggering chains (loops) involving three or
          more Logixs, and even to interactions between Logixs and
          Routes. There is no test in the program to warn about
          loops involving multiple Logixs. (To develop such a test
          would be very difficult.)</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>What should I do if I think I have a "logic loop"?</strong>

          <p>When they do occur, "logic loops" can be a bit scary
          to trouble shoot. Your computer may appear to be locked
          up, or slowed to a crawl as the loop uses up most of the
          available computer time. Fortunately JMRI provides tools
          to help in design and debugging. Unchecking "Triggers
          Calculation" for a state variable (discussed above), can
          help you design around loops when you have identified the
          Logix causing the looping problem. To get around the lock
          up or slow down problem, start with all your Logixs
          disabled, (see below) then enable them one by one until
          you discover the loop.</p>

          <p>If the panel file containing Logixs loads
          automatically when the program starts up, press and
          release the shift key a few times rapidly as soon as you
          see the small JMRI splash screen (the first thing you see
          during start up). Your panel file will be loaded with all
          Logixs disabled.</p>

          <p>If you load your panel file manually using the Panels
          &gt; Open Panel...
          menu, before loading your file, go to the <strong>Debug</strong>
          menu and select <strong>Load Logixs Disabled</strong>. After
          responding OK to the message, load your panel file as you
          normally would. Your panel file will be loaded with all
          Logixs disabled.</p>

          <p>After loading your panel file, open the Logix Table
          and verify that all Logixs are disabled. If you know
          which Logix is causing the trouble, you can then fix it
          or delete it, re-enable the other Logixs, and save your
          panel file. If you don't know which Logix is causing the
          problem, you can enable your Logixs, one by one, until
          the loop occurs. When the loop starts, you know that the
          last Logix you enabled is at least partly responsible for
          the problem. At this point you should restart the program
          with all Logixs disabled, and fix or delete the Logix you
          identified.</p>

          <p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> <strong>It's wise to save your panel file
          frequently when entering Logixs.</strong> If a logic loop
          occurs, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to save
          your panel file before shutting down the program.
          Remember that a Logix is activated as soon as you click
          <strong>Done</strong> in the Edit Logix window. Also, remember that
          hitting an <strong>Edit</strong> button in the Logix Table
          deactivates the selected Logix before opening it for
          editing, offering a possible way to break into a logic
          loop without restarting the program.</p>
