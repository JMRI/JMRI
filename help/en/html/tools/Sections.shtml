      <h1>JMRI: Sections Documentation</h1>

      <h2>What is a Section?</h2>

      <p>A <b>Section</b> is a group of one or more connected
      <b>Blocks</b> that may be allocated to a train traveling in a
      given direction. Sections were created to solve the direction
      problem that can occur when using Blocks directly. A Section
      has only two directions, "forward" or "reverse". Sections can
      be traversed by a Train in either direction. Section
      direction is independent of the direction set for the
      locomotive by a throttle. In addition to solving the
      direction problem, Sections offer the user other useful
      features.</p>

      <p>Sections can be considered an extension of Blocks. Many
      Sections contain only one Block. All Blocks contained in a
      multi-Block Section must be different. Blocks are kept in
      order--the first block is connected to the second, the second
      is connected to the third, etc. That means a Block in a
      Section must be connected to the Block before it (if there is
      one) and to the Block after it (if there is one), but may not
      be connected to any other Block in the Section. A Section may
      not contain any reverse loops.</p>

      <p>Sections and their associated <b><a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transits</a></b>
      are designed to provide support for dispatching, either
      manual dispatching (by a dispatcher sitting at a panel), or
      automatic dispatching by the computer. Dispatching is the
      temporary allocation of Sections for the exclusive use of
      trains, either run by engineers with a throttle, and/or run
      automatically by the computer. Support for dispatching is
      provided by <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"><b>Dispatcher</b></a>,
      which also provides for set up and running of trains
      automatically.</p>

      <p>A Section's <b>direction</b> is defined by the sequence in
      which Blocks are added to a multi-Block Section. For a single
      Block Section the direction is chosen arbitrarily when the
      Section is created. A train may run through a Section in
      either the <b>forward</b> direction (from first block to last
      block) or <b>reverse</b> direction (from last block to first
      block). If a Section has only one Block, the <b>direction</b>
      of that Section is chosen when setting up its <b>Entry
      Points</b> (see below).</p>

      <p>Therefore, when setting up multi-block sections, you
      should choose blocks in the same order across the layout for
      sequentially connected sections. That way, the forward and
      reverse directions will have consistent meaning for sections
      on a relative basis</p>

      <p>A Section has one or more <b>Entry Points</b>. An Entry
      Point defines a connection from a Block inside the Section to
      a Block outside of the Section. Entry Points are set up using
      Paths of Blocks in the Section--Paths that represent
      connections to Blocks not contained in the Section. Entry
      Points are classified in one of two ways:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Whether entering the Section at that Entry Point will
        result in a train traveling in the "forward"
        direction.</li>

        <li>whether entering at that Entry Point will result in a
        train traveling in the "reverse" direction.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Sections are designed to be allocated to one train at a
      time. If a portion of connected track is long enough to
      support multiple trains simultaneously traveling in the same
      direction, one following the other, that connected track
      should be divided into two or more Sections, if the user
      wants to run following trains in that area.</p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>

      <p>Sections may be used with a Panel Editor Panel, with a
      Layout Editor Panel, with a CTC machine, or directly without
      any Panel. Sections build on JMRI's Blocks and Paths
      structure. So before attempting to create any Sections, you
      should have Blocks and Paths fully initialized for your
      layout. (An easy way to automatically initialize your Blocks
      and Paths is to sketch out a Layout Editor panel of your
      layout, with Blocks assigned. By assigning Blocks to all
      track segments, Turnouts, etc., the paths will be created
      automatically for you by JMRI.)</p>

      <p>Layout blocking should be carefully planned, to provide
      "<i>reasonable</i>" Sections--Sections that make sense for a
      Dispatcher to allocate to a certain Train. For right-handed
      or left-handed Turnouts switching mainline track, for
      example, this usually means including the Turnout in the same
      Block as the track entering at the Turnout throat, and
      providing separate Blocks for continuing and diverging
      tracks. Some users prefer to have a Turnout in a separate
      Block, and that works fine also. From a Dispatching
      perspective, tracks of mainline Turnouts that branch to
      industries do not need to be separately blocked, but blocking
      here is acceptable. A layout blocking scheme that works well
      for Signals, should work fine for Sections also.</p>

      <p>Signals are not required for using Sections, but Sections
      will work fine with Signals installed. If Signals are
      installed, the direction Sensors included in Sections provide
      an easy way to set up simple APB signaling (see <a href=
      "#SignalMast">below</a>).</p>

      <h3>Support for Optional Direction and Stopping Sensors</h3>

      <p>Optionally each Section may have two <i>direction
      sensors</i>, one for the forward direction and one for the
      reverse direction. These are normally internal Sensors,
      bearing system names that begin with IS. They automatically
      follow the state of their Section. A Section has three
      states, <b>FREE</b> (not allocated to a train),
      <b>FORWARD</b> (allocated for travel in the forward
      direction), and <b>REVERSE</b> (allocated for travel in the
      reverse direction. When the state of the Section is
      <b>FREE</b> both direction sensors are set <b>ACTIVE</b>.
      When the state of the Section is <b>FORWARD</b>, the forward
      direction sensor is <b>INACTIVE</b> and the reverse direction
      sensor is <b>ACTIVE</b>. Similarly, when the state of the
      Section is <b>REVERSE</b>, the forward direction sensor is
      <b>ACTIVE</b> and the reverse direction sensor is
      <b>INACTIVE</b>. These sensors may be used in signal logic to
      force signals for travel in the direction opposite to the
      allocated direction to <b>RED</b>. Tools are provided here in
      the Section Table to automatically add direction sensors to
      signal logic or to automatically remove all direction sensors
      from Signal Mast Logic (see the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/TransitTable.shtml#tools">
      Transit Table Tools</a>). Alternatively, if <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"><b>Dispatcher</b></a>
      is being used, it can add direction sensors to signal logic
      as needed.</p>

      <p>Also optionally each Section may have two <i>Stopping
      Sensors</i> that indicate when a Train in the Section has
      reached the end of the Section by traveling in the forward
      direction or in the reverse direction. Stopping Sensors
      should be physical sensors on the layout, for example
      infrared point detectors. For manual dispatching, these
      Sensors may be displayed on a Panel to indicate to the
      Dispatcher when a Train has reached the end of its
      allocation. For automatic running, these Sensors may be used
      to stop a Train before it reaches the end of its allocated
      Section, and before it overruns a Red signal, if Signals are
      present.</p>

      <h3><a name='SignalMast' id="SignalMast">Using Signal Mast
      Logic with Sections</a></h3>

      <p>If your signaling is based using <a href=
      "signaling/SignalMasts.shtml">Signal Masts</a>, with the
      associated logic that has been generated using the Layout
      Editor, then it is possible to also have Sections
      automatically generated based upon the logic.</p>

      <p>The tool can be found in the <b>SignalMast Logic Table</b>
      | <b>Tools</b> | <b>Generate Sections</b> Running this will
      immediately create Sections that each contain all of the
      Blocks between any already-defined Signal Mast Pairs. It will
      also setup each "Automatically Generated" Section so that
      they include those Blocks in the correct order, with the
      direction being set as FORWARD travel, going from the source
      to destination Signal Mast. Please note that the Block
      details are not saved when the Panel is stored, but are
      re-created when the file is reloaded from disk.</p>

      <p>The tool will also automatically create forward and
      reverse direction Sensors and places them in the Section,
      however currently the Signal Mast Logic does not use these
      and their creation is only there to allow validation of the
      Section (or use by the user in unrelated Logix if
      desired).</p>

      <p>Sections generated with the tool will only have a pair of
      Entry Points and simply follows the path between the two
      Signals.</p>

      <p>Direction Sensors (Forward and Reverse) are created by the
      Generate Sections tool, but Stopping Sensors (Forward and
      Reverse) need to be added manually by the user via the Edit
      Sections window for each section if desired.</p>

      <p>The details of the Optional Direction and Stopping Sensors
      are saved when the Panel file is stored.</p>

      <p>To use the Sections that have been built this way you will
      next need to setup <a href=
      "Transits.shtml">Transits</a>.
      Following that, you will also need to set the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"><b>Dispatcher</b></a>
      to use SignalMast Logic via the Dispatcher's <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Options.shtml"><b>Options</b></a>
      menu.</p>

      <h2>How to setup Sections</h2>

      <h3>Displaying and creating Sections</h3>

      <p>All the Sections that JMRI knows about can be viewed using
      the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SectionTable.shtml">Section
      Table</a>. Select <b>Sections</b> in the <b>Tables</b>
      submenu of the <b>Tools</b> menu of the main JMRI program
      window. Sections can either be created manually from the
      Section Table pane, or they can be created automatically if
      you also plan to use <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SectionTable.shtml#SignalMast">
      Signal Mast Logic</a>. There are eight columns in the Section
      Table:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>System Name</b> - The system name is assigned to the
        Section when it's created, and can't be changed.</li>

        <li><b>User Name</b> - If you're interested in having your
        Sections carry "human readable" names, you can click in the
        "User Name" column and change that information to whatever
        you want.</li>

        <li><b>State</b> - The state of a Section tells whether a
        section is "allocated" or "in use" by one or more trains.
        The state of a newly added section is always <b>FREE</b>.
        When a Section is allocated for travel in the direction
        from the "First Block" toward the "Last Block", the state
        is <b>FORWARD</b>. When allocated for travel in the
        opposite direction, the state is <b>REVERSE</b>.</li>

        <li><b>Comment</b> - This column is for your use to record
        any comment you may want to use to keep track of your
        Sections. It is for information only.</li>

        <li>Click the <b>Delete</b> button in a specific row to
        delete the Section in that row. Remember to remove any
        Transits using this Section. Any Transit that uses a
        deleted Section will be broken! Use this button with
        caution!</li>

        <li><b>First Block</b> - This column displays the first
        block in the Section. Since a section is a group of one or
        more connected blocks, there is always an entry.</li>

        <li><b>Last Block</b> - This column shows the final block
        in the Section. Since a section may contain only one block,
        the Last Block may be the same as the First Block.</li>

        <li>Click the <b>Edit</b> button in a row to view or change
        entered information for a Section. The System Name cannot
        be changed but the User Name may be changed, Blocks may be
        redefined, entry points may be reconfigured, etc. Only one
        Section may be edited at a time. A Section may not be
        edited if another one is being created.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Section Table Controls</h3>

      <p>Below the Section Table there's an <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SectionAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
      button.</p>

      <p>The <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SectionTable.shtml#tools">
      <b>Tools</b></a> menu gives access to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Validate All Sections...</li>

        <li>Set Direction Sensors in Logic...</li>

        <li>Remove Direction Sensors from Logic...</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Creating a new Section</h3>

      <p>To Create a new Section, click the "<a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SectionAddEdit.shtml">Add..."
      button</a>. A window will be brought up that will allow you
      to define the blocks included in the new Section, and if
      necessary, designate which entry points to the section result
      in travel in the FORWARD and REVERSE directions.</p>

      <p>Currently the user must manually select <b>FORWARD</b> or
      <b>REVERSE</b> for each Entry Point after all Blocks are
      added to a Section. The program will set some directions
      automatically, but others are left as <b>UNKNOWN</b>. An
      Entry Point should be set to FORWARD if a train entering the
      Section at that Entry Point would be traveling in the FORWARD
      direction. Otherwise it should be set to REVERSE. A possible
      future addition is to set directions of Entry Points
      automatically from the connectivity found in a Layout Editor
      panel.</p>

      <p>For Sections with more than one Block, travel from a
      lower-numbered block to a higher-numbered block is FORWARD
      travel. Stated a different way, moving from a block higher in
      the block list to a block lower in the list is FORWARD
      travel. Similarly moving from a higher-numbered block to a
      lower-numbered block is REVERSE travel. For Sections with
      only one block, it doesn't make any difference which
      direction through the Section is designated FORWARD, as long
      as Entry Point travel directions are consistent. That is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>REVERSE and FORWARD directions of travel must be
        opposite.</li>

        <li>Entering at any FORWARD Entry Point must result in
        travel in the same direction as entering at all other
        FORWARD Entry Points.</li>

        <li>Entering at any REVERSE Entry Point must result in
        travel in the same direction as entering at all other
        REVERSE Entry Points.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>WARNING: If Entry Points are not consistent strange
      behavior may result when using the Section.</b></p>

      <h3>Saving Sections to disk</h3>

      <p>Use the <b>Store</b> item in the <b>File</b> menu of the
      Section Table (or the <b>Store Panels...</b> item in the
      <b>Panels</b> menu of the main JMRI window) to save Section
      information to disk, allowing to
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload
      it</a> next time you run JMRI.
      This information (and any modified
      signal logic information) is saved with the configuration and
      panels in an XML file, along with control panel setup and
      similar stuff. To store your panels in the same file
      (recommended), select <b>File&gt;Store&gt;Store Configuration
      and Panels To File...</b> or select <b>Panels&gt;Store
      Panels...</b> in the main JMRI window.</p>
