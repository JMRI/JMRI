      <h2>What is a Section?</h2>

      <p>A <strong>Section</strong> is a group of one or more connected <strong>Blocks</strong>
      that may be allocated to a train traveling in a given direction. Sections were created to
      solve the direction problem that can occur when using Blocks directly. A Section has only two
      directions, "forward" or "reverse". Sections can be traversed by a Train in either direction.
      Section direction is independent of the direction set for the locomotive by a throttle. In
      addition to solving the direction problem, Sections offer the user other useful features.</p>

      <img src="images/DispatcherSection.png" width="842" height="137" alt="sample sections">
      <p>Sections can be considered an extension of Blocks. Many Sections contain only one Block.
      All Blocks contained in a multi-Block Section must be different. Blocks are kept in
      order--the first block is connected to the second, the second is connected to the third, etc.
      That means a Block in a Section must be connected to the Block before it (if there is one)
      and to the Block after it (if there is one), but may not be connected to any other Block in
      the Section. A Section may not contain any reverse loops.</p>

      <p>Sections and their associated <strong><a href="Transits.shtml">Transits</a></strong> are
      designed to provide support for dispatching, either manual dispatching (by a dispatcher
      sitting at a panel), or automatic dispatching by the computer. Dispatching is the temporary
      allocation of Sections for the exclusive use of a train, either run by an engineer with a
      throttle, and/or run automatically by the computer. Support for dispatching is provided by
      <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"><strong>Dispatcher</strong></a>, which
      also provides for set up and running of trains automatically.</p>

      <p>A Section's <strong>direction</strong> is defined by the sequence in which Blocks are
      added to a multi-Block Section. For a single Block Section the direction is chosen
      arbitrarily when the Section is created. A train may run through a Section in either the
      <strong>forward</strong> direction (from first block to last block) or
      <strong>reverse</strong> direction (from last block to first block). If a Section has only
      one Block, the <strong>direction</strong> of that Section is chosen when setting up its
      <strong>Entry Points</strong> (see below).</p>

      <p>Therefore, when setting up multi-block sections, you should choose blocks in the same
      order across the layout for sequentially connected sections. That way, the forward and
      reverse directions will have consistent meaning for sections on a relative basis. For
      example, a loop style layout might declare clockwise to be forward. A point-to-point layout
      might define left to right as forward.</p>

      <p>A Section has one or more <strong>Entry Points</strong>. An Entry Point defines a
      connection from a Block inside the Section to a Block outside of the Section. Entry Points
      are set up using Paths of Blocks in the Section--Paths that represent connections to Blocks
      not contained in the Section. Entry Points are classified in one of two ways:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Whether entering the Section at that Entry Point will result in a train traveling in
        the "forward" direction.</li>

        <li>Whether entering at that Entry Point will result in a train traveling in the "reverse"
        direction.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Sections are designed to be allocated to one train at a time. If a portion of connected
      track is long enough to support multiple trains simultaneously traveling in the same
      direction, one following the other, that connected track should be divided into two or more
      Sections, if the user wants to run following trains in that area.</p>

      <h2>Direction and Stopping Sensors</h2>

      <p>Optionally, each Section may have two <em>direction sensors</em>, one for the Forward
      direction and one for the Reverse direction. These are normally internal Sensors, bearing
      system names that begin with IS. They automatically follow the state of their Section. A
      Section has three states: <strong>FREE</strong> (not allocated to a train),
      <strong>FORWARD</strong> (allocated for travel in the forward direction), and
      <strong>REVERSE</strong> (allocated for travel in the reverse direction. When the state of
      the Section is <strong>FREE</strong>, both direction sensors are set <strong>ACTIVE</strong>.
      When the state of the Section is <strong>FORWARD</strong>, the forward direction sensor is
      <strong>INACTIVE</strong> and the reverse direction sensor is <strong>ACTIVE</strong>.
      Similarly, when the state of the Section is <strong>REVERSE</strong>, the forward direction
      sensor is <strong>ACTIVE</strong> and the reverse direction sensor is
      <strong>INACTIVE</strong>. These sensors may be used in signal logic to force signals for
      travel in the direction opposite to the allocated direction to <strong>RED</strong> (Stop).
      Tools are provided in the Section Table menu to automatically add direction sensors to signal
      logic or to automatically remove all direction sensors from signal logic. Alternatively, if
      <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"><strong>Dispatcher</strong></a> is
      being used, it can add direction sensors to signal logic as needed.</p>

      <p>The direction sensors can also be used with Signal Mast Logic. The direction sensors are
      manually added or removed using the Signal Mast Logic <strong>Sensor</strong> tab. Select the
      direction sensor that corresponds to the direction to the destination mast and set the
      desired state to INACTIVE. As indicated above, the direction sensors are normally ACTIVE.
      This forces signal mast logic to set the mast aspect to Stop. When a transit is activated,
      the Forward or Reverse direction sensors for the sections in the transit are set to INACTIVE.
      This triggers signal mast logic to update the signal mast aspect.</p>

      <p>Also optionally each Section may have two <em>stopping sensors</em> that indicate when a
      train in the Section has reached the end of the Section by traveling in the forward direction
      or in the reverse direction. Stopping sensors should be physical sensors on the layout, for
      example infrared point detectors. For manual dispatching, these sensors may be displayed on a
      panel to indicate to the dispatcher when a train has reached the end of its allocation. For
      automatic running, these sensors may be used to stop a train before it reaches the end of its
      allocated Section, and before it overruns a red signal, if signals are present.</p>

      <h2 id="SignalMast">Using Signal Mast Logic with Sections</h2>

      <p>If your signaling is based on <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastLogicTable.shtml">Signal Mast Logic</a> and the
      associated logic has been generated using the Layout Editor, then it is possible to also have
      Sections automatically generated based upon that same logic.</p>

      <p>The tool to accomplish this can be found in the <strong>Signal Mast Logic Table</strong> |
      <strong>Tools</strong> | <strong>Generate Sections</strong>. Running this will immediately
      create Sections that each contain all of the Blocks between any already-defined Signal Mast
      Pairs. It will also set up each "Automatically Generated" Section so that they include those
      Blocks in the correct order, with the direction being set as FORWARD travel, going from the
      Source to the Destination Signal Mast. Please note that the Block details are not saved when
      the Panel is stored, but are re-created when the file is loaded.</p>

      <p>The tool will also automatically create forward and reverse direction Sensors and place
      them in the Section. However the Signal Mast Logic does not use the direction sensors and
      their creation is only there to allow validation of the Section (or inclusion by the user in
      unrelated Logix if desired). If desired, they can be added to the signal mast logic as
      described above.</p>

      <p>Sections generated with the tool will only have a pair of Entry Points and simply follow
      the Path between the two Signals.</p>

      <p>The details of the Optional Direction and Stopping Sensors are saved when the Panel file
      is stored.</p>

      <p>To use the Sections that have been built this way, you will next need to set up <a href=
      "Transits.shtml">Transits</a>. Following that, you will also need to set the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"><strong>Dispatcher</strong></a> to use
      SignalMast Logic via the Dispatcher's <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Options.shtml"><strong>Options</strong></a> menu.</p>

      <p>With stubs (UK sidings), a special procedure has been adopted. When working with signal
      mast logic, transits work best when the sections are all FORWARDS. If a reverse section is
      used the transit sometimes works, but sometimes does not. There is no signal mast section
      facing out of a stub, and a block section at the stub has been found to work well in transits
      emanating from the stub.</p>

      <p>When signal mast logic is automatically called, block sections for all stubs are also
      produced. Transits produced with the transit Create Tool (reached by right clicking signal
      masts in sequence), automatically use these block sections. Care must be taken to use the
      block sections (as opposed to using a signal mast logic section in the reverse direction)
      when using the 'Add Transit' method accessed by clicking the Transits option in the Tools
      Menu.</p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>

      <p>Sections build on JMRI's Blocks and Path structures. So before attempting to create any
      Sections, you should have Blocks and Paths fully initialized for your layout. A Layout Editor
      panel of your layout with Blocks assigned is required to create the necessary path
      information. See <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout
      Editor</a> for details on creating a Layout Editor panel.</p>

      <p>Layout blocking should be carefully planned, to provide "<em>reasonable</em>"
      Sections--Sections that make sense for a Dispatcher to allocate to a certain Train. For
      right-handed or left-handed Turnouts switching mainline track, for example, this usually
      means including the Turnout in the same Block as the track entering at the Turnout throat,
      and providing separate Blocks for continuing and diverging tracks. Some users prefer to have
      a Turnout in a separate Block, and that works fine also. From a Dispatching perspective,
      tracks of mainline Turnouts that branch to industries do not need to be separately blocked,
      but blocking here is acceptable. A layout blocking scheme that works well for Signals, should
      work fine for Sections also.</p>

      <p>Signals are not required for using Sections, but Sections will work fine with Signals
      installed. If Signals are installed, the direction Sensors included in Sections provide an
      easy way to set up simple APB signaling (see <a href="#SignalMast">above</a>).</p>

      <h2>How to setup Sections</h2>

      <h3>Creating and Displaying Sections</h3>

      <p>All the Sections that JMRI knows about can be viewed using the <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SectionTable.shtml">Section Table</a>. Select
      <strong>Sections</strong> in the <strong>Tables</strong> submenu of the
      <strong>Tools</strong> menu of the main JMRI program window. Sections can either be created
      manually from the Section Table pane, or they can be created automatically if you also plan
      to use <a href="#SignalMast">Signal Mast Logic</a>.</p>

      <h3>Section Table Controls</h3>

      <p>Below the Section Table there's an <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SectionAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a> button.</p>

      <p>The <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SectionTable.shtml#tools"><strong>Tools</strong></a> menu
      gives access to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Validate All Sections...</li>

        <li>Set Direction Sensors in Logic...</li>

        <li>Remove Direction Sensors from Logic...</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Creating a new Section</h3>

      <p>To Create a new Section, click the "<a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SectionAddEdit.shtml">Add..."</a> button.</p>

      <h3>Saving Sections to disk</h3>

      <p>Sections are kept in your <em>layout configuration</em>, along with Turnouts, Sensors,
      Signal Heads, Lights, control panel setup etc. To store this information on disk, allowing
      you to <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload it</a> next time
      you run JMRI, see <a href="../apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">Loading and Storing Your
      Work</a>.</p>
