      <h1>JMRI Fast Clocks - LocoNet Capability</h1>
      <p>A Digitrax
      LocoNet can contain its own fast clock timebase. This can be
      driven either by a DCS100/DCS200 command station, or by a
      separate fast clock module such as those made by Logic Rail
      Technologies. This page discusses how JMRI can either use or
      control the LocoNet fast clock.</p>

      <h2>Controlling the LocoNet clock</h2>

      <p>The "Clock Monitor" tool in the "LocoNet" menu provides
      a convenient way to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Read the current contents of the LocoNet fast
        clock</li>
        <li>Set the date and time</li>
        <li>Set the rate. Note that you can't explicitly pause a
        LocoNet clock, but you can stop it by setting the rate to
        zero.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are using a DCS100 or DCS200 command station to
      create your LocoNet fast clock, you may have noticed that it
      doesn't keep particularly good time. If you select the
      "Correct LocoNet Fast Clock Master", JMRI will adjust the
      rate of the LocoNet clock so that it keeps better time.</p>

      <h2>Using the LocoNet clock</h2>

      <p>You can also have JMRI use
      the LocoNet clock for it's own, internal timebase. This keeps
      the clocks that JMRI displays on the screen synchronized with
      the LocoNet clock, hence the displays on DT400 throttles,
      etc.</p>

      <p>To do this, select the "LocoNet Fast Clock sets Internal
      Clock" option on the LocoNet clock monitor window. Note that
      you should do this <em>before</em> opening the clock windows
      so that when you open the clock windows they connect to the
      correct timebase. Happy timekeeping!</p>
