      <h1>JMRI Fast Clocks - LocoNet Capability</h1>
      <p>A Digitrax LocoNet can
          contain it's own fast clock, driven by the DCS100,
          DCS200, or DCS50 command stations. A separate LocoNet
          fast clock is available from Logic Rail Technologies.
          JMRI can work with any of these, or with any clock that
          uses the standard Digitrax method to control fast clocks.</p>
      
      <p>This page discusses how JMRI can either use or
      control the LocoNet fast clock.</p>

      <h2>Controlling the LocoNet clock</h2>

      <p>The "Clock Monitor" tool in the "LocoNet" menu provides
      a convenient way to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Read the current contents of the LocoNet fast
        clock</li>
        <li>Set the date and time</li>
        <li>Set the rate. Note that you can't explicitly pause a
        LocoNet clock, but you can stop it by setting the rate to
        zero.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are using a DCS100 or DCS200 command station to
      create your LocoNet fast clock, you may have noticed that it
      doesn't keep particularly good time. If you select the
      "Correct LocoNet Fast Clock Master", JMRI will adjust the
      rate of the LocoNet clock so that it keeps better time.</p>

      <h2>Using the LocoNet clock</h2>

        <p>The recommended settings for running with LocoNet Fast Clock
          is: set <b>Time Source</b> to <b>Internal Computer
          Clock</b>, and check both the <b>Synchronize...</b> and
          <b>Correct...</b> options. However you can try other
          settings. If you use the internal computer clock as the
          time source, you will not be able to change the fast
          clock rate or the fast clock time from a throttle.</p>

      <p>You can also have JMRI use
      the LocoNet clock for it's own, internal timebase. This keeps
      the clocks that JMRI displays on the screen synchronized with
      the LocoNet clock, hence the displays on DT400 throttles,
      etc.</p>

      <p>To do this, select the "LocoNet Fast Clock sets Internal
      Clock" option on the LocoNet clock monitor window. Note that
      you should do this <em>before</em> opening the clock windows
      so that when you open the clock windows they connect to the
      correct timebase.</p>
      
          <p>If you use a Logic Rail Technologies fast clock, it
          should be set up as a slave clock, not as a master. You
          may notice that the Logic Rail Technologies fast clock
          lags behind by one fast clock minute. Be assured that the
          correct commands are being sent by JMRI. This lag, if
          present, is just an artifact of the Logic Rail clock's
          internal programming.</p>
