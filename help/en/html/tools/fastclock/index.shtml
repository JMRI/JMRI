<h1>JMRI&reg;: Fast Clock</h1>
    
JMRI provides two kinds of Fast Clock capability:

	<ul>
	<li>Internal - the computers clock provides the time information
	<li>External - the DCC system provides the time information
	</ul>

This help page describes the overall structure.  There
are separate pages for 
<a href="LocoNetClock.shtml">LocoNet clocks</a> and <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/nce/clockmon/ClockMonFrame.shtml">NCE clocks</a>.
As yet, we don't have interfaces for clocks in other DCC systems.

<p>
There are two different parts to consider:  A "Timebase" provides the basic
time information, while one or more displays show you what's going on.

<h2>Fast Clock Timebase</h2>
To create a Timebase, use the 
"<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/simpleclock/SimpleClockFrame.shtml">Setup Fast Clock</a>"
 item in the 
"Clocks" submenu under the JMRI "Tools" menu.  This gives you a window
where you can:
	<ul>
	<li>Select the timebase source to control (typically, this is the internal computer
	clock)
	<li>Set the rate at which the clock runs
	<li>Set the time
	<li>Start and stop the clock
	</ul>

<h2>Fast Clock Display</h2>
<p>
Once you have created a timebase by configuring it in that window, you 
can open clocks that will display on your screen. Currently, JMRI has three
types available:
	<ul>
	<li>Analog clock - the traditional circular clock with hands.  You can resize
	it by dragging the window edges.  There's also a pause/run button.
	<li>Nixie clock - a digital clock that looks like the old-style Nixie tubes
	<li>Panel clock - you can also embed a clock in a panel (instead of a separate window)
	from the panel editor.
	</ul>

<p>
When a clock is running, JMRI creates an internal sensor and a memory variable
that you can use to control and access the clock.  The ISCLOCKRUNNING sensor
controls whether the clock is running (ACTIVE) or stopped (INACTIVE). 
The IMCURRENTTIME memory contains the current fast-clock time, and can be easily accessed 
from Logix and scripts.

<p>
Happy timekeeping!
