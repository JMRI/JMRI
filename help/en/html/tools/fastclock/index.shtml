      <h1>JMRI: Fast Clocks</h1>

      <p>JMRI provides two kinds of Fast Clock capability:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Internal - the computers clock provides the time
        information</li>
        <li>External - the DCC system provides the time
        information</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This help page describes the overall structure. There
      are separate pages for <a href="LocoNetClock.shtml">LocoNet
      clocks</a> and <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrix/nce/clockmon/ClockMonFrame.shtml">
      NCE clocks</a>. As yet, we don't have interfaces for clocks
      in other DCC systems.</p>

      <p>There are two different parts to consider: A "Timebase"
      provides the basic time information, while one or more
      displays show you what's going on.</p>

      <h2>Fast Clock Timebase</h2>
      <p>To create a Timebase, use the
      "<a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/simpleclock/SimpleClockFrame.shtml">Set
      up Fast Clock...</a>" item in the "Clocks" submenu under the JMRI
      "Tools" menu. This gives you a window where you can:

      <ul>
        <li>Select the timebase source to control (typically, this
        is the internal computer clock)</li>
        <li>Set the rate at which the clock runs</li>
        <li>Set the time</li>
        <li>Start and stop the clock</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fast Clock Display</h2>

      <p>Once you have created a timebase by configuring it in that
      window, you can open clocks that will display on your screen.
      Currently, JMRI has three types available:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Analog clock - the traditional circular clock with
        hands. You can resize it by dragging the window edges.
        There's also a pause/run button.</li>
        <li>Nixie clock - a digital clock that looks like the
        old-style Nixie tubes</li>
        <li>Panel clock - you can also embed a clock in a panel
        (instead of a separate window) from the panel editor.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When a clock is running, JMRI creates an internal sensor
      and a memory variable that you can use to control and access
      the clock. The ISCLOCKRUNNING sensor controls whether the
      clock is running (ACTIVE) or stopped (INACTIVE). The
      IMCURRENTTIME memory contains the current fast-clock time,
      and can be easily accessed from Logix and scripts.</p>
      
      <p>Lights can be an easy way to set up Fast Clock Logic, see
      <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/LightAddEdit.shtml#lightcontrolfastclock"
        >Light Controller - Fast Clock Follower</a>.</p>

      <p>Happy timekeeping!</p>
