    <h1>JMRI: Aspect Signaling</h1>

      <p class="subtitle">Controlling model signals in a
      prototypical manner</p><a href="images/Rule282.png"><img src=
      "images/Rule282.png" height="241" width="159" align=
      "right"></a> Protoypical signal systems present "<a href=
      "index.shtml#aspect">Aspects</a>" to the engineer to tell him
      how to run his train. The "Stop" aspect, for example, is
      pretty simple: "Stop the train". The "Approach medium" aspect
      indicates something more complicated: "Proceed approaching
      next signal at medium speed". Each aspect has an associated
      "indication", which is usually codified in a railroad's Rule
      Book.

      <p>The picture to the right shows an example, Rule 282 from
      the 1946 AAR rule book (Aspect: Approach Medium).</p>

      <h2>JMRI Support for Aspect Signaling</h2>

      <p>A collection of plain instructions let you set up <a href=
      "SignalingSetup.shtml">Signaling in 7 Quick Steps</a>.</p>

      <p>Aspect Signaling is supported in JMRI using three of the
      Signaling Tools:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="SignalMasts.shtml">Signal Mast</a></b>
        objects represent an entire signal with one or more Signal
        Heads. A Signal Mast can operate all its Heads, as required
        to do full prototypical signaling based on aspects. When
        its Aspect is set to e.g. "Approach medium", JMRI handles
        the layout communication needed to make the signal on the
        layout display the right colors.<br>
        <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalMasts-num.png"><img src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalMasts-num.png"
        width="309" height="83" align="right"></a> Signal Masts are
        configured through the <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.shtml">
        Signal Mast Table</a>. You add new ones with the "Add..."
        button below the table, which takes you to the <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">
        "Add Signal Mast" window</a>. There you specify what kind
        of signaling system is to be used (see <a href=
        "#systems">the list below</a>), the specific signal type
        eg. "double searchlight" or "double head dwarf" and which
        Signal Heads this Mast is going to drive.<br>
        You can add a Signal Mast icon in the Panel Editor by right
        clicking at any location and choosing "Add item &gt; Signal
        Mast".<br>
        In Layout Editor enter the Signal Mast address and shift
        click on a turnout or anchor point on the panel where you
        want to place a Signal. The Signal Mast icon will display
        the images specified in the appearance definition for that
        particular Signal Mast type and system. The Signal icons
        displayed on your panel are part of a Signal System and
        they can't be changed individually by the user like Turnout
        icons.<br>
        Image on the right: Rule 281 Signal Icons from the AAR-2
        Signal System.
        <!-- icons from AAR-2 xml appearance definition xml March 2014 -->
         <a href=
        "http://jmri.org/xml/signals/AAR-1946/aspects.xml"><img src="images/AAR-2Clear.png"
        width="187" height="187" align="right" border=
        "1"></a><br></li>

        <li><b><a href="SignalGroups.shtml">Signal Groups</a></b>
        are used to define a number of Signal Heads, where only one
        Signal Head can be illuminated at any given time, depending
        upon the state of the associated Signal Mast and a set of
        conditions.<br>
        Signal Groups would be used where additional indicators are
        used to support the main Signal Mast, such as Junction,
        Route or Speed displays. These indicators provide
        additional information to the driver (US: Engineer) that is
        not given by the main Signal Mast. Such indicators are
        frequently seen in European and UK signaling.</li>

        <li>The <b><a href="SignalMastLogic.shtml">Signal Mast
        Logic</a></b> tool allows the Signaling Logic to be built
        up as pairs of conditionals between Signal Masts on the
        layout. The Signal Mast Logic will use the states of
        Blocks, Turnouts, Sensors and adjacent Signal Masts to
        determine what Aspect a Signal Mast should be
        displaying.<br>
        If the layout has been drawn up using the Layout Editor and
        Signal Masts have been placed on the panel using the
        various tools, then it is possible for all the Signal Mast
        Logic to be dynamically built, with little user
        intervention. For panels created with Control Panel Editor
        some of this information has to be entered manually.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b><a href="SignalHeads.shtml">Signal Head</a></b> objects
      in JMRI are not aware of their position on a mast and the
      Signaling System they are part of, so as individual objects
      they can't show Signal Aspects. Individually they can only be
      set to specific <a href=
      "index.shtml#appearance">Appearances</a> (colors), either
      from the Signal Head Table or via <a href=
      "#logix">Logix</a>.</p>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>

      <p>In short, a set of files for the selected Signaling System
      contains the basic code to determine which combinations are
      available in the <a href="SignalMastLogic.shtml">Signal Mast
      Logic</a> tool.<br>
      In the xml/signals directory located in the JMRI program
      directory, there is a directory for every Signaling System
      that has been defined, with one "aspects.xml" file which
      lists all of the possible Aspects plus a number of
      "appearance..." files (i.e.
      <i>appearance-one-searchlight.xml</i>), each of which
      describes the possible Aspects based on one Signal Mast type.
      These essentially say "if the next signal has an 'x' aspect,
      then the current one needs to show a 'y' aspect" (<a href=
      "DefineNewAspects.shtml">more details</a>).<br>
      The Signal Mast Logic table is then used to check which
      Signal Mast pairs are active in the Signal Mast Logic and
      whether the Aspect should <i>not</i> be 'Stop'. This is done
      by looking at Turnout positions (if applicable), Block
      occupancy and - possibly - Sensors. On the Signal Masts tab
      you might even specify additional Signal Masts to watch, e.g.
      for an Interlocking. For any Signal Mast, there can be 1 to n
      destination Signal Masts, one of which is active based on the
      positions of Turnouts connecting the protected Blocks.<br>
      If everything is OK, then the appropriate "appearance..."
      file for this Signal Mast type will be used by the Signal
      Mast Logic to assign a new Aspect based on the Aspect of the
      next Signal Mast.<br>
      This covers the basic workings in a very high level overview.

      <p>The most current list of Aspect Signal Systems supported
      in JMRI can be found at <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/xml/signals/">http://jmri.org/xml/signals/</a>.</p>

      <p>To create your own Signaling System Definition follow
      these <a href="DefineNewAspects.shtml">Instructions</a>. If
      you do create a new definition for another prototype railroad
      or era, after testing please contribute it back to the JMRI
      project so we can distribute it with future releases of the
      project for others to use. Like Decoder Definitions in
      DecoderPro, the more Signal System Definitions we have, the
      more useful the program becomes, and the more people spend
      time to improve it. We all win that way!</p>

      <h2>Code Access to Aspect Information</h2>

      <h3><a name="logix" id="logix">Logix</a></h3>

      <p>Signal Masts can be both tested (in Conditionals) and set
      (in Actions) via Logix. When you're editing a Logix
      Conditional or Action, you have to type the Signal Mast name
      and hit enter/return so that the program can look up the
      available Aspects for that particular Signal Mast. <a name=
      "mastscripting" id="mastscripting"></a></p>

      <h3>Scripting</h3>

      <p>A program (in Java or Python) can get access to Aspect
      information in two ways. If the code has a reference to a
      specific Signal Mast "m", it can use</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   m.getValidAspects()
</pre>to get the list of aspect names that this Signal Mast can
display. The program can then access the Signal System definition
with
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   SignalSystem sys = m.getSignalSystem()
</pre>and then enquire about properties of the aspect:
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   sys.getProperty("Clear","speed");
</pre>where the first argument is the aspect name (use, for
example, <code>m.getAspect()</code> to obtain the current one on
the mast) and the second is a specific property. Properties can be
defined programmatically via e.g.
<code>m.setProperty("Clear","speed","69");</code> or get loaded
automatically from elements in the <a href=
"DefineNewAspects.shtml">aspect.xml</a> file that defines the
specific signal system.

      <p>In addition to the global properties for an Aspect, there
      can also be local properties to a specific Signal Mast type.
      An example of this is the default icon image: The image for a
      two-head Signal Mast is different from that for a one-head
      Signal Mast, even if they both represent "Clear".</p>

      <p>To get those:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   m.getAppearanceMap().getProperty("Clear","imagelink");
</pre>In words, this is saying "Get the Appeance info for this
Signal Mast, and then check the imagelink property of the Clear
aspect".

      <p>Alternatively, if you know the name of the Signal System
      in use, a program can access it directly via the
      InstanceManager:</p>
      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   SignalSystem sys = InstanceManager.getDefault(SignalSystemManager.class).getSystem("basic");
</pre>
