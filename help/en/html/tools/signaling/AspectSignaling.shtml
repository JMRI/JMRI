<H1>JMRI: Aspect Signaling</H1>
<p class=subtitle>
Controling signaling in a prototypical manner
</p>

<a href="images/Rule282.png">

</a>
Protoypical signal systems present "aspects" to the engineer
to tell him how to run his train. 
The "Stop" aspect, for example, is pretty simple: Stop the train.  
The "Approach medium" aspect indicates something more complicated:
"Proceed approaching next signal at medium speed".  
Each aspect has an associated "indication", which is usually 
codified in the railroad's rule book.
<p>
Different signals may
show an aspect using different combinations of 
lights, semaphore positions, and/or placards; these are called
"appearances".  For example, the "stop" aspect will be a single red
light on a signal mast with one lamp, red over red lamps for a signal
mast with two lamps, etc.  

<h2>JMRI Support for Aspect Signaling</h2>

The original JMRI support for signals was via
"Signal Heads", which could be set to specific
appearances (colors).
<p>

Starting with JMRI 2.9.1 (early 2010), 
JMRI also contains 
"<a href="SignalMasts.shtml">Signal Mast</a>" 
objects that represent an
entire signal, not just an individual head.  A Signal Mast
can operate multiple heads, as required to do full prototypical
signaling based on aspects. When its "Aspect" is set to 
e.g. "Approach medium", it handles the layout operations 
needed to make the signals on the layout appear properly.

<p>
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.png">
   <img src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.png" 
        height="86" width="338" align="right">
</a>
Signal Masts are configured through the
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.shtml">Signal Mast Table</a>
You add new ones with the "Add..."  button
on the table, which takes you to the
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">"Add Signal Mast" window</a>.
To add a new signal mast, you specify 
what kind of signaling system it uses
(see <a href="#systems">below</a>),
the specific signal type like "double searchlight" or "double head dwarf",
and what signal heads it's going to drive.

<p>
>From the table, you can set individual signal masts to 
any aspect that they're able to
display by clicking in the "Aspect" column.

<p>
Signal Masts can be both tested (in Conditionals) and 
set (in Actions) via Logix.  When you're editing a Logix Conditional
or Action, you have to type the Signal Mast name and hit enter/return
so that the program can look up the possible aspects for that particular
signal mast.

<p>
You can also add a Signal Mast icon in the Panel Editor in the usual 
way.  The icon will display the images from the appearance definition 
for that particular signal mast. 

<h2>Signal Mast Logic</h2>
Starting with JMRI 2.11.7 (mid 2011), JMRI contains a "<a href="SignalMastLogic.shtml">Signal Mast Logic</a>" tool, that
allows the Signalling logic to be built up between Signal Masts on the layout.
The signal mast logic will use the states of blocks, turnouts, sensors and other
Signal Masts to determine what appearance a Signal Mast should be displaying.
<p>
If the layout has been drawn up on the layout editor and the SignalMasts have
been placed on the panel using the various tools, then it is possible for all 
the Signal Mast logic to be dynamically built, with little other user interaction.
<h2>Available Signaling Systems</h2>

There are instructions for creating your own signal system
definitions on
<a href="DefineNewAspects.shtml">a separate page</a>.
If you do create a new definition for another prototype railroad or era, 
please contribute it back to the JMRI project so we 
can distribute it with future releases of the project for
others to use.  Like decoder definitions in DecoderPro, the
more signal system definitions we have, the more useful the program
becomes, and the more people spend time to improve it. We all
win that way!

<h2>Access to Aspect Information from Code</h2>

A program (in Java or Python) can get access to 
aspect information two ways.  If it has a reference
to a specific SignalMast &quot;m&quot;, it can use
<code><pre>
   m.getValidAspects()
</pre></code>
to get the list of aspect names that this signal mast can display.
The program can then access the signal system definition with
<code><pre>
   SignalSystem sys = m.getSignalSystem()
</pre></code>
and then enquire about properties of the aspect:
<code><pre>
   sys.getProperty("Clear","speed");
</pre></code>
where the first argument is the aspect name (use, for example,
<code>m.getAspect()</code> to obtain the current one on the mast)
and the second is a specific property.  
Properties can be defined programatically via e.g.
<code>m.setProperty("Clear","speed","69");</code>
or get loaded automatically from elements in the 
<a href="DefineNewAspects.shtml">aspect.xml</a>
file that defines the specific signal system.

<p>
In addition to the global properties for an aspect, there
can also be properties local to a specific Signal Mast type.
An example of this is the default icon image:  The image for a 
two-head signal mast is different from that for a one-head signal mast,
even if they both represent "Clear".
<p>
To get those:
<code><pre>
   m.getAppearanceMap().getProperty("Clear","imagelink");
</pre></code>
In words, this is saying "Get the appeance info for this mast,
and then check the imagelink property of the Clear aspect".

<p>
Alternately, if you know the name of the signal system in use,
you can go directly to it via the InstanceManager:
<code><pre>
   SignalSystem sys = InstanceManager.signalSystemManagerInstance().getSystem("basic");
</pre></code>
