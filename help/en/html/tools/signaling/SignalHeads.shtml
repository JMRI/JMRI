      <h1>JMRI: Signal Heads</h1>

      <p>Signals Heads are how JMRI represents the individual lights/LEDs in a signal on your
      layout. JMRI handles Signal Heads as a specific kind of outputs that can be set to various
      colors: Red, Yellow, Green, Flashing Yellow, etc. Depending on the hardware used to connect
      your model signals tot the DCC system, the program deploys a different technique to turn each
      of these colors on or off.<br>
      Signal Heads may be used to build Signal Masts using the <a href="SignalMasts.shtml">Signal
      Masts Tool</a>. Depending on the way your signals on the layout are connected to the DCC
      system, Signal Heads are normally part of a Signal Mast, but <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">some signal hardware</a> is
      able to support multiple Aspects directly, and will not require the use of individual Signal
      Heads.</p>

      <!-- The following section is taken from, and should be kept consistent with -->
       <!-- help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalHeadTable.html -->
       All the Signal Heads that JMRI knows about can be referenced using the "Signal Head Table"
      tool in the Tools menu of most JMRI programs.
      <p>For more information on configuring Signal Heads with the Signal Heads Table, please see
      the <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalHeadTable.shtml">Signal Head Table
      help page</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="add">Creating a Signal Head</h3>
      <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalHeadAdd1.png"><img src=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalHeadAdd1.png" class="floatRight" width=
      "127" height="200" alt="Add Signal Head window figure"></a>
      <p>To define a new Signal Head, click on the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a> button at the bottom
      of the Signal Head Table. This will prompt you for the Signal Head type and whatever further
      information is needed for the selected type.<br>
      There's more information on the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">Adding Signal Heads help
      page</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="edit">Editing an Existing Signal Head</h3>

      <p>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> button at the right of the Signal Head Table to open
      the Edit Signal Head window.</p>

      <p>Once a Signal Head has been defined, its connection Type and System Name can't be changed.
      You can ignore Signal Heads that you've defined and don't use; they don't hurt anything. If
      preferred you can delete a Signal Head from the Signal Head Table by clicking the Delete
      button. Save a copy of the JMRI Configuration file as a backup first and carefully read the
      warning message that pops up if the Signal Head is used by other parts of JMRI!</p>

      <h3>Controlling a Signal Head</h3>
      Apart from manually setting the Appearance of a Signal Head from the Signal Head Table by
      clicking on the current state of a head in the Appearance column and selecting a state from
      the combo box that opens, Signal Heads can be automatically controlled by JMRI in various
      ways, including:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="AspectSignaling.shtml">Aspect Signaling</a>, the most versatile method to
          display various prototype signaling Rule Books of many US and foreign railroads, driven
          automatically by the state of Turnouts and (Occupancy) Sensors;
        </li>

        <li>Via <a href="../Logix.shtml">Logix</a>, a graphical way of controlling Signal Heads
        with simple logic statements;
        </li>

        <li>By <a href="../scripting/index.shtml">Scripts</a>, using a full programming language to
        do whatever you'd like;
        </li>

        <li>Using the <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/blockboss/BlockBossFrame.shtml">Simple
        Signal Logic</a> Tool, for basic ABS signaling of the North American type (more easily
        available via the first method).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Saving and Reloading Configuration</h2>

      <p>The Signal Head information is kept in your <em>layout configuration</em>, along with
      Turnouts, Lights, Sensors, control panel setup etc.<br>
      To save this information on disk, allowing you to <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload it</a> next time you run
      JMRI, see <a href="../../apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">Loading and Storing Your Work</a>.</p>

      <p>For more information on creating and displaying panels, including how to show Signals on
      your Panels, please see the <a href="../../apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels help
      pages</a>.</p>
