      <h1>JMRI: Signal Heads</h1>

      <p>Signals Heads are how JMRI represents the individual
      lights/LEDs in a signal on your layout. JMRI handles Signal
      Heads as a specific kind of outputs that can be set to
      various colors: Red, Yellow, Green, Flashing Yellow, etc.
      Depending on the hardware used to connect your model signals
      tot the DCC system, the program deploys a different technique
      to turn each of these colors on or off.<br>
      Signal Heads may be used to build Signal Masts using the
      <a href="SignalMasts.shtml">Signal Masts Tool</a>. Depending
      on the way your signals on the layout are connected to the
      DCC system, Signal Heads are normally part of a Signal Mast,
      but <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">
      some signal hardware</a> is able to support multiple Aspects
      directly, and will not require the use of individual Signal
      Heads. <a name="table" id="table"></a></p>

      <h3>The Signal Head Table</h3><a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SigHeadTable.png"><img src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SigHeadTable.png"
      align="right" width="447" height="177" hspace="0" vspace="0"
      alt="Signal Head Table figure"></a> 
      <!-- The following section is taken from, and should be kept consistent with -->
       
      <!-- help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalHeadTable.html -->
       All the Signal Heads that JMRI knows about can be referenced
      using the "Signal Head Table" tool in the Tools menu of most
      JMRI programs.

      <p>For more information on configuring Signal Heads with the
      Signal Heads Table, please see the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalHeadTable.shtml">
      Signal Head Table help page</a>. <a name="add" id=
      "add"></a></p>

      <h3>Creating a Signal Head</h3><a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalHeadAdd1.png"><img src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalHeadAdd1.png"
      align="right" width="127" height="200" hspace="0" vspace="0"
      alt="Add Signal Head window figure"></a>

      <p>To define a new Signal Head, click on the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
      button at the bottom of the Signal Head Table. This will
      prompt you for the Signal Head type and whatever further
      information is needed for the selected type.<br>
      There's more information on the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">Adding
      Signal Heads help page</a>.</p>

      <h3><a name="edit" id="edit">Editing an Existing Signal
      Head</a></h3>

      <p>Click on the <b>Edit</b> button
      at the right of the Signal Head Table to open the Edit Signal
      Head window.</p>

      <p>Once a Signal Head has been defined, its connection Type
      and System Name can't be changed. You can ignore Signal Heads
      that you've defined and don't use; they don't hurt anything.
      If preferred you can delete a Signal Head from the Signal
      Head Table by clicking the Delete button. Save a copy of the
      JMRI Configuration file as a backup first and carefully read
      the warning message that pops up if the Signal Head is used
      by other parts of JMRI!</p>

      <h3>Controlling a Signal Head</h3>Apart from manually setting
      the Appearance of a Signal Head from the Signal Head Table by
      clicking on the current state of a head in the Appearance column
      and selecting a state from the combo box that opens,
      Signal Heads can be automatically controlled by JMRI in
      various ways, including:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="AspectSignaling.shtml">Aspect Signaling</a>,
        the most versatile method to display various prototype
        signaling Rule Books of many US and foreign railroads,
        driven automatically by the state of Turnouts and
        (Occupancy) Sensors;</li>

        <li>Via <a href="../Logix.shtml">Logix</a>, a graphical way
        of controlling Signal Heads with simple logic
        statements;</li>

        <li>By <a href="../scripting/index.shtml">Scripts</a>,
        using a full programming language to do whatever you'd
        like;</li>

        <li>Using the <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/blockboss/BlockBossFrame.shtml">
        Simple Signal Logic</a> Tool, for basic ABS signaling of
        the North American type (more easily available via the
        first method).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Saving and Reloading Configuration</h2>The Signal Head
      information is saved as part of the JMRI configuration in an
      XML file, along with control panel setup and similar stuff.
      For more information on creating and displaying panels,
      including how to show signals on your panels, please see the
      <a href="../../apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels pages</a>.
