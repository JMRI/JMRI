      <h1>JMRI: Signal Heads</h1>

      <p>Signals Heads are how JMRI represents the individual
      lights/LEDs in a signal on your layout. JMRI handles Signal
      Heads as a specific kind of outputs that can be set to
      various colors: Red, Yellow, Green, Flashing Yellow, etc.
      Depending on the hardware used to connect your model signals
      tot the DCC system, the program deploys a different technique
      to turn each of these colors on or off.<br>
      Signal Heads may be used to build Signal Masts using the
      <a href="SignalMasts.shtml">Signal Masts Tool</a>. Depending
      on the way your signals on the layout are connected to the
      DCC system, Signal Heads are normally part of a Signal Mast,
      but <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">
      some signal hardware</a> is able to support multiple Aspects
      directly, and will not require the use of individual Signal
      Heads. <a name="table" id="table"></a></p>

      <h3>The Signal Head Table</h3><a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SigHeadTable.png"><img src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SigHeadTable.png"
      align="right" width="447" height="177" hspace="0" vspace="0"
      alt="Signal Head Table figure"></a> 
      <!-- The following section is taken from, and should be kept consistent with -->
       
      <!-- help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalHeadTable.html -->
       All the Signal Heads that JMRI knows about can be referenced
      using the "Signal Head Table" tool in the Tools menu of most
      JMRI programs.

      <p>For more information on configuring Signal Heads with the
      Signal Heads Table, please see the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalHeadTable.shtml">
      Signal Head Table help page</a>. <a name="add" id=
      "add"></a></p>

      <h3>Creating a Signal Head</h3><a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalHeadAdd1.png"><img src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalHeadAdd1.png"
      align="right" width="127" height="200" hspace="0" vspace="0"
      alt="Add Signal Head window figure"></a>

      <p>To define a new Signal Head, click on the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
      button at the bottom of the Signal Head Table. This will
      prompt you for the Signal Head type and whatever further
      information is needed for the selected type.<br>
      There's more information on the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">Adding
      Signal Heads help page</a>.</p>

      <h3><a name="edit" id="edit">Editing an Existing Signal
      Head</a></h3>

      <p>Click on the <b>Edit</b> button
      at the right of the Signal Head Table to open the Edit Signal
      Head window.</p>

      <p>Once a Signal Head has been defined, its connection Type
      and System Name can't be changed. You can ignore Signal Heads
      that you've defined and don't use; they don't hurt anything.
      If preferred you can delete a Signal Head from the Signal
      Head Table by clicking the Delete button. Save a copy of the
      JMRI Configuration file as a backup first and carefully read
      the warning message that pops up if the Signal Head is used
      by other parts of JMRI!</p>

      <h3>Controlling a Signal Head</h3>Apart from manually setting
      the Appearance of a Signal Head from the Signal Head Table by
      clicking on the current state of a head in the Appearance column
      and selecting a state from the combo box that opens,
      Signal Heads can be automatically controlled by JMRI in
      various ways, including:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="AspectSignaling.shtml">Aspect Signaling</a>,
        the most versatile method to display various prototype
        signaling Rule Books of many US and foreign railroads,
        driven automatically by the state of Turnouts and
        (Occupancy) Sensors;</li>

        <li>Via <a href="../Logix.shtml">Logix</a>, a graphical way
        of controlling Signal Heads with simple logic
        statements;</li>

        <li>By <a href="../scripting/index.shtml">Scripts</a>,
        using a full programming language to do whatever you'd
        like;</li>

        <li>Using the <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/blockboss/BlockBossFrame.shtml">
        Simple Signal Logic</a> Tool, for basic ABS signaling of
        the North American type (more easily available via the
        first method).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Saving and Reloading Configuration</h2>

      <p>The Signal Head information is kept in your <i>layout
      configuration</i>, along with Turnouts, Lights, Sensors,
      control panel setup etc.<br>
      To save this information on disk, allowing to <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload
      it</a> next time you run JMRI, use <b>Store Configuration...</b>
      in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Signal Head Table (or
      other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store
      Panel...</b> in the <b>Panel</b> menu.</p>
      <p>For more information on creating and displaying panels,
      including how to show signals on your panels, please see the
      <a href="../../apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels pages</a>.</p>
