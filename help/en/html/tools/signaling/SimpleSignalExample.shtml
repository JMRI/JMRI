      <h1>JMRI: Simple Signal Logic Example</h1>

      <p class="important">Don't use the Simple Signal Logic (SSL)
      Tool when you have already built Signal Masts and the more
      advanced Signal Mast Logic in the same Panel/Configuration
      file.</p>

      <p>This page provides an example of using the JMRI <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/blockboss/BlockBossFrame.shtml">Simple
      Signal Logic</a> (in short: SSL) to control Signals Heads
      connected to a Digitrax SE8C board. This also works for other
      types of <i>single head</i> hardware signals, including LEDs
      connected to stationary decoders, C/MRI systems, etc.<br>
      Please try our <a href="#example1">ready-to-use example</a>
      as a starter for <a href="#setup">setting up your own
      SSL</a>.</p>

      <p>Modeling railroad signaling on a layout can be done in
      many different ways, ranging from "stoplights" to complete
      emulation of a particular prototype's signaling rule book.
      For more information on the various possibilities, please see
      the <a href="index.shtml">JMRI Signaling help page</a>.
      <a id="example1" name="example1"></a></p>

      <h2>Predefined example</h2>

      <p>A predefined SSL example is provided in the JMRI
      installation (see the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/download">download page</a> for information
      on downloading). To use this example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start the PanelPro program, and select "Preferences..."
        from the Edit menu (from the PanelPro menu on OS X). On the
        pane that opens, click Connections at left and then select
        "Digitrax" as the System Manufacturer and "LocoNet
        Simulator" as the System Connection. Click the <b>Save</b>
        button at the bottom left of the Preferences pane and quit
        PanelPro. This will let you use the example (which uses
        LocoNet addresses for Signal Heads, Turnouts and Sensors)
        even when your computer is not connected to a layout of any
        kind.</li>

        <li>Restart the PanelPro program.</li>

        <li>From the "Panels" menu, select "Open Panels..." and
        navigate to the file "SE8cSignalExample.xml" in the
        <a href="../../../../../xml/layout/">JMRI/xml/layout/</a>
        directory. Note that you may have to look around for this
        file; it's in the same place that you installed the
        program.<a href="images/StartPanel.png"><img src=
        "images/StartPanel.png" align="right" width="317" height=
        "173" hspace="0" vspace="2" alt=
        "Demo screen at startup"></a></li>

        <li>You should now see a simple schematic Panel for a
        layout consisting of a loop of track and one passing siding
        (like the non-functioning image to the right; click to
        enlarge).

          <p>Because there's no connection to a real layout, the
          status of the Sensors and Turnouts isn't initially known.
          Our example shows this by displaying the Sensor icons as
          Red, and the Turnout icons as [?] meaning "not connected
          either way". Since the Simple Signal Logic isn't sure yet
          whether Blocks are occupied nor how Turnouts are set, it
          shows a "Red" Appearance on all Signal Heads.</p>

          <p>You can click on your Panel icons to change the
          occupancy and turnout status, or use another tool (e.g.
          the Turnout Table) to do that.</p>

          <p>Click on each of the Turnout icons to set them
          "Closed". Click on the Sensor icons to set them
          "Unoccupied", which is shown as a grey circle ("Occupied"
          would be indicated by a yellow circle).</p>
        </li>

        <li>The display should now look like the image to the
        right. <a href="images/SensorsCleared.png"><img src=
        "images/SensorsCleared.png" align="right" width="317"
        height="173" hspace="0" vspace="2" alt=
        "Demo screen in clear state"></a> Both signals on the
        passing siding are Red, as the Turnouts are thrown against
        them. All the signals on the mainline show a Green
        Appearance.

          <p>If you "hover" the cursor over an item on your Panel,
          a tooltip will pop up with information about the item.
          For example, a Turnout might pop up "Turnout 1 (LT1)".
          LT1 is the "System Name" for that Turnout. In this case,
          it means "LocoNet Turnout with address 1". "Turnout 1" is
          the "User Name", which can be anything you want it to be
          as long as it is unique on your Panel. You can edit these
          from the "Turnout Table" accessed from the Tools &gt;
          Tables &gt; Turnouts menu.<br>
          Signal Heads and Sensors are identified using similar
          names (see the <a href=
          "../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">JMRI help page on
          System Names and Naming</a>).</p>
        </li>

        <li>You can now click on the Sensor icons to learn how the
        Signals react to the presence of a train. For example, the
        image to the right shows a train entering the passing
        siding from the left side. It's about to encounter a Yellow
        signal upon entering the siding, which tells it to be
        prepared to stop for a Red signal at the far end of the
        siding.<br>
        <a href="images/SensorTuroutsSet.png"><img src=
        "images/SensorTuroutsSet.png" align="right" width="317"
        height="173" hspace="0" vspace="2" alt=
        "Demo screen with two trains"></a> Note that the rear of
        this train is protected by a Red signal, which in turn is
        protected by a Yellow signal in the preceding Block.
        Another train is just leaving onto the main going to the
        right.</li>

        <li>If you're interested in how the program would
        communicate with a real Digitrax SE8c signaling board, you
        can open the "Monitor LocoNet" tool from the LocoNet
        menu.<br>
          In the pane that opens, you will see that clicking on a
          Turnout icon sends a LocoNet message to move that
          Turnout. Clicking on a Sensor icon sends a message as if
          a BDL16 sensor channel had seen a change in occupancy. If
          either of those messages results in a change to the
          signals, the program will send messages to the
          corresponding SE8c channels to change their output to
          match. For example, when the train in the previous image
          enters the block on the right side (Block 1), the
          messages are:
          <pre>
<!-- Updated for panel included in JMRI 4.1.3 -->
  Sensor LS1  (Block 1) is Hi.  (BDL16 #1, DS1; DS54/64/SE8c #1, AuxA/A1/DS01)
  Requesting Switch at LT285 () to Thrown (output On).
  Requesting Switch at LT291 () to Thrown (output On).
  Requesting Switch at LT282 () to Thrown (output On).
</pre>These three switch messages set Signal Heads 4C, 5B and 4A to
Red, Red and Yellow respectively.
        </li>

        <li>To learn how signals are configured in SSL, open the
        "Simple Signal Logic" item in the Tools menu.<a href=
        "../../../images/SslExample.png"><img src=
        "../../../images/SslExample.png" align="right"
          width="452" height="287" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt=
          "Simple Signal Logic Window"></a> In the pane that opens,
          enter a Signal (Head) Name, e.g. "Section 5A", in the top
          text field and hit the Return key. You should get
          something like the image to the right (click to enlarge).
          "Section 5A" is the name of the Signal (Head) protecting
          Turnout "LT2", the right-hand entrance to the passing
          siding.

          <ul>
            <li>It is defined here as an "On Facing-Point Turnout"
            signal.</li>

            <li>It protects Sensor "LS7" by turning Red when the
            Sensor detects a train in the Block monitored by
            LS7.</li>

            <li>It watches the status of Turnout "LT2".<br>
            To Protect Signal: When Turnout LT2 is "Closed", signal
            "Section 5A" will be Yellow when Signal Head LH261,
            located on the mainline between the turnouts, is
            Red.<br>
            And Protect Signal: When Turnout LT2 is "Thrown",
            signal "Section 5A" will be Yellow when Signal Head
            LH263 at the entrance to the passing siding is
            Red.</li>

            <li>The "With Flashing Yellow" checkbox isn't selected
            in our example, but if it was, signal "Section 5A"
            would protect a Yellow signal further on by displaying
            a Flashing Yellow.</li>

            <li>If you check the "Distant Signal" box, the Signal
            Head you're controlling here is programmed to show the
            same or a more restrictive Appearance as the next
            signal, instead of possibly one faster. Instead of
            showing Yellow before a Red, it will show a Red.</li>
          </ul>You can change any of these settings and click
          "Apply" at the bottom of the pane to put them into
          effect, then click on the example Panel to see how the
          new settings work.
        </li>
      </ul><a name="setup" id="setup"></a>

      <h2>Setting up your own example</h2>The complete set of steps
      involved in creating this example are:

      <ol>
        <li>Launch and configure the PanelPro application. Restart
        it to have your preferences take effect.<br>
        For more information on launching and configuring PanelPro,
        please see the <a href=
        "../../apps/PanelPro/index.shtml">PanelPro help
        page</a>.</li>

        <li>Tell the program about your Sensors:

          <ul>
            <li>From the Tools menu, open the "Tables" &gt;
            "Sensors" tool.</li>

            <li>If you have a Digitrax DCC system with your
            occupancy detectors connected to LocoNet, just power
            the track Off and On using either a DT-series throttle
            or the "Power Control..." pane from the Tools menu.
            PanelPro will capture all sensor addresses from the
            resulting LocoNet traffic.</li>

            <li>For layouts with a different System Connection, use
            the "Add..." button at the bottom of the Sensor Table
            to create the needed sensors.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Save your work by selecting "Store Panels..." from the
        "Panels" menu, typing a filename, and hitting "Save
        Panels". (You might want to do this often!)</li>

        <li>Tell the program about your computer-driven Turnouts:

          <ul>
            <li>From the Tools menu, open the "Tables" &gt;
            "Turnouts" tool.</li>

            <li>If you have a Digitrax DCC system, just throw or
            close each Turnout from a throttle. PanelPro will
            capture the Turnout addresses from the resulting
            LocoNet traffic.</li>

            <li>You can also use the "Add..." button on the Turnout
            Table to open a pane to enter new Turnouts.</li>

            <li>The "Turnout Control..." pane, found in the Tools menu,
            also creates a new Turnout entry for every turnout
            address you operate.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>If you have Signal Heads connected to "turnout-type"
        outputs, tell the program about those Turnout addresses too
        (SE8C users skip this step).

        <a name="definesignals" id="definesignals"></a></li>
        <li>
          Tell PanelPro
          how your Signal Heads are addressed:<a href=
          "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SigHeadTable.png"><img src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SigHeadTable.png"
          align="right" width="299" height="118" hspace="0" vspace=
          "0" alt="Signal Head Table Figure"></a>

          <ul>
            <li>From the PanelPro <b>Tools</b> menu, open the <b>Tables
            &gt; Signals &gt; Signal Heads</b> tool.</li>

            <li>Click the "<a href=
            "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>"
            button at the left bottom of the table to pop a pane.
            At the top are several choices for your type of Signal
            Head driver:

              <dl>
                <dt>Triple Output</dt>

                <dd>A Signal Head Connection Type with
                red/yellow/green lights that are driven by three
                separate outputs. The outputs are driven by JMRI
                turnout logic, and appear in the Turnout Table.<br>
                To configure one of these, enter the name you want
                to give it (typically something like "IH2"), and
                the address numbers of the three outputs that drive
                the lamps (like "258" etc.).</dd>

                <dt>Double Output</dt>

                <dd>A Signal Head Connection Type with lights that
                are driven by two output connections. The two
                outputs drive red and green lights separately;
                PanelPro will turn them both On to make yellow. The
                outputs are driven by JMRI turnout logic, and
                appear in the Turnout Table.<br>
                To configure one of these, enter the name you want
                to give it (typically something like "IH2"), and
                the address numbers of the two outputs that drive
                the lamps (like "258" etc.).</dd>

                <dt>SE8c 4 Aspect</dt>

                <dd>This Connection Type is for Signal Heads driven
                by a Digitrax SE8c decoder.<br>
                Enter the lower of the two Turnout addresses that
                this Signal Head responds to. For example, if it's
                the first Signal Head on your first SE8c board, you
                can control it by setting Turnouts 257 and 258 with
                your throttle. Enter "257" in the Turnout Number
                box on the pane.<br>
                Note: The SE8c board should be configured so that
                the "4th aspect" is "Dark"; JMRI will handle any
                flashing that's needed.</dd>

                <dt>And many more...</dt>

                <dd>Other signal driver options are "DCC Signal
                Decoder" and "Acela", among many others (you may
                have to scroll up or down to see them all).<br>
                See the <a href="SignalHeads.shtml">Signal Heads
                help page</a> for more information an each.</dd>
              </dl>Once you've set the options, click "OK". You can
              use this pane repeatedly to enter as many Signal
              Heads as you have.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Configure your signaling logic using the Simple Signal
        Logic (SSL) Tool.<br>
          Open the "Simple Signal Logic" tool from the "Tools"
          menu. You should get a pane with a number of fields:
          <a href="../../../images/SslExample.png"><img src=
          "../../../images/SslExample.png" align="right"
          width="452" height="287" hspace="2" vspace="0" alt=
          "Simple Signal Logic Window"></a>

          <ul>
            <li>In the top box, enter the name of the Signal Head
            you want to configure.</li>

            <li>The radio buttons below that select one of four
            possible uses for this signal:

              <ul>
                <li>"On Single Block" - this signal protects one
                end of a straight through block, with no signaled
                turnouts</li>

                <li>"Main Leg of (trailing-point) Turnout" - this
                signal is along the main route through a turnout,
                which is defined as the direction taken by trains
                when the turnout is "Closed". It's protecting the
                frog of the turnout so that trains will stop before
                running through a turnout set against them.</li>

                <li>"Diverging Leg of (trailing-point) Turnout" -
                this signal is along the diverging route through a
                turnout, which is defined as the direction taken by
                trains when the turnout is set to "Thrown". It's
                protecting the frog of the turnout so that trains
                will stop before running through a turnout set
                against them.</li>

                <li>"On Facing-Point Turnout" - this signal is
                protecting the points-end of a turnout. Depending
                on whether the Turnout you watch is "Thrown" or
                "Closed", the train will take one of two different
                routes, and the Signal will protect different next
                Blocks, which you fill in next.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>If you want the Signal Head to go Red when a Sensor
            shows Occupied (sensor active), enter the Sensor Name
            in the next box.</li>

            <li>If this signal is protecting travel in the trailing
            point direction through a turnout, you can have the
            Signal Head show Red if the turnout is thrown against
            the train. To do this, enter the Turnout Name to be
            monitored in the 3rd box, and select whether the Signal
            Head should be Red when the Turnout is either Thrown or
            Closed.</li>

            <li>If you want multi-block logic, e.g. Absolute Block
            Signaling "Light", enter the name of the following
            Signal Head in the last box. When that Signal Head
            shows Red, the one you're now configuring will be set
            to Yellow to warn the engineer that the train must be
            able to stop at the next signal.<br>
            <br>
            If you'd like to give an additional warning, check the
            "With Flashing Yellow" checkbox. In that case, the
            signal before a Red will show Yellow, and the signal
            before that Yellow will show a Flashing Yellow.<br>
            <i>We suggest you use the newer <a href=
            "AspectSignaling.shtml">Aspect Based Signaling</a>
            instead of SSL for any more complex setup.</i></li>

            <li>Once you've set the options, click "Apply". You can

        <li>Once you save your work by selecting "Store
        Configuration and Panels To File..." from the File menu,
        you're done!</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Now try out your Simple Signal Logic by operating your
      layout.<br>
      Although it's a lot less fun than actually running the
      layout, you can also test your Simple Signal Logic by
      changing Turnout and Sensor states on the computer itself.
      Just click on the status information in one of the Tables to
      change it. For example, if Turnout "LT23" is showing "Thrown"
      in the Turnout Table, click on that word to change it to
      "Closed". The signal icon will update to the new
      Appearance.</p>

      <p>You can create a small Control Panel to do this
      graphically. For more info on how to do that, see the
      <a href="../../apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels help
      page</a>.</p>
