      <h1>JMRI: Signal Mast Logic</h1>

      <h2>Introduction to SML</h2>

      <div class="para">
        JMRI Signal Mast Logic (in short: SML) allows you to build
        up a set of criteria for a Signal Mast as to what Aspect
        it should be displaying for a specific route through to a
        destination Signal Mast.

        <p>Each Signal Mast Logic is built from a source and
        destination Signal Mast pair, along with a series of
        Blocks, Turnouts and Sensors between the two Signal Masts
        and the state that they must be in for the source Signal
        Mast to be released from a "Danger" or "Stop" Aspect.</p>

        <h3>Example 1</h3>
        <img src="images/logic1.png" width="437" height=
        "92" align="right">

        <p>In this first example, you have a source Signal Mast
        SM20, and two destination Signal Masts: SM22 and
        SM23.<br>
        The logic behind signaling pair SM20 to SM23 is that Blocks
        2 &amp; 3 must be unoccupied, and Turnout IT1 must be set
        to "Closed". Once those criteria are met Signal Mast SM20
        will be released from "Danger" to "Caution", if Signal Mast
        SM23 was set to "Caution" then SM20 would be set to
        "Proceed" and show a Green Aspect. As soon as Block 2 or 3
        becomes Active or Turnout 1 is set to Thrown, the Signal
        Mast SM20 is set back to "Danger".</p>

        <p>Each Signal Mast pair must be directly reachable from
        the other, without any other other Signal Mast in-between
        in the same direction.</p>

        <h3>Example 2</h3>
        <img src="images/logic2.png" width="511" height=
        "93" align="right">

        <p>In this second example, a Signal Mast Logic from SM20 to
        SM24 would be invalid as SM23 is in between the two. You
        would have to create two separate Signal Mast Logics, one
        as in example 1 for SM20 to SM23, the second for SM23 to SM24.</p>

        <p>Which Aspect our source Signal Mast displays after being
        released from "Danger" is firstly determined by the Aspect
        mapping that has been defined in the Signal Mast Appearance
        definition file. If there is only one Aspect that could be
        displayed, then the Signal Mast will be set to that
        Aspect.<br>
        However if multiple Aspects could potentially be displayed
        then the logic looks at two areas to determine the
        resulting Aspect to be displayed:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Diverging route
            <ul>
              <li>If there are Aspects for a Diverging route and
              any of the Turnouts on the path are set to Thrown
              then it will use the Aspect for a Diverging
              route.</li>

              <li>If none of the Turnouts on the route are set to
              Thrown, then the Aspect that is not designated as a
              Diverging aspect will be used.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Block/Signal Speed
            <ul>
              <li>If the Diverging route is not available on the
              signal Aspects, or it does not return a single
              potential Aspect, then the speed of the Block and
              speed rating of the Aspect are used.<br>
              Each Aspect and Block can be configured with a Speed
              value. The Signal Mast Logic will take the lowest
              Speed defined on the Blocks in the route and choose
              the Aspect with the highest Speed which is under the
              routes lowest speed. I.e. if the routes lowest Speed
              is 65 mph, then it will choose the Aspect that has a
              speed equal or less than 65 mph.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In addition to being able to specify the Turnouts,
        Blocks and Sensors that make up a Signal Mast Logic, you
        can also specify which other Signal Masts must be set to a
        specific Aspect before the source Signal Mast can be
        released. In general, there should be no need to add extra
        Signal Masts in the Signal Mast Logic as the route between
        all the different source mast to destination mast Logis
        pair should have unique criteria. However there are certain
        situation such as where two tracks crossover on the same
        level where a conflicting route could be set. Therefore to
        get around this, the Signal Mast or Masts that are
        protecting the crossover should be part of each others
        criteria.</p>

        <h2>Manual and Auto Generated Logic Information</h2>
        <p>The Signal Mast Logic window holds two areas showing Block
        and Turnout information: the first is user generated, the
        second is where a tool such as used with the Layout Editor
        (<a href="#autologic">see below</a>) has automatically
        built up a set of Blocks or Turnouts from the panel layout
          as signaling criteria.</p>

        <p>Both sets of information are used by JMRI to determine
        if a Signal Mast can be released or not, however the
        manually created information has a higher priority over the
        automatically generated information thus allowing the user
        to over-ride what the system has determined.</p>

        <p>The automatically generated information is not saved
        with the rest of the panel information, but the manually
        generated user information is. If the Layout Editor is
        being used to base the Signal Mast Logic on (<a href=
        "#autologic">see below</a>) then JMRI will rediscover this
        information from the panel each time it is loaded, and if
        any changes have been saved in the meantime they will be
        discovered. Please note, that this re-generation of
        information is not done on the "fly" when a Layout Editor
        panel is changed and saved without exiting JMRI.</p>

        <h2>Using the Layout Editor for Signal Mast Logic</h2>
        <p>By using the Layout Block Editor, it is possible to have the
        Signal Mast Logic determine the signaling pairs, along with
        the Blocks and Turnouts that make up the criteria. This can
        be done across all the Signal Masts on the Layout Editor or
          on a source Signal Mast basis.</p>

        <p>It has the advantage that if the Layout Editor panel is
        changed, JMRI will discover this change when the panel is
        reloaded and use the new Block and Turnout information.
        Please be aware that the re-discover at load process will
        not discover any new Signal Logic pairs or remove invalid
        Signal Logic pairs, it will simply update the information
        between existing pairs.</p>

        <h3>Placing Signal Masts</h3>
        <p>Signal Masts can be placed at
        Turnouts, anchor points and level crossings, but only where
          there is a boundary between two different layout blocks.</p>

        <p>To add a Signal Mast using a Layout Editor Panel, right
        click on the Turnout, level crossing or anchor point and if
        a block boundary exists you will be given the option to
        "Set Signal Mast..."</p>

        <h3>Example 3</h3>
        <img src="images/popup.png" height="316" width=
        "300" align="right">

        <p>You will then be presented with a fresh window that
        allows you to enter in the name of the Signal Mast that
        will protect a boundary between two blocks.<br>
        For turnouts and crossings, you can only add a Signal Mast
        for the boundary going into the turnout or crossing, it is
        not possible to add a Signal Mast for the boundary going
        out from the turnout or crossing. E.g. if block A is the
        section of track attached to the Turnout and the Turnout is
        in block B, you can only add a Signal Mast that faces into
        block A that protects block B; you can not add a Signal
        Mast that faces into block B to protect block A.</p>

        <p>Using the Panel Editor and not having defined Blocks,
        the Signal Mast Logic can't be automatically discovered as
        this type of Panel only displays individual icons over a
        layout graphic so you have to manually add the connections
        as Blocks using the Blocks Tool or add Signal Logic Pairs
        in the Signal Logic Table for every possible
        connection.<br>
        Manually add Signal Icons to your panel by right-clicking
        and choosing "Add icon".</p>

        <h2><a name="autologic" id=
                "autologic">Create Signal Mast Logic</a></h2>
        <p>Signal Mast Logic can automatically be generated in three
          different ways:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The first method is to build it on a Signal Mast by
          Signal Mast basis. This can be done by selecting "Signal
          Mast Logic" from the pop up menu for the Signal Mast icon
          on the panel. After click on the "Discover" button, the
          system will go and find all potential destination Signal
          Masts that are valid from the selected Signal Mast.<br>
          <img src="images/discover.png" width="502" height=
          "209"></li>

          <li><img src="images/pairs.png" width="308"
                   height="125" align="right">
          The second method is from the <b>Tools &gt; Auto
          generate Signaling Pairs</b> menu in the Signal Mast
          Logic Table. This will generate Signal Mast Logic based
          upon all the Signal Masts on the Layout Editor panel. If
          not yet active, it will give you the option to activate
          Layout Block Routing.<br>
          Please be aware that on large layouts with a large number
          of signal masts configured, this can take some time.</li>

          <li>It is even easier if you use hardware like <a href=
          "http://www.rr-cirkits.com">RR-Circuits Signalman</a>, and
          the easiest using pre-configured <a href=
          "http://signalist.co.uk">Signalist SC1</a> that support
          the NMRA signal aspect commands. You can skip the Signal
          Head and Layout Editor steps and go right to creating the
          Signal Mast as a single entry and the hardware handles
          all of the LED/lamp lighting, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You manually add new Signal Mast Logic pairs by clicking
        either
        <ul>
          <li>the
          "Add..." button at the bottom of the Signal Mast Logic
          table or</li>
          <li>the "Add Logic" button at the bottom of the Signal
          Mast Logic Pairs pane.</li>
        </ul>
        Both will take you to the
        <a href=
                   "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/AddEditSignalingLogic.shtml">
          "Add Edit Signal Mast Logic" pane</a>.


        <h3>Changing Signal Mast Logic</h3>
        <!-- JMRI groups message -->
        Configuration of an existing Signal Mast Logic can be accessed
        from three different locations:

        <ul>
          <li>In the <a href=
          "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastLogicTable.shtml">
          Signal Mast Logic Table</a> there is an Edit button for
          each Signal Mast Logic pair.</li>

          <li>In the <a href=
          "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.shtml">
          Signal Mast Table</a>, there is an "Edit Logic" button for
          each Signal Mast, which opens a pane from which you can
          select one of the Signalling Pairs set for this source Signal
          Mast.</li>

          <li>In the pop-up menu that appears when you
          right-click on a Signal Mast Icon on a Layout Editor
          Panel, using the Signal Mast Logic menu item.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Logic to Un-Signaled Areas or Buffer Stops</h2>
        <p>The Signal Mast Logic works only between a source and
          destination Signal Mast, so if you have a valid route to an
          End Bumper/Buffer Stop/Dark Area, then there is no specific
          destination Signal Mast. In this situation you would create
          a "dummy" Signal Mast of type Virtual in de Signal Mast
          Table to act as your destination Signal Mast. It doesn't
          have to represent a signal on the layout or have Signal
          Heads associated. All that this Virtual Signal Mast has to
          do is display a "Danger" aspect.</p>
