      <h1>Entry Exit and Interlocking</h1>
      <span class="since">since 2.99.4</span>
      <p>This brief tutorial is
      designed to explain how the Entry Exit and Interlocking is
      set up and works within JMRI. It is based upon the Signal
      Mast Logic <a href=
      "http://www.jmri.org/community/clinics/UK2011/">clinic</a>
      held in the UK and follows on from that.</p>

      <p>The panel file for this tutorial was taken from the "Logix
      and Feathers" section of the Signal Mast tutorial. The only
      difference is that the Signal Mast Logic has been removed
      from all the Signal Masts apart from the "up outer mast" and
      the "down platform mast" as these are used to represent
      signals in automatically controlled areas.</p>

      <p>In addition the file has been modified to use Internal
      Sensors and Turnouts only, thus allowing it to be opened with
      any system connection configured in the JMRI Preferences.</p>

      <p>As a prerequisite the <a href=
      "http://www.jmri.org/community/clinics/UK2011/">clinic</a> on
      Signal Mast Logic should be followed before attempting this
      one as it provides the foundation on how to build your panel
      ready for use with the Signal Mast Logic and also
      Interlocking.</p>

      <p>The track plan for this is the same as in the Signal Mast
      Logic clinic and could be considered a typical scenario where
      the Down Approach, Up Platform and Bay Signals would be under
      the control of the SignalMan, while the Up Outer and Down
      Platform would be automatically controlled.</p>

      <p>The panel file for this tutorial can be found <a href=
      "Interlock%20Demo%201.xml">here</a></p>

      <p>The NX buttons all work in pairs and must be selected in
      the correct order. Also it is not possible to leap-frog an NX
      button to set a Route between two non-adjacent buttons. I.e.
      if you have buttons A-B-C it is not possible to set a route
      from A to C, the order of selection must be A-B B-C.</p>

      <h2>Setting up the layout editor</h2>

      <p>In the Signal Mast Logic tutorial, each block was
      configured with a different color to show Occupied and
      Unoccupied states (<a href=
      "http://www.jmri.org/community/clinics/UK2011/layout_editor.shtml">Building
      a Layout</a>). In addition it is possible to assign an
      alternative color to each Block on the panel. When using Full
      Interlocking, this alternative color is used to highlight
      routes that have been set. When a Block is using the
      alternative color it also prevents another route from being
      set using that Block.</p>

      <p>The eNtry eXit (NX) utilises Sensors for each NX location,
      typically associated with a signal or an End Bumper/Buffer
      Stop. These Sensors would act in the same way as a button on
      a physical panel, setting the button active to start the
      selection with the setting Active of a second Sensor
      completing the route or path selection. If a matching Sensor
      is not activated within 10 seconds then the initial Sensor
      will be reset back to Inactive.</p>

      <p>A sensor needs to be configured for each NX location. As a
      suggestion to help keep track of things, prefix the User Name
      with "NX" followed by the associated signal. So for example
      if the NX Sensor will be associated with the "Down Appr"
      signal, then make the Sensor User Name "NX Down Appr".</p>

      <p>Once the Sensors have been created they can be associated and
      positioned with locations on the Layout Editor Panel, in the same
      way that the Signal Masts were done in part 6 of the Signal
      Mast Logic clinic. Bring up the context menu (right click) on
      the Block boundary and select "Set Sensors" from the
      list.</p>

      <p><img src="images/assignsensors.png" width="331" height=
      "539"></p>

      <p>Remember that the Block which the Sensor is assigned to
      will determine the direction of travel; if the Sensor is
      assigned to the incorrect Block then it will not get picked
      up and the interlocks will not work.<br>
      The panel file with the Sensors already assigned can be found
      <a href="Interlock%20Demo%202.xml">here</a></p>

      <h2>Creating the NX Rules</h2>
      <p>Open up the Entry Exit window, which can be found in the
      Tools menu of the Layout Editor.
      This will bring up a window like the following:</p>

      <p><img src="images/emptyentryexitwindow.png" width="790"
      height="244"></p>

      <p>This window allows you to see which NX pairs have been
      created and the state of each pair. From this window we can
      get the system to automatically generate the pairs or we can
      manually define them.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select the Layout Editor panel file that you wish to
        create the NX on.</li>

        <li>If you are going to create the pair manually,
        select the Entry and Exit Points from the respective drop
        down lists, or leave them as is.</li>

        <li>Select the type of interlocking that we are going to
        use.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Set Turnout Only</b> - This will only set the
            turnouts to the correct state between the NX
            sensors.</li>

            <li><b>Set Turnouts and Signal Masts</b> - This will do
            as above, but also generate the Signal Mast Logic at
            the same time.</li>

            <li><b>Full Interlock</b> - This will do all of the
            above and also lock the path and prevent another
            clashing one from being selected.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Set Turnout Only</h2>
      <p>If to start with you select "Set
      Turnout Only" and press "Auto generate Entry Exit Pairs", it
      will end up generating a list with four pairs like in the
      following illustration:</p>

      <p><img src="images/populatedentryexitwindow.png" width="790"
      height="315"></p>

      <p>The four paths generated are all valid NX pairs based upon
      the direction of travel. For the NX to be set you must first
      select the Entry sensor, followed by the Exit sensor. If they
      are selected in the reverse order the path will not be
      set.</p>

      <p>You can see that if you were to set a Route from the "down
      appr" to the bay buffer stop, the Turnouts get automatically
      set. The Sensors will also flash while the Route is being set
      up:</p>

      <p><img src="images/interlockturnout.png" width="498" height=
      "229"></p>

      <p>If you then set a Route from the "Bay Mast" to the "Up
      Appr", again the Turnouts will automatically be set:</p>

      <p><img src="images/interlockturnout2.png" width="498" height=
      "229"></p>

      <p>With the <b>Turnout Only</b> interlock type, as no further
      logic or interlocking is done, it is possible to allow the
      interlock to be set up no matter which way round the NX
      buttons are selected. This can be done by selecting the "Both
      Way" flag in the table against an entry. You can then set the
      path in reverse, eg "NX Up Outer" to "NX Bay Mast".</p>

      <p>In addition to this, with a "Turnout Only" set you can
      also create NX pairs that go against the normal direction of
      travel, for example from "Bay Mast" to "Down Appr"</p>

      <h2>Turnouts and Signal Masts</h2>
      <p>If "Set Turnouts and Signal
      Masts" is selected and then the "Auto Generate" button is
      pressed, the same four interlocks will be generate, with the
      NX type set to "Signal Mast".</p>

      <p>This time when you set the Route between two NX sensors,
      it will set the Turnouts and if Signal Masts are placed at
      the same location it also configures the logic from the
      Signal Mast at the source.</p>

      <p><img src="images/interlocksigmast.png" width="498" height=
      "229"></p>

      <p>The Signal Mast Logic will appear in the Signal Mast Logic
      Table. This logic is not saved when the panel file is
      saved.</p>

      <p>If you set a Route from "Down Appr" into the bay buffer
      stop, you will see that the Turnouts get set and the Signal
      changes to the correct Aspect. If you then change the state of
      the Turnout or Block on the path, you will see that the
      source Signal Mast will change Aspect appropriately.</p>

      <h2>Full Interlock</h2>

      <p>If "Full Interlock" is selected and then the "Auto
      Generate" button is pressed, again you would end up with the
      four interlocks as before.</p>

      <h3>With Signalmasts</h3>
      <p>When a full interlock is configured
      and there are Signal Masts placed at the NX locations, Interlocking
      will place the Signal Mast at the source location into a Held
      state until a path has been set, which will in turn release
      the signal. This is working on the basis that these signals
      are now under the control of a SignalMan who has to set the
      appropriate Route before releasing the signal.</p>

      <p><img src="images/interlockmasttable.png" width="650"
      height="347"></p>

      <p>The full interlock will also set the state of the layout Blocks
      to use the alternative color, and the NX sensor buttons will
      remain in a solid active state.</p>

      <p><img src="images/interlockfull.png" width="498" height=
      "229"></p>

      <p>If you try and set a conflicting path, then an error
      message will be displayed and the path will not be set.</p>

      <p>As the Route gets cleared down by a train occupying the
      Blocks, so does the interlock.</p>

      <p><img src="images/interlockfull2.png" width="498" height=
      "229"></p>

      <p>If you re-select an active interlock, the NX sensors will
      start to flash, and you get the option to either "Cancel" the
      route, "Clear Down" or "Exit".</p>

      <p><img src="images/interlockcancelclear.png" width="318"
      height="116"></p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Cancel" will de-activate the Route</li>

        <li>"Clear Down" will manually simulate a train traveling
        over the blocks and move any values assigned against the
        block to the end block.</li>

        <li>"Exit" will just put this message on the screen and do
        nothing else.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Without Signal Masts</h3>
      <p>If no Signal Masts are
      configured between the two points the interlock will work in
      very much the same way as it would with Signal Masts, it just
      doesn't set up or release any signals.</p>

      <h2>Further Details</h2>

      <p>With all the Entry Exit methods the system will try to set
      the route with the lowest cost. Each layout Block has a cost
      assigned. It is the sum of all the block costs in a route that
      determine the overall route cost. By default, a Main Track is
      assigned a value of 50, while a side track has a value of
      200. These values can be changed by the user, by editing the
      layout Block. If the route with the lowest cost has either
      another entry/exit point in the same direction, or a Block
      that is already set Occupied or Reserved, then it will try
      and find an alternative route if one is available.</p>

      <p><img src="images/editblock.png" width="368" height=
      "579"></p>

      <p>Uni-directional Blocks - It is possible to set the
      relationship between adjacent Blocks, to prevent routes from
      being set up from one block to another or vice-versa. This is
      set when editing the layout Block; you have the option for
      Both Way, to Only Send or Only Receive.</p>

      <p>To view how a particular Block connects to other Blocks,
      with costs and valid Paths, right click on a track segment or
      turnout circle and select "View Block Routing".</p>
