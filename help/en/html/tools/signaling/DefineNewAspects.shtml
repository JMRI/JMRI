      <h1>JMRI: Defining Your Own Signaling System</h1>This page
      describes how to define a new signaling system to JMRI.

      <p>We go through creating one from scratch, but it's often
      easier to copy and modify one of the existing ones in the
      <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/">xml/signals</a>
      directory.</p>

      <h2>Creating a New Signaling System</h2>First, you need to
      manually create a new directory in the JMRI system file
      directory under the "xml/signals" or in the user preferences
      directory "resources/signals" which will hold your new signal
      definition. By convention, the name of this directory (e.g.
      "basic" or "AAR-1946") provides the system name for your
      signal definition. Any Signal Masts you create that use your
      new signal system definition will include the signaling
      system's system name in their own (mast's) system name, so
      it's inconvenient to change the system name of the signal
      system. Think ahead a little bit: Will there be variants of
      this definition for different eras or different divisions? If
      so, include a year or location in the name, to make it easier
      to create modified versions.<br>
      Note: do not use any special characters like ampersands
      (&amp;) or spaces in names for files and directories. JMRI
      runs on lots of computers, and filenames with spaces or
      special characters can cause problems for other people if you
      ever contribute your files back to JMRI for distribution.

      <p>Then, provide these files:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>index.shtml - Free-form description of the signal
        system</li>

        <li>aspects.xml - Define the complete set of available
        aspects</li>

        <li>appearance-*.xml - One file for each type of
        SignalMast, defining how to display each aspect. Take a
        look at some existing signal systems to see typical naming
        conventions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Create a new index.shtml file</h3>This file provides only
      a description, but it's important to do it first so that you
      record the details of what you've done.

      <p>If you're capturing a prototypical system, record what you
      know about it: The railroad, region/district, year, where you
      found the information, etc.</p>

      <p>If you're making up your own system, describe it in some
      detail so that you can come back to it later on and remember
      what you had in mind.</p>

      <h3>Create a new aspects.xml file</h3>The
      <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> element at the top of this file
      provides the user name for your signaling system, which
      features prominently in the user interface. It can be a
      little more verbose than the directory name, but should be
      similar enough so that the user can associate them if needed.

      <p>The <code>&lt;aspects&gt;</code> element in this file
      lists <em>all</em> the aspects that can appear in this
      signaling system (most model railroads only model one
      railroad, so there's only one system present, but it is
      possible to use more than one). You can come back and add
      more later if needed, but it's better to enter them all at
      the beginning because the names will be more consistent,
      etc.</p>

      <p>Most of the file is blocks that look like this:</p>
      <pre>
  &lt;aspect&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;indication&gt;&lt;/indication&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;reference&gt;&lt;/reference&gt;
    &lt;comment&gt;&lt;/comment&gt;
    &lt;imagelink&gt;&lt;/imagelink&gt;
    &lt;speed&gt;&lt;/speed&gt;
    &lt;speed2&gt;&lt;/speed2&gt;
    &lt;route&gt;&lt;/route&gt;
    &lt;dccAspect&gt;&lt;/dccAspect&gt;
  &lt;/aspect&gt;
</pre>You have to fill in the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> element.
The others are optional, but the order of all elements is mandatory
to successfully pass the XML validation. The
<code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;indication&gt;</code>
elements may only be included once. The
<code>&lt;description&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;reference&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;comment&gt;</code> elements can be included as many
times as you'd like.

      <p>The <code>&lt;imagelink&gt;</code> element, if present,
      should point to an image file (.gif, .png or .jpg) showing
      what the family of Appearances looks like. If you provide
      individual images in the <a href="#appearances">appearance
      files</a>, they'll also be displayed here. Individual images
      is a better solution, but it's also more work.</p>

      <p>The <code>&lt;speed&gt;</code> element, if present, should
      either be a numerical value or a string value that has been
      defined in the signalSpeeds.xml file. The
      <code>&lt;speed&gt;</code> element relates to the maximum
      speed a train can pass the mast displaying this Aspect at.
      The Signal Mast Logic uses this speed to help determine which
      aspect should be displayed where there are multiple possible
      aspects.<br>
      An optional <code>&lt;speed2&gt;</code> element contains the
      speed (value) the train should - or may - reach upon arriving
      at the next signal. For a Clear aspect it would be identical
      to <code>&lt;speed&gt;</code>, but in the Approach Diverging
      aspect it will typically be less.<br>
      Both of the speed entries refer to the protected block as it
      was when the train first arrived at the signal, because of
      course it will have changed to 'stop' once the train has
      entered the next block (more on speeds <a href=
      "https://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/mailman/jmri-developers/?viewmonth=201106&amp;viewday=22">
      in the JMRI Developers list</a>).</p>

      <p>The <code>&lt;route&gt;</code> element, if present, should
      simply be entered as 'Diverging', 'Normal' or 'Either'. If
      the element is omitted or left blank then it is taken as
      being 'Normal'. The <code>&lt;route&gt;</code> element
      indicates that this specific Aspect is used when a turnout
      has been thrown in the path ahead. The Signal Mast Logic
      logic uses this element to help determine which aspect should
      be displayed where there are multiple possible Aspects.</p>

      <p>The <code>&lt;dccAspect&gt;</code> element, if present, is
      the default DCC signal accessory decoder ID for that aspect.
      These values are then used to populate the aspect IDs when a
      DCC or LNCP signal driver is used. The values can be
      over-written by the user when creating or editing a
      particular Signal Mast.</p>

      <p>The <code>&lt;delay&gt;</code> element, if present, allows
      a delay to be configured between changing the aspects on each
      signal head where multiple heads are configured on a
      mast.<br>
      This is ideally used where in the prototype a manually
      operated signal (eg. semaphore) would have to be set by the
      signalman, therefore only one signal head (or Arm) would be
      set at any one time.</p>

      <p>Below the <code>&lt;aspect&gt;</code> blocks, there's a
      block that names all the valid appearance files, e.g.:</p>
      <pre>
  &lt;appearancefiles&gt;
    &lt;appearancefile href="appearance-SL-1-high-abs.xml"/&gt;
    &lt;appearancefile href="appearance-SL-1-high-pbs.xml"/&gt;
    &lt;appearancefile href="appearance-SL-1-low.xml"/&gt;
  &lt;/appearancefiles&gt;
</pre>Create this part as you create the appearance files (see next
section), so the program can locate all of them and display them to
the user. <a name="appearances" id="appearances"></a>

      <h3>Create appearance-*.xml files</h3>For each kind of signal
      on the layout (single head searchlight, double searchlight,
      dwarf, semaphore, etc.) you need to create a dedicated
      appearance file.

      <p>Take a look at some existing signal systems to see typical
      naming conventions. Note: do not use any special characters
      like ampersands (&amp;) or spaces in names for files and
      directories. JMRI runs on lots of computers, and filenames
      with spaces or special characters can cause problems for
      other people if you ever contribute your files back to JMRI
      for distribution.</p>

      <p>The top of the file is some boiler-plate that you can copy
      from an existing system, then modify with your own author and
      revision history information.</p>

      <p>The value of the <code>&lt;aspecttable&gt;</code> element
      should be the user name for the overall system, as defined in
      the aspects.xml file's <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> element.</p>

      <p>The <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> element is the user name for
      this particular type of signal mast. If should be pretty
      descriptive of the mast, and related in some obvious way to
      the filename. Use the <code>&lt;reference&gt;</code> and
      <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> elements to provide
      information to future users of this signal system. You can
      see how this is displayed in a <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/xml/signals/AAR-1946/appearance-SL-1-high-pbs.xml">
      sample file</a>.</p>

      <p>Next is the <code>&lt;appearances&gt;</code> element,
      which contains a series of <code>&lt;appearance&gt;</code>
      elements that define how the individual Aspects appear on
      this type of signal mast. Not every Aspect needs to be
      defined in every file, as not every type of signal mast can
      show every Aspect.</p>

      <p>Each Aspect that the signal can show needs to be described
      with a block like this:</p>
      <pre>
  &lt;appearance&gt;
    &lt;aspectname&gt;Clear&lt;/aspectname&gt;
    &lt;show&gt;green&lt;/show&gt;
    &lt;show&gt;red&lt;/show&gt;
    &lt;reference&gt;&lt;/reference&gt;
    &lt;delay&gt;&lt;/delay&gt;
    &lt;imagelink&gt;&lt;/imagelink&gt;
  &lt;/appearance&gt;
</pre>The <code>&lt;aspectname&gt;</code> needs to be at the start,
followed by zero or more <code>&lt;show&gt;</code> elements.

      <p>The show element(s) will be used to set the Signal Heads
      that make up the signal properly to display this Aspect.
      There can be zero or more of these, containing "red",
      "flashred", "yellow", "flashyellow", "green", "flashgreen",
      "lunar", "flashlunar" or "dark".</p>

      <p>You can have as many <code>&lt;reference&gt;</code>
      elements as you'd like, they're for user-readable
      documentation.</p>

      <p>The imagelink element, if present, should point to an
      image file (of type .gif, .png or .jpg) showing what this
      Appearance looks like.<br>
      If you are creating or using custom images then these should
      be placed in a sub-directory within the user preference area,
      and the image link should then be prefixed with "preference:"
      followed by the remainder of the path. As long as you work
      locally, use preference:resources/etc paths. If all aspects
      of your new signal definition are working on your
      panel/layout and you plan to submit your new signal system as
      a patch to JMRI, use full URL paths like
      http://jmri.org/resources/icons/etc in the XML files so that
      they'll work with both the local JMRI program and for people
      viewing them on the JMRI web site.</p>

      <h4>Specific Appearances</h4>There are four specific
      appearances that JMRI will and can refer to, as the
      appearance names are all user defined and can be in any
      language all are optional and dependent upon the Signal
      Mast:<br>
      <b>danger</b> This is the most restrictive aspect that the
      signal mast can show. When the path ahead is not set or clear
      the signal mast logic will set the signal mast to this
      appearance.<br>
      <b>permissive</b> (Call-On) this appearance is displayed if
      the block ahead is occupied, but another train is allowed to
      enter it.<br>
      <b>held</b> provides (via the imagelink element) an
      alternative panel image to indicate that the "held" condition
      on the signal has been set. Higher-level logic can
      (optionally) use the aspect element to determine what to set
      the signal to when held has been set.<br>
      <b>dark</b> is used to provide an alternative image on the
      panel to indicate that the signal is not lit.<br>
      Each specific aspect can be given an alternative image to use
      other than that given in the main appearance definition.<br>
      This information can be entered after the appearance
      information in the following form:
      <pre>
  &lt;specificappearances&gt;
    &lt;danger&gt;
      &lt;aspect&gt;Danger&lt;/aspect&gt;
    &lt;/danger&gt;
    &lt;permissive&gt;
      &lt;aspect&gt;Off&lt;/aspect&gt;
    &lt;/permissive&gt;
    &lt;held&gt;
      &lt;aspect&gt;Danger&lt;/aspect&gt;
      &lt;imagelink&gt;held.gif&lt;/imagelink&lt;
    &lt;/held&gt;
    &lt;dark&gt;
      &lt;aspect&gt;Not Lit&lt;/aspect&gt;
      &lt;imagelink&gt;notlit.gif&lt;/imagelink&lt;
    &lt;/dark&gt;
  &lt;/specificappearances&gt;
</pre>Only one aspect can be defined for each specific appearance.
For each specific appearance entered, the corresponding <code>
      &lt;aspect&gt;</code> entry must be a valid
      <code>&lt;aspectname&gt;</code> that occurs in the appearance
      definitions for the mast.

      <h4>Aspect Mapping</h4>The Aspect Mapping is used to help
      determine the progression of signaling Aspects. The purpose
      of the map is to define which potential Aspects are valid
      depending upon what Aspect is being displayed on the signal
      mast that is ahead of us. This mapping can be a simple
      one-to-one, E.g. Advanced signal mast is showing Approach, we
      should show Clear. Or a more complex one-to-many map where
      there could be multiple Aspects that we could display, E.g.
      Advanced signal is showing Stop, but we could display either
      a Approach or Diverging Approach depending upon other
      conditions.

      <p>The value of the <code>&lt;advancedAspect&gt;</code> can
      be any that is defined in the Aspect table of our signaling
      system's aspects.xml file.<br>
      The value of <code>&lt;ourAspect&gt;</code> must be one that
      is defined and supported by this appearance file (so it can
      be displayed on this signal mast type).</p>

      <p>All of the mappings are contained within the
      <code>&lt;aspectMappings&gt;</code> tags, each in their own
      <code>&lt;aspectMapping&gt;</code> tag e.g.</p>
      <pre>
  &lt;aspectMappings&gt;
    &lt;aspectMapping&gt;
      &lt;advancedAspect&gt;Approach&lt;/advancedAspect&gt;
      &lt;ourAspect&gt;Clear&lt;/ourAspect&gt;
    &lt;/aspectMapping&gt;
    &lt;aspectMapping&gt;
      &lt;advancedAspect&gt;Stop&lt;/advancedAspect&gt;
      &lt;ourAspect&gt;Approach&lt;/ourAspect&gt;
      &lt;ourAspect&gt;Diverging Approach&lt;/ourAspect&gt;
    &lt;/aspectMapping&gt;
  &lt;/aspectMappings&gt;
</pre>

      <h3>Check Your Work</h3>

      <p>You can use the "Validate XML File" tools under the JMRI
      "Debug" window to check your files. (Note that you have to be
      connected to the internet to do this, as the files refer to
      some checking resources that live on the JMRI web site.)
      First, it checks the basic format: Are all the &lt; and &gt;
      characters in the right place? Etc. Then it makes sure that
      the right elements are in the right places, checks some of
      the contents, etc.</p>

      <h3>Amendments to an existing Signaling System</h3>There are
      a number of signaling definitions already provided within
      JMRI which are located in the "xml/signals" directory, some
      of these may generally meet your existing requirements
      however some might require changes to suit the hardware that
      you use, or there are local variation in operations, or
      simply that you do not have the facility to work to a fully
      prototypical set of signals.

      <p>In this case it is possible to amend and create your own
      appearance files that will over-ride the JMRI provided ones.
      You will need to first create a sub-directory in the resource
      directory located in the user preference area called
      "signals", you will then need to create a sub-directory in
      there which has exactly the same name as the JMRI provided
      one. From there any appearance files you create or copy into
      will either be added to the mast list for that signaling
      system or overwrite the predefined JMRI Signal Mast.</p>

      <p>The advantage of placing new and amended signal mast
      Appearance files here is that when JMRI is updated, then
      these files will not get overwritten and lost!</p>
