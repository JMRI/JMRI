      <h1>JMRI: Signaling</h1>

      <p>This page introduces Signaling, lists the JMRI Signaling
      Tools and points to more advanced methods.</p>

      <p>Modeling railroad signaling on a layout can be done in
      many different ways, ranging from simple "stoplights" to a
      complete emulation of a particular prototype's signaling
      rules. JMRI provides a combination of tools to implement
      Signaling. JMRI supports <a href=
      "AspectSignaling.shtml">prototypical signaling</a> based on
      signal <a href="#aspect">Aspects</a> and <a href=
      "#appearance">Appearances</a> along with CTC dispatching and
      interlocking, without requiring the user to write any script
      or Java code.</p>

      <h2>Signaling Vocabulary</h2>

      <h3>Prototype Railroad Signaling terms:</h3><a href=
      "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CSX_River_Sub_Kingston_CP_90.jpg"><img src="images/132px-CSX_River_Sub_Kingston_CP_90.jpg"
      width="132" height="240" align="right"></a> 
      <!-- With some very useful information from the JMRI developers structure site -->

      <ul>
        <li><a name="head" id="head"><b>Signal Head</b></a> or
        <b>Signal Arm</b> Each individual signal unit on a lit or
        semaphore Signal Mast. It shows exactly one Appearance,
        generally a color (though not always, e.g.
        semaphores).</li>

        <li><b>Light</b> The individual lamp in a signal. A light
        may indicate multiple <a href="#aspect">Aspects</a> if it
        changes color like in a Searchlight signal, or it may take
        multiple lights to indicate a single <a href=
        "#aspect">Aspect</a>, for example in Position Light
        Signals.</li>

        <li><b>Marker</b> A Signal Head or Arm that does not change
        color or position.</li>

        <li><b>Signal</b> The object that conveys an Indication via
        a specific pattern of its visible parts. It can be as
        simple as a sign, saying "start CTC"; that conveys a
        particular indication and invokes a rule. Usually we're
        referring to lit or movable Signals, though, which can show
        more than one Indication. The Signal might have one light
        and use different colors to convey different Indications,
        or it needs more than one set of lights to display a wider
        range of Aspects to fit the location.</li>

        <li><b>Signal Mast</b> The pole that mounts one or more
        Signal Heads or Arms and (usually) controls one individual
        track. Also used to refer to an entire signal made up of
        one or more Signal Heads. Dwarf Signals are also considered
        Signal Masts.</li>

        <li><a name="appearance" id=
        "appearance"><b>Appearance</b></a> One of a series of
        allowed options for a <a href="#head">Signal Head</a> or
        Signal Arm, e.g. Red, Green, Raised.</li>

        <li><a name="aspect" id="aspect"><b>Aspect</b></a> One of a
        series of allowed options for the visual pattern of a
        Signal Mast using one or more Signal Heads or Arms to
        convey a speed or route <a href=
        "#indication">Indication</a>. Different Signal Mast types
        can use different Aspects for a specific Indication, but a
        particular Signal Mast type always conveys a particular
        Indication via just one Aspect. For example, to convey "You
        can run at full speed" - an Indication (Rule 281, "Clear")
        - one signal might display a single green light, another
        might show a green over red, and a third might have an
        upward semaphore. Those are all different Aspects showing
        the same Indication. As all these different Aspects are
        assigned the same descriptive name, e.g. "Approach", when
        you think of these Aspects as "Approach on a triple
        searchlight signal" and "Approach on a single semaphore"
        and the difference is evident.</li>

        <li><a name="indication" id=
        "indication"><b>Indication</b></a> On (most) western US
        railroads, "Indication" refers to the message that a Signal
        is sending. It generally has a name, like "Clear" or
        "Approach", but officially it's a railroad Rule (like 281
        or 285) that the train must obey when governed by that
        Signal. So Indication is the <em>meaning</em> a signal
        conveys to the engineer, say the full instruction for a
        signal Aspect, e.g. "Proceed preparing to stop at next
        signal. Train exceeding medium speed must at once reduce to
        that speed." (for the "Approach" Aspect according to the
        AAR 1946 Rule Book).</li>

        <li><b>Distant Signal</b> The signal you are controlling is
        called a Distant Signal if it is programmed to show the
        same or a more restrictive Aspect as the next signal in the
        direction and route of travel.</li>

        <li><b>Dark Territory</b> Section of running track not
        controlled by signals. <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_territory">Dark
        Territory</a> is governed by other methods like Timetable
        and Train Order (TT &amp; TO) Operation, Direct Traffic
        Control or Track Warrants.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Different railroads have different Rules to operate rail
      traffic, using different terms. In their respective Rule
      Books, they use different Aspects for rules of the same name.
      And some will have different Appearances to make up those
      Aspects (e.g. semaphore vs. single lamps vs. color-position
      signals vs. position light signals vs. cab signals vs
      ...)<br>
      Picture on the right: a CSX Searchlight Signal Mast with 2
      Signal Heads, showing a "red over red" Aspect, meaning the
      "Stop" Indication.</p>

      <h3>JMRI specific Signaling terms:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Virtual</b> Virtual signals are JMRI internal
        signals with no actual hardware attached. Virtual Signals
        may represent theoretical Aspects at buffer stops or in
        staging that are used by prior signals.</li>

        <li><b>Protected Sensor</b> The next block occupancy
        sensor(s) following the signal you are controlling in the
        direction and route of travel. The "protection" is to
        prevent a train from entering an occupied block without
        warning.</li>

        <li><b>Protected Signal</b> The next signal after the one
        you are controlling in the direction and route of travel.
        The "protection" is to prevent a train from approaching a
        stop signal without sufficient warning to allow it to be
        stopped short of reaching the "protected" signal.</li>

        <li><b>Signaling System</b> A set of icons, definition
        files and rules following either a prototype Rule Book or a
        simplified set of rules (see <a href=
        "AspectSignaling.shtml#systems">this list</a>).</li>

        <li><b>System Name</b> The name of a JMRI object
        identifying either a virtual (Internal) or physical piece
        of hardware being used, e.g. an output on a decoder to
        control a signal. The System Name must follow certain
        <a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Naming Rules</a>
        to be correctly interpreted bij JMRI, and the name will
        vary depending on your hardware so it must match your DCC
        system.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="signaling" id="signaling">Prototype Railroad
      Signaling</a></h2>

      <p>Across the world railroads have developed a wide range of
      signaling hardware such as Flags (not supported in JMRI),
      Semaphores, Position Light Signals and Color Light Signals.
      Different physical signals may show the same "Indication"
      using different combinations of lights, semaphore positions,
      and/or placards; these patterns of lights are called
      "Aspects". For example, the "Stop" Aspect will be a single
      red light on a signal mast with only one lamp, red over red
      lamps for a signal mast with two lamps, etc. To learn the
      rules of the railroad you model is part of the hobby but JMRI
      helps by providing more than 20 prototypical signaling
      systems from different countries to choose from. Still, it's
      up to the engineer to interpret the Signal Aspects displayed
      and adjust the throttle...</p>

      <p>Much of basic <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_block_signaling#Automatic_traffic_control">
      Automatic Block Signaling</a> (ABS) can be boiled down to "a
      Signal goes Red when a train can't safely enter the block it
      protects; it goes Yellow when the block following the
      protected block can't be entered". Although that's a
      simplification, it can serve as a good starting point for
      understanding signaling logic. More modern signaling systems
      are <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_block_signaling#Automatic_traffic_control">
      Absolute Permissive Block</a> (APB) signaling used by many
      western US railroads and <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralized_traffic_control">Centralized
      Traffic Control</a> (CTC) remotely operated from large
      switchboards.</p>

      <h3>Standard CTC nomenclature</h3>

      <h4>Union Switch &amp; Signal Company (US&amp;S)</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Signals are identified by EVEN numbers with movement
        direction as depicted on the panel (R - right, L -
        left)</li>

        <li>Switches are identified as ODD numbers</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example #1: Signals at a controlled switch with single
      track approaching from the left to two tracks moving to right
      - 2R (facing point), 2L (main route), 2LA (diverging route).
      2LA would be shown as 2L on the panel to correspond with
      Signal Lever 2. Cardinal directions might also be used (N, S,
      E, W) at a diamond for the opposing route. Switches are N
      (normal) or R (reverse).<br>
      Example #2: Dennis Drury's CTC signals get even numbers with
      a directional modifier such as E 50 W or E 52 W. The
      intermediate block signals may be numbered based on milepost
      locations such as 322.2 and 322.3.</p>

      <h4>General Railroad Signal (GRS)</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Signals get ODD numbers</li>

        <li>Switches get EVEN numbers (as opposed to
        US&amp;S!)</li>

        <li>Same R - right, L - left scheme, though</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Thanks to Jim Duncan, who adds: There are always
      exceptions! Any labeling must be consistent, easy to
      understand, and have absolutely no possibility of being
      confused with any other signal, switch or lever.</p>

      <h2>JMRI Signaling Tools</h2>

      <p>It is really straight forward to use Aspect Signaling,
      especially if suitable signal hardware is already configured
      in JMRI or you want to use Signal Masts with more than one
      Signal Head. Aspect Signaling in JMRI uses of a series of
      Aspect definition files that come with JMRI since version
      2.9. In addition to tapping into one of the more than 20
      prototypical <a href=
      "AspectSignaling.shtml#systems">Signaling Systems</a> that
      come with JMRI, you can tweak one to suit your hardware and
      operations or define your own and share it as part of a next
      version of JMRI.<br>
      JMRI provides the following core Signaling Tools, available
      from the <b>Tools &gt; Tables &gt; Signals &gt;</b> menu:</p>

      <p>1. <b><a href="SignalHeads.shtml">Signal Head</a></b>
      objects represent the individual lights of a signal and can
      be created, changed, deleted and set to specific Appearances
      (colors) in the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalHeadTable.shtml">
      Signal Head Table</a>. One or more Signal Heads usually are
      part of a Signal Mast. For signaling decoders that directly
      support multiple Aspects, it may not be necessary to create
      individual Signal Heads before creating Signal Mast
      objects.</p>

      <p>2. <b><a href="SignalMasts.shtml">Signal Mast</a></b>
      objects represent an entire signal with one or more Signal
      Heads. Using Signal Mast objects allows you to display
      prototypical Aspects on signals. You specify what kind of
      <a href="AspectSignaling.shtml#systems">Signaling System</a>
      is to be used, the specific Signal Mast type e.g. "double
      searchlight" or "single head dwarf" and which Signal Heads or
      aspect aware signal hardware this Signal Mast is going to
      drive. When the <a href="#aspect">Aspect</a> of a Signal Mast
      is set to e.g. "Approach medium", JMRI handles the layout
      communication needed to make the signal on the layout display
      the right colors.<br>
      <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalMasts-num.png"><img src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalMasts-num.png"
      width="309" height="83" align="right"></a> Signal Masts are
      configured through the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.shtml">
      Signal Mast Table</a>. From the Signal Mast Table, you can
      create and edit Signal Masts and set individual Signal Masts
      to any Aspect that they're able to display by clicking in the
      "Aspect" column.<br>
      You can add a Signal Mast icon in the Panel Editor in the
      usual way. The Signal Mast icon will display the images from
      the Appearance definition for that particular Signal Mast
      type and Signal System.</p>

      <p>3. <b><a href="SignalGroups.shtml">Signal Groups</a></b>
      are used to define a number of Signal Heads, where only one
      Signal Head can be illuminated at any given time, depending
      upon the Appearance (Status) of the associated Signal Mast
      and a set of conditions.<br>
      Signal Groups would be used where additional indicators are
      installed to support the main Signal Mast, such as Junction,
      Route or Speed displays. These indicators provide additional
      information to the driver (US: engineer) that is not given by
      the main Signal Mast. Such indicators are frequently seen in
      European and UK signalling.</p>

      <p>4. The <b><a href="SignalMastLogic.shtml">Signal Mast
      Logic</a></b> tool allows the Signaling Logic to be built up
      as pairs of conditionals between Signal Masts on the layout.
      Each Signal Mast Logic will use the states of Blocks,
      Turnouts, Sensors and other Signal Masts to determine what
      Aspect a particular Signal Mast should be displaying.<br>
      If the layout has been drawn up using the Layout Editor and
      Signal Masts have been placed on the panel using the various
      tools, then it is possible for all the Signal Mast Logic to
      be dynamically built, with little user intervention. For
      panels created with Control Panel Editor some of this
      information is to be entered manually.</p>

      <p>All the information in the Tables is saved with the
      configuration in an XML file, along with control panel setup,
      Logix, Routes, and similar stuff. For more information on
      creating and displaying panels, including how to show signals
      on your panels, please see the <a href=
      "../../apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels help page</a>.</p>

      <h3>Signaling with Logix</h3>

      <p>A JMRI <a href="../Logix.shtml">Logix</a> provides logic
      and control capabilities for JMRI objects, including Signal
      Heads and Masts. Logix can be used to configure custom
      signaling logic by filling out forms, without writing any
      code. A user defines "Conditional" logic and the "Actions"
      that take place depending on the state of the logic. The
      following sub-sections show how Logix can examine and control
      Signals.</p>

      <h4><a name="variable" id="variable">Signal State Variables
      in Logix</a></h4>

      <p>State variables related to Signal Heads and Masts
      currently available for use in Logix Conditionals are listed
      below, along with information on each. State variables must
      always evaluate to either True or False. The condition
      resulting in True is given for each. If the condition is not
      met, the state variable evaluates to False. When a Logix is
      active, the states of entities (Sensor, Turnout, Signal Mast,
      etc.) specified in state variables in its Conditionals are
      monitored. A calculation of all Conditionals in the Logix is
      triggered when any monitored state changes as noted below.
      <i>Note:</i> Not all Logix conditionals are listed
      here.</p><a href=

      width="423" height="92" align="right"></a>

      <p>Conditionals for Variable Type "Signal Head":</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Signal Head Appearance Equals</b>: Evaluates to True
        if the Appearance of the specified Signal Head equals the
        Appearance specified in the 'State' variable. Calculation
        is triggered when the Appearance of the Signal Head
        changes.</li>

        <li><b>Signal Head Lit</b>: Evaluates to True if the
        specified Signal Head is lit.</li>

        <li><b>Signal Head Held</b>: Evaluates to True if the

      </ul>

      <p>Conditionals for Variable Type "Signal Mast":</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Signal Mast Aspect Equals</b>: Evaluates to True if
        the Aspect of the specified Signal Mast equals the Aspect
        specified in the 'State' variable. Calculation is triggered
        when the Aspect of the Signal Mast changes.</li>

        <li><b>Signal Mast Lit</b>: Evaluates to True if the

      <p>Just like other objects in JMRI you can set and read
      Signal Heads, Signal Masts and Signal Mast Logic via Scripts.
      Instead of defining our own language to accomplish this,
      <a href="../scripting/index.shtml">JMRI Scripting</a> uses
      the "Python" language that's commonly used in web
      development.<br>
      Several methods from the jmri_default.py file can be used to
      work with signaling. Methods that may be used in a Python
      script to interact with Signal Masts include: getAspect(),
      getSignalSystem(), getValidAspects() and setAspect(Stop). See
      these <a href=
      "AspectSignaling.shtml#mastscripting">Examples</a>.<br>
      To script a Signal Head the 'getSignalHead' method can be
      used. Then, 'setAppearance' is a method of the returned
      SignalHead object. Example:</p>
      <pre>
signals.getSignalHead("IH1").setAppearance(YELLOW)
</pre>

      An example script for a JMRI "Siglet" in Python. It listens
      for changes to two Sensors and a Turnout, and then
      recalculates a Signal Head Appearance based on the
      values.</p>For more information see the <a href=

      <h3>Automation Classes</h3>JMRI provides classes to help you
      write Java code to control your layout. The most powerful of
      these are aimed at general automation and make it easy to
      code your own signal logic into the program; see the <a href=
      "../automation/viaJava.shtml">Automation page</a>. The
      <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/Siglet.html">"Siglet"
      class</a> and it's kin are meant to make it easy to write
      complex custom signal logic; a variant of these was used by
      Nick Kulp's for signaling automation on his <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/community/examples/Panels-Cornwall/CornwallRunning.html">
      Cornwall Railroad</a>.

      <p>Although Automation Classes require writing code instead
      of just filling out a GUI form, JMRI handles all of the
      details of reading status changes from the layout, writing
      desired aspect changes back to the layout, and even the
      details of "which outputs do I have to set to get signal
      Apple Siding East to show Yellow?". You can concentrate on
      just the signal logic in the code you write. <a name=
      "widgets" id="widgets"></a></p>

      <h3>Toolkit</h3>The entire <a href=
      "../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">JMRI toolkit</a> is
      available for use if you really want to develop new tools,
      controlling every detail. Programming with the JMRI Toolkit
      provides control of most DCC and C/MRI systems, with useful
      tools for manipulating turnouts, sensors, signals,
      locomotives, etc. as well as powerful tools for working on
      the user screen.

      <h2>Legacy tools</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>The JMRI <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/blockboss/BlockBossFrame.shtml">
        Simple Signal Logic</a> tool provided the first basic
        version of ABS and Interlocking signaling using single head
        Signal Masts. The Simple Signal Logic (SSL) Tool is still
        available in the Tools menu. However, to prevent logic
        conflicts and strange Signal Aspects, do not attempt to
        combine the use of the SSL Tool and the newer Signal Mast
        Logic tools for the same signals.</li>
