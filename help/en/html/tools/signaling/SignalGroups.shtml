      <h1>JMRI: Signal Groups</h1>

      <p>Signal Groups are used to define a number of Signal Heads,
      where only one Signal Head can be illuminated at any given
      time, depending upon the status of the associated Signal Mast
      and a set of conditions.</p>

      <h3>Application</h3>

      <p>Signal Groups would be used where additional Indicators
      (displays) are used to support the main Signal Mast, such
      as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#junction">Junction Indicators</a></li>

        <li><a href="#route">Route Indicators</a></li>

        <li><a href="#speed">Speed Indicators</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>These Indicators provide additional information to the
      driver that is not given by the main Signal Mast. Such
      indicators are frequently seen in Continental European and UK
      signaling.</p>

      <h4><a name="junction" id="junction">Junction
      Indicators</a></h4><img src=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalGroup1.png"
      align="right" width="30" height="90" hspace="0" vspace="0"
      alt="Junction Indicator figure">

      <p>A Junction Indicator can be configured to display anything
      from 1 to 6 diverging routes. A single indicator will
      frequently be found where a branch line diverges off from a
      main line. Multiple indicators will be found in more complex
      areas such as the approach to stations and good yards, where
      multiple routes can be taken. The Junction Indicator informs
      the driver that he is about to take a different route and
      should therefore adjust his speed according to the
      signage.<br>
      The Junction Indicators themselves will be set according to a
      given set of Turnouts for that junction.</p>

      <h4><a name="route" id="route">Route Indicators</a></h4>

      <p>A Route Indicator as used in the UK, will display a number
      or letter. They are predominately found attached to Signals
      on the approach to a Station and display which platform the
      train has been routed into. Given the complexity of some
      station throats, there may be a number of different physical
      routes that could be take from the Signal to the destination.
      Thus a Junction Indicator could not be used when tied in with
      turnout positions. In addition the Junction Indicator can
      only deal with 6 different routes, and some stations have
      more than 6 platforms.<br>
      Therefore, the Route Indicator can only display one
      destination at time. The displaying of a route doesn't
      necessarily indicate that the driver will take the same route
      to get to the destination platform.</p>

      Indicators</a></h4><a href=

      alt="Speed Indicator figure by J. Calvert"></a>

      <p>A Speed Indicator as used in Dutch (Prorail) and Belgian
      (NMBS/SNCB) railways will display an illuminated digit below
      the main Signal Head, e.g. a "4" restricts the maximum speed
      to 40 km/h.</p><a name="table" id="table"></a>

      <h3>The Signal Group Table</h3><a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalGroupTable.png"><img
            src="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalGroupTable.png"
      align="right" width="386" height="168" hspace="0" vspace="0"
      alt="Signal Group Table figure"></a>

      <p>JMRI Signal Groups can be created and edited using the
      <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalGroupTable.shtml">
      Signal Group Table</a>. You access this tool from the Tools
      &gt; Tables &gt; Signal Groups menu of most JMRI
      programs.<br>
      In the Signal Group Table you can create, change and delete
      individual Signal Groups. You change the settings of a Signal
      Group by clicking on the "Edit" button in the corresponding
      line.<br>
      More information on configuring Signal Groups and an <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalGroupTable.shtml#example">
      Example</a> can be found on the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalGroupTable.shtml">
      Signal Group Table help page</a>.</p><a name="add" id=
      "add"></a>

      <h3>Creating a Signal Group</h3>

      <p>You add a new Signal Group by clicking on the "Add..."
      button at the bottom of the Signal Group Table, which takes
      you to the <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalGroupAddEdit.shtml">
      "Add Signal Group" panel</a>.</p>

      <h3>Controlling a Signal Group</h3>

      <p>The information from the Signal Group Table is used by the
      Signal Mast Logic to calculate the specified behavior of a
      Signal Group. You can test this by manually changing one of
      the Indicator Signal Heads in de <a href=
      "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalHeadTable.shtml">
      Signal Head Table</a>.</p>

      <h2>Saving and Reloading Configuration</h2>The Signal Groups
      information is saved as part of the JMRI configuration in an
      XML file, along with control panel setup and similar stuff.
      To store your panels in the same file (recommended), select
      <b>File &gt; Store &gt; Store Configuration and Panels To
      File...</b> or select <b>Panels &gt; Store Panels...</b> in
      the main JMRI window.

      <p>For more information on creating and displaying panels,
      including how to show Signals on your Panels, please see the
      <a href="../../apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels help
      pages</a>.</p>
