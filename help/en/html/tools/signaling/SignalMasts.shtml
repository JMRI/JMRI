        <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalMasts-num.png"><img src=

        <p>JMRI Signal Mast objects allow you to display prototypical Aspects on signals. For
        background information, see the <a href="AspectSignaling.shtml">Aspect Signaling</a>
        page.</p>

        <h3>The Signal Mast Table</h3>

        <p>Signal Masts are configured through the <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.shtml">Signal Mast Table</a>. You
        access this tool from the <strong>Tools &rArr; Tables &rArr; Signal Masts</strong> menu.</p>

        <p>From the table, you can manually set individual Signal Masts to any Aspect that they're
        able to display by selecting it from one of the combo boxes in the "Aspect" column.<br>
        You can change the settings of a Signal Mast by clicking the <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">"Edit"</a> button in the
        corresponding line.</p>

        <h3 id="add">Creating a Signal Mast</h3>

        <p>You add a new Signal Mast by clicking on the "Add..." button at the bottom of the Signal
        Mast Table, which takes you to the <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">"Add/Edit Signal Mast"
        pane</a>.</p>

        <h3>Signal Mast Repeaters</h3>
        <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterPane.png" width="291" height="98" class="floatRight"
        alt="signal mast repeaters">
        <p>A Signal Mast Repeater enables one physical (or virtual) signal mast to mimic another
        signal mast's aspect.</p>

        <p>This can be useful in a number of ways:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>When one physical signal mast must provide an aspect which is exactly identical to
          another physical signal mast. This could be used to "repeat" the aspect of a
          "hard-to-see" signal mast on some other easy-to-see signal mast, such as one modeled in
          the fascia of the layout.</li>

          <li>When there are multiple different routes between two physical signal masts, JMRI
          Signal Mast Logic discovery will only identify logic for one of the routes. By providing
          multiple signal masts at the "destination" end of the route, it is possible to manually
          create and configure Signal Mast Logic for each of the alternate routes, such that the
          "source" signal mast displays the correct indication to protect the "destination" signal
          mast, regardless of which route is selected.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>See the <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastRepeater.shtml">Signal
        Mast Repeater</a> documentation for more details.</p>

        <h2>Saving and Reloading Configuration</h2>

        <p>The Signal Mast information is kept in your <em>layout configuration</em>, along with
        Turnouts, Lights, Sensors, control panel setup etc. To save this information on disk,
        allowing you to reload it next time you run JMRI, see <a href=
        "../../apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">Loading and Storing Your Work</a>.</p>

        <p>For more information on creating and displaying panels, including how to show signals on
        your panels, please see the <a href="../../apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels
        pages</a>.</p>
