        <p>JMRI Signal Mast objects allow you to display
        prototypical Aspects on signals. For background
        information, see the <a href="AspectSignaling.shtml">Aspect
        Signaling</a> page.</p>

        <h3>The Signal Mast Table</h3>

        <p>Signal Masts are configured through the <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.shtml">
        Signal Mast Table</a>. You access this tool from the
        <b>Tools &rArr; Tables &rArr; Signal Masts</b> menu.</p>

        <p>From the table, you can manually set individual Signal
        Masts to any Aspect that they're able to display by
        selecting it from one of the combo boxes in the "Aspect" column.<br>
        You can change the settings of a Signal Mast by clicking
        the <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">
            "Edit"</a> button in the corresponding line.</p><a name=
        "add" id="add"></a>

        <h3>Creating a Signal Mast</h3>

        <p>You add a new Signal Mast by clicking on the "Add..."
        button at the bottom of the Signal Mast Table, which takes
        you to the <a href=
        "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">
        "Add/Edit Signal Mast" pane</a>.</p>

        <h3>Signal Mast Repeaters</h3><img src=
        "images/SignalMastRepeaterPane.png" width="291" height="98"
        align="right" alt="signal mast repeaters">

        <p>A Signal Mast Repeater enables one physical (or virtual) signal mast to
            mimic another signal mast's aspect.</p>
        <p>This can be useful in a number of ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When one physical signal mast must provide an aspect which is exactly
                identical to another physical signal mast.  This could be used to
                "repeat" the aspect of a "hard-to-see" signal mast on some other
                easy-to-see signal mast, such as one modeled in the fascia of the
                layout.</li>
            <li>When there are multiple different routes between two physical signal masts,
                JMRI Signal Mast Logic discovery will only identify logic for one
                of the routes.  By providing multiple signal masts at the "destination"
                end of the route, it is possible to manually create and configure
                Signal Mast Logic for each of the alternate routes, such that the
                "source" signal mast displays the correct indication to protect the
                "destination" signal mast, regardless of which route is selected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See the <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastRepeater.shtml">
            Signal Mast Repeater</a> documentation for more details.</p>

        <h2>Saving and Reloading Configuration</h2>

        <p>The Signal Mast information is kept in your <i>layout
        configuration</i>, along with Turnouts, Lights, Sensors,
        control panel setup etc.<br>
        To save this information on disk, allowing you to <a href=
        "../../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">reload
        it</a> next time you run JMRI, see <a href="../../apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">
        Loading and Storing Your Work</a>.</p>

        <p>For more information on creating and displaying
        panels, including how to show signals on your panels,
        please see the <a href=
        "../../apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels pages</a>.</p>
