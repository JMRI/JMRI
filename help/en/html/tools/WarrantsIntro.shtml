      <h1>JMRI: Warrants Introduction</h1>

      <p class="noted">
      <strong>Getting Started:</strong> This page is a brief introduction to warrants with links to other help pages. Read
      the more complete <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/logix/Warrant.shtml">Warrants Help</a>, including the section "Get Started
      with Warrants."  See also the <a href="../../../../community/clinics/">clinic presentation</a> by Dick Bronson: 
      <a href="http://www.rr-cirkits.com/Clinics/Clinics.html"> JMRI 2014: Automatic Train Control Using Warrants</a>
      (in two parts and a little out-of-date, but still useful for getting started). 
      </p>

      <p>A Warrant in JMRI is a collection of information sufficient to run an automated train. It will set the turnouts for
      a specified route and drive the train over the route. When running using block occupancy detection and signal 
      configuration, it will make a best effort to control speed according to signal aspects or by occupancy of other
      trains or other track conditions ahead. Trains can also be tracked on the panel as they run on the layout.
      </p>
      
      <p>A JMRI Warrant is suggestive of what
      a warrant is used for on a prototype railroad, but there is no
      intention to replicate any particular railroad's mode of
      operation. It is simply the idea of giving an automated train
      the trackage rights to move from point A to point B (and then
      move it along).</p>
      
      <p>Warrants are issued using the <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/logis/display/ControlPanelEditor.shtml">
      Control Panel Editor</a> and the <a href="WarrantTable.shtml">The Warrants List</a> which is available in Control Panel
      Editor. The Warrants List is only available when the building blocks for warrants (OBlocks, OPaths, and Portals) have 
      been previously defined. These elements are created by:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>entering data directly into the <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/logix/OBlockEdit.shtml">Occupancy Block
        Table</a> (under Tools&rArr;Tables),</li>
        <li>creating them based on Layout Editor <a href="Blocks.shtml">Blocks</a> (select "Import Blocks as Occupancy 
        Blocks" under <strong>Option</strong> in the Occupancy Block Table window),</li>
        <li>or using the graphical interface of the <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/logix/display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">
        Circuit Builder</a> (also part of Control Panel Editor).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Note that OBlocks, OPaths, and Portals are stored independently of Blocks used by the Layout Editor. 
      Sensors used for determining occupancy can be used simultaneously by both Blocks and OBlocks.
      </p>
      
      <p>Trains are tracked on the CPE panel as they run on the layout if the layout includes
      <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/logix/Tracker.shtml">Indicator Track Icons.</a>
      </p>


     <h2><a name="types" id="types">Warrant Types</a></h2>
     
      <p>There are three types of Warrants available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <b>Recorded Script Warrant</b>, where throttle commands are recorded from a throttle you 
        use to drive a train over preselected route. The Warrant then replicates all the
        commands when played back.</li>

        <li>An <b>NX Warrant</b> (eNtry/eXit), where throttle commands are generated automatically to 
        move a train between Blocks chosen by you "on the fly".</li>

        <li>A <b>Fast Reacting</b> Warrant. This type does not follow the usual Warrant rules, 
        but reacts to signals when entering their approach block with an immediate speed
        change. This type of warrant is better suited to smaller layouts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="creating" id="creating">Creating a Warrant</a></h2>
      
      <p>A Warrant consists of two parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <b>Route</b> over which a Train will run</li>
        <li>the <b>Commands</b> it will receive when running over the
        route.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>To define the commands for a Warrant, you
      drive the train over the route you selected and the commands you
      used are recorded for playback later. For an NX Warrant, commands
      are generated automatically for the route you have selected.</p>

      <h3><a name="CreateRoute" id="CreateRoute">Creating the Route</a></h3>

      <p>A Warrant Route is a series of <em>Block Paths</em> (OBlocks, OPaths) linked together so a train may travel
      over it. A Warrant Route is created by first choosing an <em>Origin block</em> (an OBlock), a starting path (OPath) and a 
      portal (Portal) to exit the Originating block. Then, a <em>Destination block</em> (another OBlock) is chosen and a path 
      (an OPath) on which to end the route. Optionally, you may also choose a <em>Via</em> Block, that is, an OBlock the route 
      <strong>must</strong> include  and an <em>Avoid</em> Block, that is, any OBlock the route <strong>must not</strong>
      include.
      </p>
      
     <h3><a name="record" id="record">Recording the Commands</a></h3>
     
      <p>The second part of a Warrant comprises the throttle commands to control the train as it traverses the route. These commands
      are recorded automatically by running a train over the route in "Learn Mode" or are generated automatically as an "NX 
      Warrant". The command script contain the elapsed time between commands so that playback will attempt to duplicate this timing.
      If, however, a Warrant is run with a different engine or a different consist, or even the same engine depending on whether its
      motor is hot or cold, this timing may not be exact. The command script will synchronize upon entering each detection OBlock by 
      either issuing additional commands immediately if the train is fast or waiting to issue commands if the train is slow.
      </p>
