      <h1>JMRI Setup: Configuration Profiles</h1>

      <p><em>Configuration Profiles</em> allow a single JMRI
      application to be launched with one of multiple
      user-specified Configurations. A Configuration Profile
      contains all Preferences as they are set in the JMRI
      Preferences dialog, and may - optionally - include user
      files, a Roster, and Throttles.</p>

      <p><a href="images/Config_ProfileMigrate314.png"><img src=
      "images/Config_ProfileMigrate314.png" width="438" height=
      "114" align="right" alt=
      "Profile configuration conversion dialog screen"></a> When
      opening an older JMRI configuration in one of the newer
      applications, the way Preferences are stored is converted.
      The application notifies you with this dialog:</p>

      <p>When a JMRI application (version 3.9 and up) is launched
      for the first time, it checks for a Configuration Profile. If
      no Profile exists, the application will create a default
      Profile and use it without prompting you. If only a single
      Profile is found, the application will use that Profile
      without prompting you. If there are multiple Profiles, the
      application will prompt you for the Profile to use. You may
      specify that the application should always start with the
      same Profile.</p>

      <p>By default, when a JMRI application starts up, it prompts
      the user for which Configuration Profile to use: <img src=
      "images/Set_Active_Profile.png"></p>

      <p>If the user doesn't select a new Profile and click OK, the
      program will continue with the default Profile after a short
      delay. You can check a box in the preferences to bypass this
      step and go directly to the last-used Profile.</p>

      <h2>Profile Management</h2>

      <p>Configuration Profiles can be managed in the application
      preferences, under the Profile Configuration
      tab.</p><img src="images/Profile_Preferences_prompt.png">

      <p>The line marked "Current active Profile" in the Status
      column is being used by this run of the JMRI application, and
      is also where Preferences changes will be saved.</p>

      <p>To use or configure a different Profile, select it, click
      "Activate", Save and restart the application.</p>

      <p>For more information on how to configure JMRI to share its
      configuration files between multiple computers, see the
      <a href="Dropbox.shtml">help page on using Dropbox with
      JMRI</a>.</p>

      <h2>Sharing Profiles</h2>

      <h3>Exporting</h3>

      <p>Profiles can be exported from the application preferences
      Config Profile section. An exported Profile is a compressed
      archive containing the Profile's contents, and will
      optionally contain the user files and roster if they are
      stored outside the Profile.</p>

      <h3>Importing</h3>

      <p>JMRI does not yet directly support importing Profiles.</p>

      <p>A Profile can be imported by uncompressing it using an
      archive management utility into a new directory and then
      opening while launching JMRI or from the application's
      Preferences by clicking the "Add Existing..." button.</p>

      <p>Note that using the Profile Import/Export capability to
      copy JMRI data back and forth between two computers is
      neither supported or recommended.</p>

      <h2>Upgrading from Earlier Versions of JMRI</h2>

      <p>When you first run a JMRI application after upgrading from
      an earlier version of JMRI, the application will copy its
      existing configuration to a new Profile, and use that
      Profile. If you are using a JMRI application you had not used
      prior to upgrading, the application will behave as described
      above.</p><!--#include virtual="/Footer" -->
