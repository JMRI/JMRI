      <h1>JMRI Setup: Sharing Files with Dropbox</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target=
      "_blank">Dropbox</a> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com"
      target="_blank"><img src=
      "images/dropbox-logos_dropbox-vertical-blue.png" width="85"
      height="85" align="right"></a> is a free service that lets
      you share files between multiple computers across a network.
      Once you've signed up with Dropbox, you can configure JMRI to
      use it to share Rosters, layout configuration files and other
      information between multiple computers.</p>

      <p>Using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target=
      "_blank">Dropbox</a> rather than a shared folder or network
      drive has a number of advantages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Dropbox keeps a full local copy of all files on every
        computer, bringing a number of benefits.</li>

        <li>JMRI will continue to work even if only one computer is
        on, and even if there is no network connection.</li>

        <li>There will be no speed penalty when accessing files, as
        there with a network connection.</li>

        <li>JMRI data files are not designed for simultaneous
        update access, as can happen with a network connection and
        lead to data corruption. Dropbox works on separate copies
        of files and any simultaneous update is handled gracefully
        by Dropbox. Both versions are saved (with one renamed) and
        if necessary you can choose which one to keep.</li>

        <li>Dropbox protects your files by providing hardware
        redundancy. If a computer fails, the files are still on the
        Dropbox servers and any other computers configured to use
        the same Dropbox account. A shared network drive does not
        provide hardware redundancy by default.</li>

        <li>Dropbox protects your files by providing a limited
        backup recovery facility. You can recover any file version
        or deleted file for the past 30 days, so mistakes can be
        easily reverted. A shared network drive does not provide
        retrievable backup history by default.</li>

        <li>Dropbox protects your files by providing an off-site
        copy of both current and recent (30 days) backup versions.
        A shared network drive does not provide any off-site copy
        by default.</li>

        <li>Dropbox provides clients for Windows, Mac OS and Linux
        computers. All the files in JMRI's <a href=
        "../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#FileLocations"
        target="_blank">User Files Location</a> are stored in an
        operating-system-independent format so can be shared by any
        JMRI client with Dropbox installed. A shared network drive
        may not necessarily provide cross-platform sharing.</li>

        <li>Note that neither Dropbox or a shared network drive
        provide a fully isolated non-live off-line copy (external
        device such as USB drive or CD/DVD) by default. That
        responsibility is still up to you.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The following approach should also work with other
      cloud-based file-synchronisation services such as <a href=
      "https://www.google.com.au/drive/" target="_blank">Google
      Drive</a> and <a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target=
      "_blank">OneDrive</a>. However the <a href=
      "https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>
      solution is well tested, having been used by a number of JMRI
      developers and users for quite some time.</p>

      <h3>Step 1</h3>

      <p>To set up a shared User File Location on the web:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a JMRI folder in Dropbox on the first
        computer.</li>

        <li>If you have already created items (roster entries,
        panels etc.) go to Help&#8209;&gt;Locations and press Open
        User Files Location.<br>
        <a href="images/Help_Locations.png"><img src=
        "images/Help_Locations.png" width="682" height=
        "139"></a><br>
        This will open a window on your desktop showing a
        directory. Remember where that is, because you'll move
        items from there later.</li>

        <li>Still on the Help&#8209;&gt;Locations window, check to
        see if your Roster Location is different from the User
        Files Location. If so, click Open Roster Location to open a
        window on that location. You'll copy files from there
        later.<br>
        <a href="images/Help_Locations_Roster.png"><img src=
        "images/Help_Locations_Roster.png" width="682" height=
        "139"></a></li>

        <li>
        Preferences&#8209;&gt;Roster&#8209;&gt;Roster&#8209;&gt;Roster
        Location&#8209;&gt;Reset. Do not enter a Roster Location.
        That way it will follow the setting for the User Files
        Location.<br>
        <a href="images/Roster_Reset.png"><img src=
        "images/Roster_Reset.png" width="416" height=
        "159"></a></li>

        <li>Preferences&#8209;&gt;File Locations&#8209;&gt;User
        Files Location and set it to the JMRI folder you created in
        Dropbox.<br>
        <a href="images/Locations_Files.png"><img src=
        "images/Locations_Files.png" width="418" height=
        "157"></a></li>

        <li>Restart JMRI and use Help &#8209;&gt; Locations to make
        sure everything is changed correctly.</li>

        <li>If you have already created any files of the types
        listed at this link (see <a href=
        "../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#FileLocations"
        target="_blank">this page</a> for help), move them from the
        old location to your new location. For example, your files
        in the User Files window we opened at the first step should
        be moved to the new User Files Location you just
        created.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2-...</h3>

      <p>The only steps you need to do on subsequent computers
      are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Preferences &#8209;&gt; Roster &#8209;&gt; Roster
        &#8209;&gt; Roster Location &#8209;&gt; Reset. Do not enter
        a Roster Location. That way it will follow the User Files
        Location.</li>

        <li>Preferences &#8209;&gt; Locations &#8209;&gt; User
        Files Location and set it to the JMRI folder you created in
        Dropbox.</li>
