      <h1>JMRI Setup: Sharing Files with GitHub</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>
      is a free service that lets
      you share files between multiple computers across a network
      by storing a common copy in a Git repository.
      After you've signed up with GitHub and configured your
      local machine(s), you can configure JMRI to
      use it to share Rosters, layout configuration files and other
      information between multiple computers.</p>
 
      <p>Note: If you're not familiar with Git and GitHub,
      you might be better off using 
      <a href="Dropbox.shtml">Dropbox</a>
      to share files between computers.  Git and GitHub
      are a full-featured software version control system, 
      which makes them more complex than the almost-automatic
      nature of Dropbox.  Git and Github will let you control
      when changes are stored, have multiple versions on branches, 
      and in general manage your JMRI configurations very closely;
      but if you just want share files, Dropbox may be easier.
      
      <p>Using Git has some advantages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>In normal use, Git will keep the entire
            history of your files locally so that you can 
            always back up to an earlier configuration.</li>

        <li>Git provides every powerful tools for managing 
            updates when you're making changes on multiple
            computers, i.e. the main layout computer
            and some convenient laptoo.

        <li>Git can be used with a sneaker-net connection
            by pushing/pulling from a copy of a repository
            on a USB stick.
      </ul>

      <p>The following approach should also work with other
      cloud-based file-synchronisation services such as <a href=
      "https://www.google.com.au/drive/" target="_blank">Google
      Drive</a> and <a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target=
      "_blank">OneDrive</a>. However the <a href=
      "https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>
      solution is well tested, having been used by a number of JMRI
      developers and users for quite some time.</p>

      <h3>Step 1</h3>

      <p>To set up a shared User File Location on the web:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a JMRI folder under Git control on the first
        computer. If you want to use GitHub, the steps are:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/join">Create a GitHub account</a> if you don't have one.
            <li>Create a new repository on GitHub using the "New" button on your
                Repositories pane.
            <li>Click the button named "(downarrow) Code" and copy the URL for your repository.
            <li>On your computer, in the directory you want to contain your JMRI files,
                check that repository out with (for example):
<pre>
            git clone https://github.com/myaccountname/JMRI.git
</pre>
        </ul>
        </li>

        <li>If you have already created items (roster entries,
        panels etc.) go to Help&#8209;&gt;Locations and press Open
        User Files Location.<br>
        <a href="images/Help_Locations.png"><img src=
        "images/Help_Locations.png" width="682" height=
        "139"></a><br>
        This will open a window on your desktop showing a
        directory. Remember where that is, because you'll move
        items from there later.</li>

        <li>Still on the Help&#8209;&gt;Locations window, check to
        see if your Roster Location is different from the User
        Files Location. If so, click Open Roster Location to open a
        window on that location. You'll copy files from there
        later.<br>
        <a href="images/Help_Locations_Roster.png"><img src=
        "images/Help_Locations_Roster.png" width="682" height=
        "139"></a></li>

        <li>
        Preferences&#8209;&gt;Roster&#8209;&gt;Roster&#8209;&gt;Roster
        Location&#8209;&gt;Reset. Do not enter a Roster Location.
        That way it will follow the setting for the User Files
        Location.<br>
        <a href="images/Roster_Reset.png"><img src=
        "images/Roster_Reset.png" width="416" height=
        "159"></a></li>

        <li>Preferences&#8209;&gt;File Locations&#8209;&gt;User
        Files Location and set it to the JMRI folder you created in
        Dropbox.<br>
        <a href="images/Locations_Files.png"><img src=
        "images/Locations_Files.png" width="418" height=
        "157"></a></li>

        <li>Restart JMRI and use Help &#8209;&gt; Locations to make
        sure everything is changed correctly.</li>

        <li>If you have already created any files of the types
        listed at this link (see <a href=
        "../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#FileLocations"
        target="_blank">this page</a> for help), move them from the
        old location to your new location. For example, your files
        in the User Files window we opened at the first step should
        be moved to the new User Files Location you just
        created.</li>
        
        <li>Use "git add", "git commit" to move
            all those files under Git's control.
        <li>Finally, "git push" to push the contents back up to GitHub.
            
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2-...</h3>

      <p>The only steps you need to do on subsequent computers
      are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"git clone" with the roster URL to make your initial download of the
            repository ("git pull" after that)
        <li>Preferences &#8209;&gt; Roster &#8209;&gt; Roster
        &#8209;&gt; Roster Location &#8209;&gt; Reset. Do not enter
        a Roster Location. That way it will follow the User Files
        Location.</li>

        <li>Preferences &#8209;&gt; Locations &#8209;&gt; User
        Files Location and set it to the JMRI folder you created in
        Dropbox.</li>
        
        <h2>Sneaker Net</h2>
        
        First, copy the <u>entire</u> directory from one of your 
        computers to the USB stick.  This will be a master that you're moving
        around.  (You can also directly `git clone` onto the USB stick.)
        
        <p>
        Then, from your computer's JMRI preferences Git directory, 
        you can bring the USB stick up to date with your directory with
<pre>
            git commit -m"really lucid comment" .
            git push /path/to/USB/directory
</pre>

        <p>
        Similarly, you can get the contents from the USB stick with
<pre>
            git pull /path/to/USB/directory
</pre>
