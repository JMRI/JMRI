      <h1>JMRI Setup: Migrating System Prefixes</h1>

      <a href="../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">JMRI system names</a>
      are supposed to have a 
      <a href="../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#format">specific format</a>
      that starts with a "system prefix" consisting of a single
      letter, optionally followed by digits.
      Unfortunately, for a while JMRI wasn't enforcing that properly, and 
      in a few cases JMRI set itself up with prefixes that contained
      multiple letters.  This can cause significant 
      long term problems, so we're getting people to migrate their 
      configurations and panel files to the proper format.
      
      <h2 id="if">Does this affect me?</h2>
      You can check if this is an issue for your setup any of a couple ways:
      <ul>
      <li>Open the Preferences, and look at each of the "Connection" panes.  If the connection prefix 
            has a letter or a single letter plus digits, this doesn't affect you.
            If it has more than a single letter, you should do this migration.
            (With JMRI 4.13.4 or later, the background will be colored red 
            and the tooltip will say "This is a legacy prefix that should be migrated, ask on JMRIusers" 
            if the prefix needs to be migrated)
      <li>Check the system log after running and quiting the program to see if there's a 
            warning message about "The following system names need to be migrated..."
            If it's there, you should do this migration.
      </ul>
      
      <h2 id="do">How to fix the issue</h2>
      
      To fix this issue, you update your configuration and panel files to
      use new prefixes.

      <ul>
      <li>First, you should be using JMRI 4.12 or later. If you're using an earlier
            version, please update to at least JMRI 4.12 and fix any problems.
      <li>Next, ask for help on the JMRIusers mailing list.  
            There are people there who will happily do the necessary file modifications.
      </ul>
