      <h1>JMRI Setup: Migrating System Prefixes</h1>

      <a href="../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">JMRI system names</a>
      are supposed to have a 
      <a href="../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#format">specific format</a>
      that starts with a "system prefix" consisting of a single
      letter, optionally followed by digits.
      Unfortunately, for a while JMRI wasn't enforcing that properly, and 
      in a few cases JMRI set itself up with prefixes that contained
      multiple letters.  This can cause significant 
      long term problems, so we're getting people to migrate their 
      configurations and panel files to the proper format.
      
      <h2 id="if">Does this affect me?</h2>
      You can check if this is an issue for your setup any of a couple ways:
      <ul>
      <li>Open the Preferences, and look at each of the "Connection" panes.  If the connection prefix 
            has a letter or a single letter plus digits, this doesn't affect you.
            If it has more than a single letter, you should do this migration.
            (With 
            <a href="/releasenotes/jmri4.13.4.shtml">JMRI 4.13.4</a>
            or later, the background will be colored red 
            and the tooltip will say "This is a legacy prefix that should be migrated, ask on JMRIusers" 
            if the prefix needs to be migrated)
      <li>Check the system log after running and quiting the program to see if there's a 
            warning message about "The following system names need to be migrated..."
            If it's there, you should do this migration.
      </ul>
      
      <h2 id="do">How to fix the issue</h2>
      
      To fix this issue, you update your configuration and panel files to
      use new prefixes.

      <ul>
      <li>First, you should be using 
            <a href="/releasenotes/jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>
            or later. If you're using an earlier
            version, please update to at least 
            <a href="/releasenotes/jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>
            and fix any problems.
      <li>If your computer is connected to the Internet, please upload your configuration as 
            debugging information as described on
            <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/mailreport/Report.shtml">this page</a>.
            This will make it easy for the people who help you in the next step 
            to see exactly what's needed.
      <li>Next, ask for help on the 
            <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRI users group</a>.  
            There are people there who will happily do the necessary file modifications.
       </ul>
      
      <h2 id="not">What happens if I don't  make this change?</h2>
      
      If you don't make this change, your existing JMRI installation will keep working fine.
      <p>
      If/when you update to newer versions of JMRI:
      <ul>
      <li>When you update to JMRI 4.15.3 or later, you'll start getting prompts
            about fixing this every time you start JMRI.
      <li>If you update to JMRI 4.17.1 or later (summer 2019)
            without fixing this, you won't be able to use your
            existing configuration or panel files.
      </ul>
      We're sorry for this inconvenience, but we really do have to fix this.
      Giving people over 18 months lead time seems sufficient.
