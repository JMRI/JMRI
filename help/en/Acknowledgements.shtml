<h2>Developer Code Swarm</h2>
<p>We have created a <a href="http://jmri.org/community/codeswarm.shtml">Code Swarm of JMRI
development</a> from its inception to January 2009.  A Code Swarm is a fascinating
and dynamic visual representation of change as developers come and go and make
changes to the files that make up a project.  More information is available on
the <a href="http://jmri.org/community/codeswarm.shtml">Code Swarm</a> page.</p>
