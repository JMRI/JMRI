<h1>JMRI Help</h1>
<p>This is the top-level Help page for JMRI.</p>

<p>
The <a href="Acknowledgements.shtml">acknowledgements page</a>
shows that a lot of people have been able to contribute.</p>

<h2>Using The Help System</h2>

<p>If you're viewing this via the program's Help tool,
the section to the left gives you three types of access to JMRI's help.</p>
<ul>
<li>The "book" icon shows a <a href="webtoc.shtml">Table of Contents</a> view
<li>The "tabbed" icon shows the <a href="webindex.shtml">Index</a>
<li>The "magnifying glass" icon lets you search the contents
</ul>

<p>If you're viewing this on the web, the links above will get you to
the corresponding sections.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>The main JMRI web page <a href="http://jmri.org">http://jmri.org</a>
is a good place to start for information about current status, updates, etc.<br />
(Depending on your computer, you might have to copy that link to 
your web browser to be able to see external sites properly).</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-announce">jmri-announce</a> 
mailing list carries announcements of new versions, major changes, etc.  
This list is intended to be very low traffic; discussions, etc. should take place elsewhere.
You can subscribe
by sending the word "subscribe" in the subject or body of an email to 
<a href="mailto:jmri-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net">jmri-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
<p>
We have a "JMRI Users" Yahoo group for general discussion. If you want to ask a question, get some
help, or suggest some improvement, that discussion group is a good place. You can
subscribe, browse posts, etc. at 
<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/</a>.</p>

<p>
Our <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical web pages</a> are continually being updated.
We're always short of documentation, so if you're interested
in working with the code or updating some Help files, we'd love to help you <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">get started</a>.</p>
