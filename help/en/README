English JmriHelp files for JMRI

This directory contains metadata for the jmrihelp sub-system,
plus the actual content.

There are several content subtrees:
  manual - a help version of the original DecoderPro manual
  html - a help-customized version of the web site
  package - package-sensitive help, organized by Java package

The template-no-sidebar.shtml and template-sidebar.shtml files
are basic templates to copy when making a new file.

For more information on maintaining the various metadata in the
help system, please see:
<https://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Help.shtml>

The build.xml and format.xsl files are used to create the webtoc.html
and webindex.shtml files automatically. Those use Server-Side Includes
to display the standard JMRI header and footer, and also some
explanatory content from the tocheader and indexheader files.
