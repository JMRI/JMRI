    <li>Panel file NamedBean items such as Turnouts, Sensors, etc are now written to panel
        files in order by their Manager system prefix and system name.
        Previously, they had (roughly) been written in the order they'd be 
        read from the earlier file(s). This will result in a big change to the order
        the first time a file is re-written, but after that it should be much more stable.</li>
