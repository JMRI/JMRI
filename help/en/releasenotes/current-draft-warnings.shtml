        The way mouse clicks are handled has been updated.
        Although this has been tested with mice and trackpads, 
        it's possible that this will cause problems with other hardware, 
        e.g. touch panels.  If you do encounter new problems with clicking
        on panels, please contact us on the 
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRI users list</a>.
