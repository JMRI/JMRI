    <li>JMRI no longer modifies "system names" as provided by the user. There may
        be cases where a script or panel file is creating an object with a system
        name that is slightly different than a system name used elsewhere, and
        JMRI used to change these to be the same. Users may have to modify scripts
        and panel files to ensure system names match in all places.</li>
