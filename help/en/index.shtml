    <h1>JMRI Help</h1>

    <p>This is the top-level Help page for JMRI.</p>

    <p>The <a href="Acknowledgements.shtml">acknowledgements page</a> shows that a lot of people
    have been able to contribute.</p>

    <h2>Using The JMRI Help System</h2>

    <p>If you're viewing this via the JMRI Help menu, the section to the left is a table of
    contents. Clicking on an entry will load the help page in the right section.</p>

    <p>In JMRI, selecting <strong>Preferences &rArr; Help</strong> provides three options.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Open help pages locally</strong>: The help pages will be loaded from your JMRI
      install location. This means that the pages will be based on the installed JMRI version. This
      is the default option.</li>

      <li>
        <strong>Open help pages online</strong>: The help page will be displayed by linking to
        <a href="https://jmri.org">jmri.org</a>. The content on the JMRI website might be more
        recent than the content in the local JMRI install location. The page will have the standard
        navigation bar, sidebars and CSS formatting. This option requires that an internet
        connection is available.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Open help pages using the web server in JMRI</strong>: This is a future
      capability.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Further information</h2>

    <p>The main JMRI web page, <a href="https://jmri.org">https://jmri.org</a>, is a good place to
    start for information about current status, updates, etc.<br>
    (Depending on your computer, you might have to copy that link to your web browser to be able to
    see external sites properly).</p>

    <p>We have a Groups.io discussion area, JMRI Users. This group is the place to discuss any
    aspect of JMRI. If you have questions about how to do things, suggestions or even complaints,
    post them there. You can subscribe, browse posts, etc. at <a href=
    "https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/</a>.</p>

    <p>Our <a href="https://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical web
    pages</a> are continually being updated. We're always short of documentation, so if you're
    interested in working with the code or updating some Help files, we'd love to help you <a href=
    "https://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">get started</a>.</p>
