    <h1>JMRI Help</h1>

    <p>This is the top-level Help page for JMRI.</p>

    <p>The <a href="Acknowledgements.shtml">acknowledgements
    page</a> shows that a lot of people have been able to
    contribute.</p>

    <h2>Using The Help System</h2>

    <p>If you're viewing this via the program's Help tool, the
    section to the left gives you three types of access to JMRI's
    help.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The "book" icon shows a <a href="webtoc.shtml">Table of
      Contents</a> view</li>

      <li>The "tabbed" icon shows the <a href=
      "webindex.shtml">Index</a></li>

      <li>The "magnifying glass" icon lets you search the
      contents</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you're viewing this on the web, the links above will get
    you to the corresponding sections.</p>

    <h2>Further information</h2>

    <p>The main JMRI web page <a href=
    "http://jmri.org">http://jmri.org</a> is a good place to start
    for information about current status, updates, etc.<br>
    (Depending on your computer, you might have to copy that link
    to your web browser to be able to see external sites
    properly).</p>

    <p>The <a href=
    "https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-announce">jmri-announce</a>
    mailing list carries announcements of new versions, major
    changes, etc. This list is intended to be very low traffic;
    discussions, etc. should take place elsewhere. You can
    subscribe by sending the word "subscribe" in the subject or
    body of an email to <a href=
    "mailto:jmri-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net">jmri-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

    <p>We have a Groups.io discussion area, JMRI Users.
    This group is the place to discuss any aspect of JMRI.
    If you have questions about how to do things, suggestions or even complaints, post them there.
    You can subscribe, browse posts, etc. at <a href=
    "https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/</a>.</p>

    <p>Our <a href=
    "http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical
    web pages</a> are continually being updated. We're always short
    of documentation, so if you're interested in working with the
    code or updating some Help files, we'd love to help you
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">
    get started</a>.</p>
