    <h1>JMRI Help</h1>

    <p>This is the top-level Help page for JMRI.</p>

    <p>The <a href="Acknowledgements.shtml">acknowledgements page</a> shows that a lot of
    people have been able to contribute.</p>

    <h2>Using The JMRI Help System</h2>

    <p>If you're viewing this via the JMRI Help menu, the section to the left is a table
    of contents.  Clicking on an entry will load the help page in the right section.</p>

    <p>In JMRI, selecting <strong>Preferences &rArr; Help</strong> provides three options.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Open help pages locally</strong>: The help pages will be loaded from your
      JMRI install location.  This means that the pages will be based on the installed
      JMRI version.  This is the default option.</li>

      <li><strong>Open help pages online</strong>: The help page will be displayed by
      linking to <a href="https://jmri.org">jmri.org</a>.  The content on the JMRI website
      might be more recent than the content in the local JMRI install location.  The page
      will have the standard navigation bar, sidebars and CSS formatting.  This option
      requires that an internet connection is available.</li>

      <li><strong>Open help pages using the web server in JMRI</strong>: This is a future
      capability.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Further information</h2>

    <p>The main JMRI web page, <a href=
    "https://jmri.org">https://jmri.org</a>, is a good place to start for information about
    current status, updates, etc.<br>  (Depending on your computer, you might have to copy
    that link to your web browser to be able to see external sites properly).</p>

    <p>We have a Groups.io discussion area, JMRI Users. This group is the place to discuss
    any aspect of JMRI.  If you have questions about how to do things, suggestions or even
    complaints, post them there.  You can subscribe, browse posts, etc. at
    <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/</a>.</p>

    <p>Our <a href=
    "https://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical web pages</a> are
    continually being updated. We're always short of documentation, so if you're interested
    in working with the code or updating some Help files, we'd love to help you
    <a href="https://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/getgitcode.shtml">
    get started</a>.</p>
