      <h1>The Basic Programmer</h1>

      <h2>Basic Pane</h2>

      <div align="right">

        "Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">Next</a></p>

        Index</a></p>
      </div>
      <hr>

      <p>You may have noticed that at the top of the window are Two
      tabs: <strong>Roster Entry</strong> and
      <strong>Basic</strong>. We have completed the <strong>Roster
      Entry</strong> pane of the Program window, now, click on the
      <strong>Basic</strong> tab to change panes to continue with
      programming your decoder. The Basic pane will be displayed
      and look similar to the following illustration: Many panes in
      the programmer contain decoder dependent features, as a
      result what you see may not exactly agree with what you see
      here. Only those variables that your decoder can implement
      will be shown.</p>

      <div align="center">
        <img style="width: 636px; height: 556px;" src=
        "images/Basic_Program.png" alt="Basic pane">
      </div>

      <p>You will see three options you can change, highlighted in
      yellow:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The decoder address (should be unique among your
        locomotives, unless you are operating as a set) often the
        locomotive number is used.</li>

        <li>Two radio buttons that let you toggle between 2 digit
        (one byte, normal) or 4 digit<br>
        (two byte, extended) addressing</li>

        <li>Analog operation (enables the decoder running under
        regular DC voltage/analog<br>
        control)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The yellow highlighting indicates these options are
      "probable" settings and have not been confirmed from the
      decoder. Settings that have been changed by the user and have
      not been written back to the decoder appear in a orange
      color.</p>

      <p>Color Codes used in the programming panes.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt style=
        "background: rgb(221, 221, 221) none repeat scroll 0%; color: orange; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">
        Edited</dt>

        <dd>You've changed this value, or it contains default
        values from the decoder file. This is shown as orange,
        since the value differs from what's in the decoder.</dd>

        <dt style=
        "background: rgb(221, 221, 221) none repeat scroll 0%; color: yellow; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">
        From File</dt>

        <dd>The field contains values read from a locomotive file.
        This is shown as yellow, since we're not certain that the
        file agrees with the decoder contents.</dd>

        <dt style=
        "background: rgb(221, 221, 221) none repeat scroll 0%; color: white; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">
        Read</dt>

        <dd>The value shown has been read from the decoder. This is
        shown as white to indicate that the value is
        trustworthy.</dd>

        <dt style=
        "background: rgb(221, 221, 221) none repeat scroll 0%; color: white; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">
        Stored</dt>

        <dd>The value show has been written to the decoder. This is
        also shown as white.</dd>

        <dt style=
        "background: rgb(221, 221, 221) none repeat scroll 0%; color: red; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">
        Unknown</dt>

        <dd>If something goes wrong with the read or write process,
        we might have a completely untrustworthy result. This
        results in the variable's state being marked as UNKNOWN and
        shown as red.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>You will see examples of<br>
      this throughout the manual.</p><a name="ReadData"></a> To
      read the actual settings for these options (and IF your
      system and installed decoder will allow readback of decoder
      values), click on the <strong><input name="button" id=
      "button" value="Read full sheet" type="button"></strong> .
      The individual settings will turn red while they are in the
      process of being read (clever, eh?), and will turn white once
      the values have been read successfully from the decoder. Once
      again, DecoderPro must play "Twenty Questions" to get this
      information, and sometimes even has to ask a couple of times.

      <p>Be patient, especially with older computers. At the very
      bottom of the pane (where it says "idle") you will see a
      running account of exactly what DecoderPro is doing, for
      example, the specific CV being read.</p>

      <p>Again, the <input name="button2" id="button2" value=
      "Read full sheet" type="button"> and <strong><input name=
      "button3" id="button3" value="Read all sheets" type=
      "button"></strong> functions are dependent on your Command
      Station. If your system does not have the capability to read
      CVs, then these buttons will not be available.</p>

      <p><a name="EnterEditData"></a>If you wish to change the
      address of the locomotive, type in the new address. To turn
      on or off 4 digit addressing, select the desired radio
      button. . Be sure that the address type agrees with the
      number of characters in the address.</p>

      <p>To enable Analog (old style DC, some vendors refer to this
      as dual mode) Operation select the appropriate entry from the
      drop-down list.</p>

      <p>When you are finished, click on <input name="button4" id=
      "button4" value="Write full sheet" type="button"> to write
      the new values in the decoder.</p>

      <p><a name="WriteData"></a>Writing usually takes much less
      time than reading, because the value can be sent directly. As
      the write operation proceeds, the data will change from
      yellow to white. If there is difficulty writing to the
      decoder, the data will change to red. The software will
      automatically keep trying until the write operation is
      successful. In some instances the system will "time-out"
      after a certain number of tries without an acknowledgement
      from the decoder. This does not necessarily mean that the
      values have not been written, just that the program has not
      received an acknowledgement. This can be due to the
      locomotive moving and getting on dirty track so that it can't
      pulse back, or possibly because the command station or
      decoder cannot read back. Try moving the loco and try again.
      If it is a command station or decoder read-back issue, try
      the loco on the mainline and see if the programming was
      successful.</p>

      <p><a name="SaveData"></a> To finish this "basic"
      programming of a decoder, click once more on the
      <strong>Roster Entry</strong> tab, You will see that the
      address field has now been filled in, so you can now click on
      the <strong><input name="button5" id="button5" value=
      "Save to roster" type="button"></strong> . Your new decoder
      settings have now been written not only to the decoder, but
      also saved to a computer file where they may be recalled in
      the future. .</p>
      <a name="DoMore"></a> But you say..."I want
      to change more than what's shown on the Basic decoder pane."
      Well&hellip; there are other programmers that are available.
      But&hellip; first we need to look at the various options. In
      fact there are so many options the programmers had to use a
      slider to get them all to show. Here are the option windows.
      Don't panic&hellip;.Most are of no use to the average user.

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Basic_programmers.png"
      alt="Basic Programmers" height="341" width="568"><br></p>

      <p><strong>Comprehensive</strong> and Advanced are the only
      other programmers "<strong><em>Normal Users</em>"</strong>
      will ever need, because it is,
      well&hellip;<strong>Comprehensive</strong> and the
      <strong>Advanced</strong> adds features that are optional..
      So why all the others?</p>

      <p>First of all eliminate the Manufacturer specific
      programmers (unless of course you have a
      <strong>Zimo</strong> or <strong>ESU</strong> system).</p>

      <p>We can also eliminate the <strong>Tutorial</strong> and
      <strong>Custom</strong> programmers. They were put in to show
      folks that want to <strong>write their own</strong>
      programmer (not you right?) all the possible ways to gather
      input and to have a common starting point in the roster pane.
      Now if you wish to pursue writing a custom programmer go to
      the JMRI&reg; website.</p>

      <p>If you have need for a special situation programmer you
      might want to look at <strong>Sample Club</strong> or
      <strong>TrainShowBasic</strong> to see what panes can be
      taken out of Comprehensive to make an intermediate
      complexity, special purpose programmer. Again, how to do this
      is a subject for another manual.</p>

      <p>And that leaves us with the <strong>Advanced</strong> and
      <strong>Registers</strong> programmers. The
      <strong>Advanced</strong> programmer has a couple of
      sophisticated features added on top of the
      <strong>Comprehensive</strong> programmer and a name was
      needed. Well, why not call it <strong>Advanced</strong>?
      We'll cover the additional features once we get through with
      <strong>Comprehensive</strong>.<br>
      So what about the <strong>Registers</strong> programmer? If
      you have an old or bargain basement decoder that only
      programs using registers, then of course you'll be interested
      in <strong>Registers.</strong><br>
      So now we've narrowed our "real" choices down to
      <strong>Advanced</strong>, <strong>Basic</strong> and
      <strong>Comprehensive</strong>. Since we've already covered
      <strong>Basic</strong>, let's explore the <a href=
      "Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">Comprehensive Programmer</a>!</p>
