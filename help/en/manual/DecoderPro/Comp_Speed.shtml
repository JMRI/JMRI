      <p>The<strong>Basic Speed Control pane</strong> looks very
      complicated, but it can be one of the most significant in
      improving the performance of your locomotive fleet.</p>

      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img style=
      "width: 726px; height: 389px;" src=
      "images/Speed_Table_Main.png" alt="Speed pane"></h1>

      <p>Let's look first at the top of the pane: You now have the
      option of using Basic Speed Control (this pane) or Speed
      Table to control your locomotive's speed. Which ever one you
      select last and write to your decoder will be the method used
      for speed control. To select this pane:</p>

      <p>Depending upon the decoder manufacturer, any of these
      settings could be on this pane.</p>

      <p>Capability to select the <strong>Use Vstart, Vmid,
      Vhigh</strong> settings..</p>

      <p>Three important CVs are programmed in this pane Vstart,
      Vmid and Vhigh. They work together to make a very basic three
      point speed table. On some decoders these settings may be
      labeled differently and all three may not be available.
      Decoder Pro will show the correct options for your selected
      decoder.</p>

      <p><b>Vstart</b>(<strong>Start Voltage</strong>) is the
      voltage at the first speed step. If your locomotive didn't
      start moving until there were three volts on the track with
      analog power, this lets you set up the decoder to give it
      2.99 volts right away, so it will start moving when you
      advance the throttle.</p>

      <p><b>Vhigh(Top Voltage, Max Voltage, Maximum Voltage)</b> is
      the maximum amount of power the locomotive will get from the
      decoder. If your locomotive looks like Chuck Yeager's X-1 at
      full throttle, then you can trim the top speed down to a more
      reasonable scale level.</p>

      <p><b>Vmid</b>(<strong>Mid Voltage, Midpoint
      Voltage)</strong> lets you configure the slope between
      <b>Vstart</b> and <b>Vhigh</b> a bit, so that if your
      locomotive reaches full speed at 5 volts, you can stretch out
      the lower end of the curve to get more fine control in a
      useful speed range.</p>

      <p>If you are having problems with unpredictable speeds with
      your locomotives, check these settings. Sometimes, one or
      more of these settings have been changed accidentally
      (usually due to an error in programming CV's with a
      throttle), leading to very odd speed performance. In
      particular, if the <strong>Vmid</strong> is lower than
      <strong>Vstart</strong> or higher than
      <strong>Vhigh</strong>, results can be highly unpredictable.
      Decoder Pro will not let you make this mistake.</p>

      <p><b>Forward Trim</b> and <b>Reverse Trim</b> allow you to
      compensate for differences in the forward speed and reverse
      speed of the locomotive. Most model locomotives do not run at
      exactly the same speed forward and backward due to the motor
      mechanics and the gear train to the wheels.</p>

      <p>The settings for these controls are not as intuitive as
      you might think. A setting of 0 in these CVs turns them off.
      However, a setting of 128 in either of them will have no
      visible effect! To make the forward and reverse trim
      effective, raise the value above 128 to increase speed, and
      lower it below 128 to decrease speed in this pane. The
      Forward and Reverse Trim does not work the same for all
      decoders, with variations between manufacturers.</p>

        <h3>Some suggestions on using the basic motor controls and
        programming on the main.</h3>

        <p>Unless you want to get into some precision speed
        matching, you probably won't need to use the <b>Speed
        Tables</b> you'll see on the <a href=
        "Comp_Speed_Talble.shtml" target="_parent"><strong>Speed
        Table pane</strong></a>- you'll be able to accomplish much
        of what you want using just <b>Kick start</b> (<a href=
        "Comp_Motor.shtml">previous pane</a>), and <b>Start
        Volts</b>, <b>Mid Volts</b>, and <b>Max Volts</b> if they
        are available in this pane... but how to do this?</p>

        <p>Start with the <b>Kick start</b> value, and <a href=
        "Basic_Programming.shtml#OpsMode">Programming on the
        main</a> rather than the programming track. Set the
        locomotive to be programmed on throttle step 1. If it moves
        <span class="ACCENT">at all</span>, don't change the
        <b>Kick start</b> value. If it doesn't move, slowly step up
        the throttle until it does. Then, turn the throttle down.
        If the locomotive stops at the same setting it started, you
        won't need to set the <b>Kick start</b> value. However, if
        it continues to run at a slower speed than it would start,
        then increase the <b>Kick start</b> value until it will
        start and run at its slowest possible speed.</p>

        <p>Now, if the locomotive isn't running at throttle step 1,
        increase the <b>Start Volts</b> value (and write it)
        without changing the throttle until the locomotive
        <span class="ACCENT">barely</span> crawls... you can
        usually get this down to a speed of a tie a minute or so if
        you like! Remember, you are doing this in "<b>ops
        mode</b>", so you can make these changes while the
        locomotive is actually running. Don't forget to write the
        value changes to the decoder - they won't take effect
        unless you do.</p>

        <p>Now, set the top speed of the locomotive. Run the
        throttle up to full, and lower the <b>Max Volts</b> value
        (and write it) until the locomotive runs at the maximum
        speed you want it to reach, but don't forget that adding a
        train will slow it down!</p>

        <p>Finally, set the <b>Mid Volts</b> value about half-way
        between <b>Start Volts</b> and <b>Max Volts</b>. Setting it
        above or below the median of the <b>Start Volts</b> and
        <b>Max Volts</b> values will give you a crude, three point
        speed table.</p>

        <p>There are no hard and fast rules for the exact numbers
        to use. Even identical locomotives with identical decoders
        will need different numbers, due to variances in motors and
        drive trains. Experiment with the settings - Decoder Pro
        makes it easy!</p>

        <p>Note: Not all decoders will have Start, Mid and Max
        Volts, but will have some version of this which will be
        displayed by Decoder Pro for the specific decoder.</p>
