      <p>For the hard-core programmer, this pane is a listing of
      the raw CV data by CV number, with data in <span class=
      "ACCENT">decimal format</span>. You may change data by typing
      new numbers into the <b>Values</b> window. <b>State</b> shows
      the validity of the data, whether it was taken <b>From
      file</b> (the decoder information saved in the
      <b>Roster</b>), <b>Edited</b>, <b>Read</b> directly from the
      decoder, <b>Stored</b> to the decoder or if the status is
      <b>Unknown</b>. Note the <b>scroll bar</b> on the right side
      of the listings. You may scroll up or down to access all of
      the CV listings.</p>

      <h4>Decoder Locking</h4>

      <p>You tried to read a CV value and get "Error 308, No
      Acknowledgement from Decoder", well the decoder may be
      locked. CV 15 and 16 deal with locking, if your manufacturer
      implements this feature (and manufacturers have slight
      differences as to how they implement it). If the decoder is
      locked, then you will not be able to read data from it or
      write to it. To unlock the decoder, you must enter a value
      into CV15 (the only CV that can be written when the decoder
      is locked), that is equal to the value that is currently in
      CV16. Now I hear you thinking "but I can't read CV16 to know
      what to put into CV15". Well, you'll have to try all possible
      values, which isn't that hard since it can only have 8
      possible values 0 thru 7. After each write, try to read CV16.
      It's the fastest read since it can only have 8 possible
      values. If JMRI responds with the no-ack error, then try the
      next value. If it returns the value in CV16, you've unlocked
      the decoder and you're in. If you have unsuccessfully tried
      all the 8 possibilities, then check your layout connection
      and the loco's wheels for poor connections and try again. Now
      you say, "I've looked thru the list several times and CV 15
      doesn't appear". That's on purpose, to minimize inadvertent
      locking by a Write All Sheets. You will have to use the
      <a href="Simple_Programmer.shtml">Single CV Programmer</a> to
      write CV15. It can be found in the Tools menu on the Main
      Page, under Programmers.</p>

      <p>If you have more than one decoder in your locomotive, you
      probably have a decoder locking scheme implemented to be able
      to access each one individually for programming. There is a
      <a href="Multi_Decoder_Control.shtml">Multi-decoder
      control</a> tool in JMRI. It is located on the main window
      under Tools menu, programmers option. It is accompanied with
      a comprehensive help describing its use.</p>

      <p>You may <b>Read</b> or <b>Write</b> individual CVs using
      the buttons in their row. On this page, a <b>Read sheet</b>
      or <b>Write sheet</b> operation is the same as a <b>Read
      all</b> or <b>Write all</b>. <span class="ACCENT">Again, a
      reminder: you can only read CVs if your command station has
      that capability.</span></p>

      src="images/Comp_11_CV.png" alt="CVs"></p>

      <p>One thing to keep in mind about the <b>CV</b> listing on
      this pane - anything you can do here you can do from one of
      the other panes in DecoderPro, without having to know the
      <b>CV</b> number or how to compile the values to get the
      desired effect. This pane is meant for advanced users of DCC
      used to crunching the numbers themselves. Those new to DCC
      can safely ignore this panel without losing any capability at
      all.</p>
