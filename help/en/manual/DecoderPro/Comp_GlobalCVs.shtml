For the hard-core programmer, this pane is a listing of the raw CV
data by CV number, with data in <span class="ACCENT">decimal format</span>.
You may change data by typing new numbers into the <b>Values</b> window.
<b>State</b> shows the validity of the data, whether it was taken <b>From file </b>(the decoder information saved in the <b>Roster</b>), <b>Edited</b>,
<b>Read</b> directly from the decoder, <b>Stored</b> to the decoder or if the status is <b>Unknown</b>. Note the <b>scroll bar</b> on
the right side of the listings. You may scroll up or down to access all
of the CV listings.</p>
<h4>Decoder Locking
</h4>
<p> You tried to read a CV value and get &#8220;Error 308, No Acknowledgement
from Decoder&#8221;, well the decoder may be locked. CV 15 and 16 deal
with locking, if your manufacturer implements this feature (and
manufacturers have slight differences as to how they implement
it).&nbsp; If the decoder is locked, then you will not be able to read
data from it or write to it.&nbsp; To unlock the decoder, you must
enter a value into CV15 (the only CV that can be written when the
decoder is locked), that is equal to the value that is currently in
CV16.&nbsp; Now I hear you thinking &#8220;but I can&#8217;t read CV16 to know what
to put into CV15&#8221;.&nbsp; Well, you&#8217;ll have to try all possible
values,&nbsp; which isn&#8217;t that hard since it can only have 8 possible
values 0 thru 7.&nbsp; After each write, try to read CV16.&nbsp; It&#8217;s
the fastest read since it can only have 8 possible values.&nbsp; If
JMRI responds with the no-ack error, then try the next value.&nbsp; If
it returns the value in CV16, you&#8217;ve unlocked the decoder and you&#8217;re
in.&nbsp; If you have unsuccessfully tried all the 8 possibilities,
then check your layout connection and the loco&#8217;s wheels for poor
connections and try again. Now you say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve looked thru the
list several times and CV 15 doesn&#8217;t appear&#8221;.&nbsp; That&#8217;s on purpose,
to minimize inadvertent locking by a Write All Sheets.&nbsp; You will
have to use the<u> </u><a href="Simple_Programmer.shtml">Single CV Programmer </a>to write CV15.&nbsp; It can be found in the Tools menu on the Main  Page, under Programmers.</p>
<p>If you have more than one decoder in your locomotive, you probably
have a decoder locking scheme implemented to be able to access each one
individually for programming. There is a <a href="Multi_Decoder_Control.shtml">Multi-decoder control</a>
tool in JMRI. It is located on the main window under Tools menu,
programmers option. It is accompanied with a comprehensive help
describing its use.</p>
<p>
You may <b>Read</b> or <b>Write</b> individual CVs using the buttons
in their row. On this page, a <b>Read sheet</b> or <b>Write sheet</b> operation
is the same as a <b>Read all</b> or <b>Write all</b>. <span class="ACCENT">Again, a reminder: you can only read CVs if your command station has that capability.</span>

</p><p>
  One thing to keep in mind about the <b>CV</b> listing on
this pane - anything you can do here you can do from one of the other
panes in Decoder Pro, without having to know the <b>CV</b> number or
how to compile the values to get the desired effect. This pane is meant
for advanced users of DCC used to crunching the numbers themselves.
Those new to DCC can safely ignore this panel without losing any
capability at all.
