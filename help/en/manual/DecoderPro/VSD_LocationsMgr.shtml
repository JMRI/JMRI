<h4>Manage VSD Locations</h4>
<p><span id="product-desc">The <strong>Manage VSD Locations</strong>
window provides a consolidated location to manage and set the apparent
physical location of sounds for trains using Virtual Sound Decoder</span></p>

The <strong>Manage VSD Locations</strong> window has three tabs:
Reporters, Operations Locations, and Listeners.  Each tab shows a list
of objects, each with a check-box to enable/disable use (for VSD
purposes, not for other JMRI purposes), and entry cells for X, Y, and
Z location coordinates.

<h5>Reporters</h5>
<img src="images/VSD_Locations01.png" alt="Manage Reporter Locations" width="560" height="340" border="4">

<p>The Reporters tab shows a list of all currently defined Reporters.
This is intended for use with Digitrax Transponding or other similar
locomotive tracking hardware systems.</p>
<h5>Operations Locations</h5>
<img src="images/VSD_Locations02.png" alt="Manage Operations Locations" width="560" height="340" border="4">
<p>The Operations Locations tab shows a list of all Locations defined
within the JMRI Operations system.</p>
<h5>Listeners</h5>
<img src="images/VSD_Locations03.png" alt="Manage Listener Locations" width="560" height="340" border="4">
<p>The Listeners tab shows the location of the Listener in the VSD sound
system.  The Listener position has two additional measurements: the
Bearing (angle clockwise from the Y axis) and Azimuth (angle up or down from
the X/Y plane) which together describe which way the Listener is
facing.</p>

<a name="VSDLocations"></a><h4>Location Following</h4>
<p>With input from locomotive tracking hardware, Virtual Sound Decoder is
able to move the apparent source of the locomotive sound to follow the
locomotive's position on the layout.
<h5>Location Following Setup</h5>
To enable location following you will need a hardware method of
tracking the locomotive's position on the layout.  VSD currently
supports the following tracking systems:
<ul>
  <li>Digitrax Transponding (tested) </li>
  <li>ESU ECoS (not tested)</li>
  <li>RFID (not tested)</li>
  <li>RPS (not tested)</li>
  <li>RailCom / DCC4PC (not tested)</li>
</ul>

If you have one of the systems noted as "not tested", and would like
to help with testing and debug of this feature, please contact me on
the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">JMRIUsers
Yahoo! Group</a>.  More systems will be added in the future.

To enable VSD Location Following, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Follow the directions appropriate to your hardware system for
  <!-- link below should point to the HELP page for Reporters -->
  <a href="../../html/tools/Reporters.shtml">setting
  up Reporters</a>.</li>
  <li>Select Debug->Virtual Sound Decoder->Manage VSD Locations</li>
  <li>In the dialog, set X / Y / Z coordinates for each reporter you
  wish to use for VSD location following.  Uncheck the "Use Location"
  box for Reporters you do not wish to use for VSD tracking.</li>
  <li>Click "Save" to store the new values.</li>
  <li>Save your configuration either in a config file or as part of a
  Panel</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note:</em> Reporters are not added to the Manage VSD Locations
"live".  If you add new Reporters, you must close and re-open the
Manage VSD Locations window to make the new Reporters appear.</p>

<h5>Coordinate System</h5>

<p>The VSD Locations system uses a standard "right handed"
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian
coordinate system</a>, where a location is defined by a combination of
distances along an X, Y, and Z axis.  The Origin, or center of the
coordinates can be in any convenient location, such as the center of
the room, a corner of the room, or a corner of the layout.</p>

<p>The X / Y / Z location values can be in any unit you choose,
including an arbitrary relative scheme, as long as you are
consistent. By default, positive X is to the space's right, positive Y
is "forward", and positive Z is "up".
Negative values are left, behind, and
down, respectively. Alternately you may prefer to think of +X as
"East", +Y as "North", and +Z as "up".</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The coordinate system can be rotated in any way that
makes sense to the user.  If it suits the railroad's arrangement
better, +Y could be "East", +X "South", and +Z "Up".  It is not
recommended that the Z axis direction be changed however, unless your
operators are accustomed to hanging from the ceiling.</p>

<p>A convenient system for a typical rectangular room-sized layout would be to place the
origin at the near corner to the guest's left as the guest stands in
the entry door, or the "bottom left" corner of the layout's track plan
map, and with Z=0 at the layout's lowest nominal track elevation for
the "live" part of the layout.  This system ensures that all locations
used will have positive X / Y / Z values.</p>

<h5>Listener Location</h5>

<p>If you do not specifically set the Listener location and
orientation, the Listener by default will be at (0, 0, 0) and facing
straight ahead along the +Y axis (bearing 0.0 degrees / azimuth 0.0
degrees). To set a different Listener location and/or orientation, go to the
Listeners tab and set the X / Y / Z coordinates of the Listener's
location.  The coordinates and units must be the same as those used
for the Reporters.</p>
<p>The Bearing and Azimuth values set the orientation of the Listener,
or the direction the Listener is facing.  Bearing is measured
clockwise from the +Y axis.  Azimuth is measured up (or down if
negative) from the X/Y plane.  Both measurements are in units of
degrees of angle.  For example, a Listener standing at the Origin (0,
0, 0) and facing "West" and halfway "up" would have a Bearing of 270
and an Azimuth of +45.</p>

<h5>Using Locations</h5>

<p>When you have followed the above setup steps, launch the VSDecoder Manager
window, create a VSDecoder and run the locomotive.  As your locomotive moves
around the layout, the sound will follow the locomotive's reported
position.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The sound will appear to "jump" from location to
location as the locomotive's reported location changes.  This effect
will be smaller with additional and more closely spaced reporters.

<h5>Location Following using JMRI Operations</h5>
<p>If you do not have a hardware tracking system, you can use the
JMRI Operations feature to enable a rudimentary form of location
following.</p>
<p>To set the Operations locations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select Operations->Settings</li>
  <li>Select Tools->Options</li>
  <li>Check the "Enable physical locations for Virtual Sound Decoder"
  option, and save the changes.</li>
  <li>Create Operations Locations within JMRI Operations</li>
  <li>Launch the Manage VSD Locations window</li>
  <li>Set the locations of the defined Operations Locations.</li>
</ol>
<p>To use Operations for location following, assign the specific locomotive to
the train, then select the train in the locomotive's VSDecoder Options
pane.  When you <em>MOVE</em> the train in Operations, the sound will
move to the next location on the Route.</p>
<p>For more information on Operations, see the JMRI&reg; Operations User's Guide</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Operations Locations following is temporarily
disabled in JMRI 3.1.6 but will be re-enabled in 3.1.7.
