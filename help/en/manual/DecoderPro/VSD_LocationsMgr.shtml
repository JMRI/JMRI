      <h4>Manage VSD Locations</h4>

      <p><span id="product-desc">The <strong>Manage VSD
      Locations</strong> window provides a consolidated location to
      manage and set the apparent physical location of sounds for
      trains using Virtual Sound Decoder</span></p>The
      <strong>Manage VSD Locations</strong> window has three tabs:
      Reporters, Operations Locations, and Listeners. Each tab
      shows a list of objects, each with a check-box to
      enable/disable use (for VSD purposes, not for other JMRI
      purposes), and entry cells for X, Y, and Z location
      coordinates.

      <h5>Reporters</h5><img src="images/VSD_Locations01.png" alt=
      "Manage Reporter Locations" width="536" height="358">

      <p>The Reporters tab shows a list of all currently defined
      Reporters. This is intended for use with Digitrax
      Transponding or other similar locomotive tracking hardware
      systems.</p>


      <h5>Blocks</h5><img src="images/VSD_Locations02.png" alt=
      "Manage Block Locations" width="536" height="358">

      <p>The Blocks tab shows a list of all currently defined
      Blocks. This is intended for use with Digitrax
      Transponding or other similar locomotive tracking hardware
      systems.</p>


      <h5>Operations Locations</h5><img src=
      "images/VSD_Locations03.png" alt=
      "Manage Operations Locations" width="536" height="358">

      <p>The Operations Locations tab shows a list of all Locations
      defined within the JMRI Operations system.</p>

      <h5>Listeners</h5><img src="images/VSD_Locations04.png" alt=
      "Manage Listener Locations" width="536" height="358">

      <p>The Listeners tab shows the location of the Listener in
      the VSD sound system. The Listener position has two
      additional measurements: the Bearing (angle clockwise from
      the Y axis) and Azimuth (angle up or down from the X/Y plane)
      which together describe which way the Listener is
      facing.</p><a name="VSDLocations" id="VSDLocations"></a>

      <h4>Location Following</h4>

      <p>With input from locomotive tracking hardware, Virtual
      Sound Decoder is able to move the apparent source of the
      locomotive sound to follow the locomotive's position on the
      layout.</p>

      <h5>Location Following Setup</h5>To enable location following
      you will need a hardware method of tracking the locomotive's
      position on the layout. VSD currently supports the following
      tracking systems:

      <ul>
        <li>Digitrax Transponding (tested)</li>

        <li>ESU ECoS (not tested)</li>

        <li>RFID (not tested)</li>

        <li>RPS (not tested)</li>

        <li>RailCom / DCC4PC (not tested)</li>
      </ul>If you have one of the systems noted as "not tested",
      and would like to help with testing and debug of this
      feature, please contact me on the <a href=
      "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">
	  JMRIUsers Yahoo! Group</a>. More systems will be added 
	  in the future. To enable VSD Location Following, 
	  follow these steps:

      <ol>
        <li>Follow the directions appropriate to your hardware
        system for 
        <!-- link below should point to the HELP page for Reporters -->
         <a href="../../html/tools/Reporters.shtml">setting up
        Reporters</a>.</li>

        <li>Select Debug-&gt;Virtual Sound Decoder-&gt;Manage VSD
        Locations</li>

        <li>In the dialog, set X / Y / Z coordinates for each
        reporter you wish to use for VSD location following.
        Uncheck the "Use Location" box for Reporters you do not
        wish to use for VSD tracking.</li>

        <li>Click "Save" to store the new values.</li>

        <li>Save your configuration either in a config file or as
        part of a Panel</li>
      </ol>

      <p><em>Note:</em> Reporters are not added to the Manage VSD
      Locations "live". If you add new Reporters, you must close
      and re-open the Manage VSD Locations window to make the new
      Reporters appear.</p>

      <h5>Coordinate System</h5>

      <p>The VSD Locations system uses a standard "right handed"
      <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian
      coordinate system</a>, where a location is defined by a
      combination of distances along an X, Y, and Z axis. The
      Origin, or center of the coordinates can be in any convenient
      location, such as the center of the room, a corner of the
      room, or a corner of the layout.</p>

      <p>The X / Y / Z location values can be in any unit you
      choose, including an arbitrary relative scheme, as long as
      you are consistent. By default, positive X is to the space's
      right, positive Y is "forward", and positive Z is "up".
      Negative values are left, behind, and down, respectively.
      Alternately you may prefer to think of +X as "East", +Y as
      "North", and +Z as "up".</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> The coordinate system can be rotated in any
      way that makes sense to the user. If it suits the railroad's
      arrangement better, +Y could be "East", +X "South", and +Z
      "Up". It is not recommended that the Z axis direction be
      changed however, unless your operators are accustomed to
      hanging from the ceiling.</p>

      <p>A convenient system for a typical rectangular room-sized
      layout would be to place the origin at the near corner to the
      guest's left as the guest stands in the entry door, or the
      "bottom left" corner of the layout's track plan map, and with
      Z=0 at the layout's lowest nominal track elevation for the
      "live" part of the layout. This system ensures that all
      locations used will have positive X / Y / Z values.</p>

      <h5>Listener Location</h5>

      <p>If you do not specifically set the Listener location and
      orientation, the Listener by default will be at (0, 0, 0) and
      facing straight ahead along the +Y axis (bearing 0.0 degrees
      / azimuth 0.0 degrees). To set a different Listener location
      and/or orientation, go to the Listeners tab and set the X / Y
      / Z coordinates of the Listener's location. The coordinates
      and units must be the same as those used for the
      Reporters.</p>

      <p>The Bearing and Azimuth values set the orientation of the
      Listener, or the direction the Listener is facing. Bearing is
      measured clockwise from the +Y axis. Azimuth is measured up
      (or down if negative) from the X/Y plane. Both measurements
      are in units of degrees of angle. For example, a Listener
      standing at the Origin (0, 0, 0) and facing "West" and
      halfway "up" would have a Bearing of 270 and an Azimuth of
      +45.</p>

      <h5>Using Locations</h5>

      <p>When you have followed the above setup steps, launch the
      VSDecoder Manager window, create a VSDecoder and run the
      locomotive. As your locomotive moves around the layout, the
      sound will follow the locomotive's reported position.</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> The sound will appear to "jump" from
      location to location as the locomotive's reported location
      changes. This effect will be smaller with additional and more
      closely spaced reporters.</p>

      <h5>Location Following using JMRI Operations</h5>

      <p>If you do not have a hardware tracking system, you can use
      the JMRI Operations feature to enable a rudimentary form of
      location following.</p>

      <p>To set the Operations locations:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select Operations-&gt;Settings</li>

        <li>Select Tools-&gt;Options</li>

        <li>Check the "Enable physical locations for Virtual Sound
        Decoder" option, and save the changes.</li>

        <li>Create Operations Locations within JMRI Operations</li>

        <li>Launch the Manage VSD Locations window</li>

        <li>Set the locations of the defined Operations
        Locations.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>To use Operations for location following, assign the
      specific locomotive to the train, then select the train in
      the locomotive's VSDecoder Options pane. When you
      <em>MOVE</em> the train in Operations, the sound will move to
      the next location on the Route.</p>

      <p>For more information on Operations, see the JMRI&reg;
      Operations User's Guide</p>
