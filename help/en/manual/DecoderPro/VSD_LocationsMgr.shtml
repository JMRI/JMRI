      <h4>Manage VSD Locations</h4>

      <p><span id="product-desc">The <strong>Manage VSD
      Locations</strong> window provides a consolidated location to
      manage and set the apparent physical location of sounds for
      trains using Virtual Sound Decoder</span>.</p>The
      <strong>Manage VSD Locations</strong> window has four tabs:
      Reporters, Blocks, Operations Locations, and Listeners. Each
      tab shows a list of objects, each with a check-box to
      enable/disable use (for VSD purposes, not for other JMRI
      purposes), and entry cells for X, Y, and Z location
      coordinates.

      <h5>Reporters</h5><img src="images/VSD_Locations01.png" alt=
      "Manage Reporter Locations" width="536" height="358">

      <p>The Reporters tab shows a list of all currently defined
      Reporters. This is intended for use with Digitrax
      Transponding or other similar locomotive tracking hardware
      systems.</p>


      <h5>Blocks</h5><img src="images/VSD_Locations02.png" alt=
      "Manage Block Locations" width="536" height="358">

      <p>The Blocks tab shows a list of all currently defined
      Blocks. This is intended for use with Digitrax
      Transponding or other similar locomotive tracking hardware
      systems.</p>


      <h5>Operations Locations</h5><img src=
      "images/VSD_Locations03.png" alt=
      "Manage Operations Locations" width="536" height="358">

      <p>The Operations Locations tab shows a list of all Locations
      defined within the JMRI Operations system.</p>

      <h5>Listeners</h5><img src="images/VSD_Locations04.png" alt=
      "Manage Listener Locations" width="536" height="358">

      <p>The Listeners tab shows the location of the Listener in
      the VSD sound system. The Listener position has two
      additional measurements: the Bearing (angle clockwise from
      the Y axis) and Azimuth (angle up or down from the X/Y plane)
      which together describe which way the Listener is
      facing.</p><a name="VSDLocations" id="VSDLocations"></a>

      <h4>Location Following</h4>

      <p>With input from locomotive tracking hardware, Virtual
      Sound Decoder is able to move the apparent source of the
      locomotive sound to follow the locomotive's position on the
      layout.</p>

      <h5>Location Following Setup</h5>To enable location following
      you will need a hardware method of tracking the locomotive's
      position on the layout. VSD currently supports the following
      tracking systems:

      <ul>
        <li>Digitrax Transponding (tested)</li>

        <li>ESU ECoS (not tested)</li>

        <li>RFID (not tested)</li>

        <li>RPS (not tested)</li>

        <li>RailCom / DCC4PC (not tested)</li>
      </ul>If you have one of the systems noted as "not tested",
      and would like to help with testing and debug of this
      feature, please contact me on the <a href=
      "https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">
      JMRI users Groups.io group</a>. More systems will be added 
      in the future. To enable VSD Location Following, 
      follow these steps:

      <ol>
        <li>Follow the directions appropriate to your hardware
        system for 
        <!-- link below should point to the HELP page for Reporters -->
         <a href="../../html/tools/Reporters.shtml">setting up
        Reporters</a>.</li>

        <li>Select Debug-&gt;Virtual Sound Decoder-&gt;Manage VSD
        Locations</li>

        <li>In the dialog, set X / Y / Z coordinates for each
        reporter you wish to use for VSD location following.
        Uncheck the "Use Location" box for Reporters you do not
        wish to use for VSD tracking.</li>

        <li>Click "Save" to store the new values.</li>

        <li>Save your configuration either in a config file or as
        part of a Panel</li>
      </ol>

      <p><em>Note:</em> Reporters are not added to the Manage VSD
      Locations "live". If you add new Reporters, you must close
      and re-open the Manage VSD Locations window to make the new
      Reporters appear.</p>

      <h5>Coordinate System</h5>

      <p>The VSD Locations system uses a standard "right handed"
      <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian
      coordinate system</a>, where a location is defined by a
      combination of distances along an X, Y, and Z axis. The
      Origin, or center of the coordinates can be in any convenient
      location, such as the center of the room, a corner of the
      room, or a corner of the layout.</p>

      <p>The X / Y / Z location values can be in any unit you
      choose, including an arbitrary relative scheme, as long as
      you are consistent. By default, positive X is to the space's
      right, positive Y is "forward", and positive Z is "up".
      Negative values are left, behind, and down, respectively.
      Alternately you may prefer to think of +X as "East", +Y as
      "North", and +Z as "up".</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> The coordinate system can be rotated in any
      way that makes sense to the user. If it suits the railroad's
      arrangement better, +Y could be "East", +X "South", and +Z
      "Up". It is not recommended that the Z axis direction be
      changed however, unless your operators are accustomed to
      hanging from the ceiling.</p>

      <p>A convenient system for a typical rectangular room-sized
      layout would be to place the origin at the near corner to the
      guest's left as the guest stands in the entry door, or the
      "bottom left" corner of the layout's track plan map, and with
      Z=0 at the layout's lowest nominal track elevation for the
      "live" part of the layout. This system ensures that all
      locations used will have positive X / Y / Z values.</p>

      <h5>Listener Location</h5>

      <p>If you do not specifically set the Listener location and
      orientation, the Listener by default will be at (0, 0, 0) and
      facing straight ahead along the +Y axis (bearing 0.0 degrees
      / azimuth 0.0 degrees). To set a different Listener location
      and/or orientation, go to the Listeners tab and set the X / Y
      / Z coordinates of the Listener's location. The coordinates
      and units must be the same as those used for the
      Reporters.</p>

      <p>The Bearing and Azimuth values set the orientation of the
      Listener, or the direction the Listener is facing. Bearing is
      measured clockwise from the +Y axis. Azimuth is measured up
      (or down if negative) from the X/Y plane. Both measurements
      are in units of degrees of angle. For example, a Listener
      standing at the Origin (0, 0, 0) and facing "West" and
      halfway "up" would have a Bearing of 270 and an Azimuth of
      +45.</p>

      <h5>Using Locations</h5>

      <p>When you have followed the above setup steps, launch the
      VSDecoder Manager window, create a VSDecoder and run the
      locomotive. As your locomotive moves around the layout, the
      sound will follow the locomotive's reported position.</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> The sound will appear to "jump" from
      location to location as the locomotive's reported location
      changes. This effect will be smaller with additional and more
      closely spaced reporters.</p>

      <h5>Location Following using JMRI Operations</h5>

      <p>If you do not have a hardware tracking system, you can use
      the JMRI Operations feature to enable a rudimentary form of
      location following.</p>

      <p>To set the Operations locations:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select Operations-&gt;Settings</li>

        <li>Select Tools-&gt;Options</li>

        <li>Check the "Enable physical locations for Virtual Sound
        Decoder" option, and save the changes.</li>

        <li>Create Operations Locations within JMRI Operations</li>

        <li>Launch the Manage VSD Locations window</li>

        <li>Set the locations of the defined Operations
        Locations.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>To use Operations for location following, assign the
      specific locomotive to the train, then select the train in
      the locomotive's VSDecoder Options pane. When you
      <em>MOVE</em> the train in Operations, the sound will move to
      the next location on the Route.</p>

      <p>For more information on Operations, see the JMRI&reg;
      Operations User's Guide</p>

      <a name="advanced_location_following" id=
      "advanced_location_following"></a>

      <h4>Advanced Location Following</h4>

      <p>With input from locomotive tracking hardware, Virtual Sound Decoder
      is able to move the apparent source of the locomotive sound to follow
      the locomotive's position on the layout.</p>

      <p>By adding some geometric layout data, the sound will follow the
      locomotives continuously (without a "jump").</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> JMRI Test Release 4.13.2 or newer required.</p>

      <h5>Advanced Location Following Setup</h5>

      <p>A file named VSDGeoData.xml is required, which provides two general
      attributes and some specific attributes for each location.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of a VSDGeoData.xml with one location (geodataset):</p>

      <pre>
        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
        &lt;vsdecoder-geodata xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"&gt;
           &lt;layout-scale>N&lt;/layout-scale&gt;
           &lt;check-time>2000&lt;/check-time&gt;
           &lt;setup&gt;
              &lt;geodataset&gt;
                 &lt;reporter-systemname&gt;LR1&lt;/reporter-systemname&gt;
                 &lt;position&gt;(-1.5, 1.1, 0.0)&lt;/position&gt;
                 &lt;radius&gt;0.0&lt;/radius&gt;
                 &lt;slope&gt;0.0&lt;/slope&gt;
                 &lt;length&gt;3.0&lt;/length&gt;
                 &lt;end-position&gt;(1.5, 1.1, 0.0)&lt;/end-position&gt;
              &lt;/geodataset&gt;
           &lt;/setup&gt;
        &lt;/vsdecoder-geodata&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>The route in this example is defined as a straight line parallel to the X axis, with a length of three meters.</p>

      <p>The general attributes are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>layout scale (default: N)</li>
        <li>check time (interval for calculating a new loco position; minimum: 500, maximum: 5000, default: 2000 milliseconds).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The attributes for each location are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>system name of the Reporter</li>
        <li>position (starting point) of the location</li>
        <li>length of the location in meters</li>
        <li>type of the location (only two types are supported: line or curve)
         <br>
         if the location is from type line, a slope value must be provided and the radius must be 0.0<br>
         if the location is from type curve, a radius value and the circle center
         point (rotate-xpos value, rotate-ypos value) must be provided</li>
        <li>end-position (endpoint) of the location (last location only)
         <br>
         if the loco is running in a circle, the starting point of the first location and the
         endpoint must be identical</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example for curve attributes:</p>

      <pre>
        ...
        &lt;radius&gt;1.18&lt;/radius&gt;
        &lt;rotate-xpos&gt;0.0&lt;/rotate-xpos&gt;
        &lt;rotate-ypos&gt;0.83&lt;/rotate-ypos&gt;
        ...
      </pre>

      <p>The location (geodataset) sequence defined in VSDGeoData.xml describes a route on a layout.
      The described route should go away from the left to the right in forward direction, or in case of a
      circle, in clock-wise forward direction.</p>

      <p>The Advanced Location Following allows up to four locos. Normally only one
      loco can be detected in a tracking section. If you want to run more than one loco, you may create
      a JMRI Route (again, up to four for VSD purposes) and add the Route to a Train. Please 
      choose the predetermined Route names VSDRoute1 (default), VSDRoute2, VSDRoute3 or VSDRoute4.
      On the "Virtual Sound Decoder Manager" window you'll find an "Option" button on each
      VSDecoder. There you can select a JMRI Train and accordingly a Route.
      Please note that you need a setup section in your VSDGeoData.xml for each Route you want to use.
      </p>

      <p>How to run a test with the <b>JMRI LocoNet Simulator</b> (without a connection to your layout):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure a Reporter named "LR1" is available after PanelPro has started (follow the directions
          appropriate to your hardware system for <a href="../../html/tools/Reporters.shtml">setting up
          Reporters</a>)</li>
        <li>Create a XML file named VSDGeoData.xml (take the example mentioned above)
         and store the file to the "Users Files Location" (JMRI\&lt;Railroad Name&gt;)<br>
         <strong><em>Note:</em> Please make sure that there are no leading spaces in the first line of the file!</strong>
        </li> 
        <li>Download the VSD file Class64.vsd from <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/vsdecoder">the web</a></li>
        <li>Make sure your computer's audio system is working</li>
        <li>Launch PanelPro</li>
        <li>Open a JMRI throttle: Tools-&gt;Throttle-&gt;New Throttle-&gt;Address:
         3-&gt;Set</li>
        <li>Add a VSDecoder: Debug-&gt;Virtual Sound Decoder-&gt;VSDecoder
          Manager-&gt;Add Decoder-&gt;Manual-&gt;Address: 3-&gt;Set-&gt;Load
          VSD File-&gt;File name: Class64.vsd-&gt;Select a Profile: Class64-&gt;OK-&gt;Start Engine</li>
        <li>Simulate an incoming Reporter: LocoNet-&gt;Send LocoNet Packet-&gt;Packet:
         d0 20 00 7d 03 00-&gt;Send-&gt;close the window</li>
        <li>Run the loco and hear the sound wandering from the left to the right</li>
      </ol>

      <p><em>Note:</em> If you choose a Diesel VSD file you might want to add a <strong>top-speed</strong>
      element in the config.xml. Please see the config.xml of a Steam VSD file for the syntax and
      the right place.</p>

      <p>During the setting up and test process I recommend to open a JMRI system
      console, which might provide helpful information: Help &gt; System Console.</p>

      <p>You might also enrich the logging information, by adding the line</p>
       <pre>   log4j.category.jmri.jmrit.vsdecoder.VSDGeoFile=DEBUG</pre>
      <p>to the file <strong>default.lcf</strong> as the last line. This file is located in your "Settings Location" (JMRI).</p>

      <p>Once you have a working setup, you can activate an option in your
      VSD configuration file to print the calculated position points describing the
      route of your loco. Please see the "Create XY coordinates output in
      console for a VSDecoder" option
      <a href="VSD_File_and_Config.shtml#xy">for details</a>.</p>
