      <p>Various things can go wrong when JMRI tries to work with
      your DCC command station to program a DCC decoder. This page
      lists the error message that can result, and describes what
      they mean.</p>

      <h4><a href=
      "http://jmri.org/help/en/html/setup/Errors.shtml">JMRI Error
      Codes</a></h4>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>301 - no locomotive detected</strong></dt>

        <dd>The command station has reported that it doesn't see a
        locomotive on the programming track.</dd>

        <dd>
          <p>This can happen if the locomotive isn't making good
          electrical contact or if there's a wiring fault in the
          locomotive.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>302 - programmer busy</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The command station has reported that it's busy doing
          something else, and can't do any programming right now.
          This usually means that some other part of the DCC system
          is doing a programming operation, e.g. a hand-held
          throttle.</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <p>Some DCC systems can't do ops-mode programming
          (programming on the main) while also using the service
          mode programming track, in which case they'll return this
          error message.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>303 - requested not implemented in command
        station</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This means that JMRI has requested the command station
          do something that it doesn't support.</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <p>This is not supposed to happen, as JMRI should disable
          programming modes that the command station can't provide.
          If you do see this message, please report the
          circumstances on the JMRI users Yahoo group (link at
          bottom of page).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>304 - aborted by user</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The user has requested that the read or write
          operation stop early.</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <p>This is considered an error, because the program
          doesn't know whether the decoder actually saw the
          operation complete or not.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>305 - confirm failed</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Some command stations allow you to "confirm" the
          content of a CV, rather that read the value from it. In
          general, this is faster than doing a complete read. If
          the value in the CV doesn't match the expected value,
          this message is issued. It's considered an error because
          if the values don't match, we know that we don't know the
          correct value for the CV contents.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>306 - timeout talking to command
        station</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The program did not hear back from the command station
          when it expected to.</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <p>This is by far the most common error message when
          people first start using JMRI. In that case, it usually
          means that the connection to the command station isn't
          correct. This could be a problem with the cable(s) making
          the connection, or a problem with how the preferences are
          set. Picking the wrong serial port is particularly
          common.</p>

          <p>Once JMRI is working properly, this error may
          occasionally happen due to a transient error. DecoderPro
          generally will retry it successfully in that case.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>307 - Unknown error</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>An error has happened, but JMRI doesn't know enough
          about it to be able to report more detail.</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <p>In general, JMRI is pretty good at deciphering what
          went wrong, and this message isn't very common. If you do
          see this message, please report the circumstances on the
          JMRi users group.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>308 - No acknowledge from
        locomotive</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>At the end of a CV read or write operation, the
          locomotive replies ("acknowledges") to the command
          station using a pulse of current.</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <p>If that pulse isn't seen, some command stations
          provide this error message. It could be due to poor
          electrical connections to the programming track or within
          the locomotive. It could also be that the decoder doesn't
          support readback.</p>

          <p>Some decoders, particularly certain sound decoders,
          draw so much current that the reply pulse isn't detected
          by the command station. In that case, one of the various
          "programming boosters" may solve the problem.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>309 - Short Circuit on Programming
        Track</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The command station has reported seeing a short
          circuit on the programming track. That prevents
          programming operations.</p>

          <p>Check the electrical connections to the programming
          track, and also within the locomotive.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>310 - Sequence Error</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>For some reason, the programming operation ended early
          and the command station returned to normal mode (left
          service mode) before it should have.</p>

          <p>This is an unusual error, which might indicate that
          you've selected the wrong command station type in the
          preferences. Check that. If that's correct and it's still
          happening, ask for help on the JMRI users list.</p>
