      <p>One of the first things you will notice about the expanded
      <strong>Basic Pane</strong> in the Comprehensive Programmer
      is that there are a lot more options than you found in the
      Basic Programmer.</p>

      <p align="center"><img style="width: 816px; height: 492px;"
      alt="extended basic pane" src=
      "images/Extended_Basic_Program_Roster.png"><br></p>

      <p>Select 2 or 4 digit <b>addressing</b> radio button to
      select which mode of addressing you wish to be active</p>

      <p>You can enter locomotive addresses in both the
      <strong>Primary address</strong> and/or the <strong>Extended
      address</strong>. The address of a decoder is the prefix for
      the code it responds to. This is how you are able to run
      multiple locomotives on a single line and keep all their
      speeds and functions independent. Decoders originally could
      have only a two digit address... after all, who could
      possibly need more than 100 locomotives? Some lower-end
      command stations and decoders still use only two digit
      addressing. Newer decoders can have up to a four digit
      address. The "<b>Addressing Mode</b>" option lets you choose
      between two and four digit addresses. The addresses
      themselves are input into the appropriate text boxes. The
      "<b>Extended Addressing</b>" check box turns on and off the 4
      digit address mode. This allows you to have two different
      addresses stored in a decoder, and toggle between the two.
      Great for locomotives with separate decoders for the motor
      and for sound. Exactly how folks are implementing this is
      beyond the scope of this manual.</p>

      <p>Set the <strong>Locomotive direction: normal</strong> or
      <strong>reverse</strong> from the drop-down list. The option
      for <b>Normal direction of movement</b> is important for
      people who model railroads like the NS, who ran diesel
      locomotives long hood forward, or for the person who
      occasionally makes a mistake and hooks the decoder up in
      reverse. It lets you change the direction defined in the
      decoder as "forward" (no disassembling and rewiring).</p>

      <p><strong>FL Location</strong>: Unless your command station
      or decoder can only handle 14 speed steps, you'll find you
      get much finer control of your locomotives by using the
      <strong>28</strong><strong>/128 speed steps</strong> option.
      If you happen to set the decoder to 14 speed steps by
      mistake, and your command station is in 28 step mode, you
      will find that the headlight will turn on an off as you move
      through the speed steps.</p>

      <p><strong>Power Source</strong> <b>Conversion</b> mode
      allows the decoder to run under regular analog DC voltage
      control or DCC commands. If you find that your locomotive is
      "breaking away" and running out of control at high speed on a
      DCC layout, you might want to disable this capability.
      Decoder equipped locomotives tend to run slower when they are
      on a conventional analog layout, and lighting functions will
      be dim or off at low speeds because sufficient voltage is not
      available.</p>

      <p><strong>User ID #1</strong>" and <strong>User ID
      #2</strong> (off to the right} there are two CVs that have
      nothing to do with any function of the decoder. They simply
      provide you with a method of electronically marking your
      equipment. Use these CVs, even though you may have
      custom-painted equipment for your own freelanced railroad -
      it provides one more way to identify your decoders if they
      are removed from the loco.</p>

      <h2>The Read and Write Buttons</h2>

      <p>At the bottom of all the programmer panes you will find
      three rows of buttons, as shown :</p>

      <p align="center"><img style="width: 808px; height: 145px;"
      src="images/Comp_03_Basic.png" alt="bottom of pane"></p>

      <p>The top row operates <span class=
      "ACCENT"><strong>ONLY</strong></span> on the currently
      visible pane. These buttons are:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Read changes on sheet</b> - an "Oops!" button that
        lets you recover data from the decoder if you've changed it
        accidentally on the computer (and don't remember what the
        values were!), but only if you haven't written it yet.</li>

        <li><b>Write changes on sheet</b> - faster than writing all
        the data on the sheet, and ideal for tweaking changes in
        <b>Ops mode</b>, programming on the main track.</li>

        <li><b>Read full sheet</b> - read all data in this pane
        from the decoder.</li>

        <li><b>Write full sheet</b> - writes all data in this pane
        to the decoder.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The second row of buttons performs essentially the same
      functions, but on the <strong>entire range</strong> of CVs
      for the decoder. This allows you to read all CVs, for
      example, or to make a series of changes across several panes,
      and when done then write them all to the decoder. Again, you
      have the option of reading/writing only the changed data, or
      all data.</p>

      <p>Below the two rows of buttons is a text line that shows
      what the current <b>programming mode</b> is, and a
      <b>drop-down list</b> that allows you to change it without
      exiting the programmer. <a href=
      "Basic_Mode.shtml"><strong>click here</strong></a> for
      further information on Programming Modes.</p>

      <p>Finally, the bottom line of the pane is a status bar that
      tells you exactly what the system is doing. It shows
      <strong>idle</strong> in these screen shots because the
      system was not actively programming decoders when they were
      made.</p>
