      <h4>Virtual Sound Decoder</h4>

      <p><span id="product-desc">The Virtual Sound Decoder provides
      a way for those who do not have sound-equipped locomotives
      (or who are not satisfied with the hardware sound decoder
      options in smaller scales) to enjoy throttle-controlled
      locomotive sounds from their computer speakers.</span></p>

      <h4>How it works</h4>

      <p><span id="product-desc">Locomotive sound "Profiles" are
      stored in a file called a "VSD File". When the Virtual Sound
      Decoder ("VSDecoder" or "VSD") is launched, the user chooses
      the desired Profile, and then assigns the VSDecoder an
      address. When the operator then controls the engine by
      pressing function buttons or changing the speed, the Virtual
      Sound Decoder responds just like a hardware sound decoder
      installed in the locomotive would by playing sounds through
      the computer speakers.</span></p>

      <p>An example VSD file is included with the package, 
      more examples are available for download
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/vsdecoder">on the web</a>
      and you can make (and share!) your own.</p>

      <h4>OpenAL Required</h4>

      <p>Virtual Sound Decoder requires that your system have the
      OpenAL audio library installed. OpenAL is included by default
      on the Mac, but must be installed on Windows.</p>

      <p>OpenAL is available free from Creative Labs. You can
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openal.org/downloads/">
      download the installer for your operating system</a> from the
      OpenAL site.</p>

      <p>If you do not have OpenAL installed, Virtual Sound Decoder
      will <i>seem</i> to work, except you will get no sound
      output.</p>

      <p>Please NOTE: OpenAL is a separate project from JMRI and is
      neither maintained nor controlled by the JMRI
      team.</p><a name="quickstart" id="quickstart"></a>

      <h4>Quick Start - How to use Virtual Sound Decoder</h4>

      <p>To get started with Virtual Sound Decoder, follow these
      steps.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Make sure your sound system is working, and (if needed)
        you have installed OpenAL</li>

        <li>Select Debug-&gt;Virtual Sound Decoder-&gt;VSDecoder
        Manager</li>

        <li>With the VSDecoder Manager window selected, click the
        <em>Add Decoder</em> button.</li>

        <li>Configure the new VSDecoder

          <ul>
            <li>Select a loco from the Roster or enter an address
            Manually</li>

            <li>Click <em>Load VSD File</em> and load the
            "example.vsd" file</li>

            <li>Choose a Profile from the Profile combo-box.</li>

            <li>Click <em>OK</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Press the "Engine Start" button.</li>

        <li>Run your train!!</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Each time you <em>Add Decoder</em> a new control panel
      will be added to the Manager window. The buttons on the
      control panel are specific to that VSDecoder.</p>

      <p>In the Configure Dialog, you can save a VSDecoder profile
      selection to a Roster Entry, so that the profile is
      automatically loaded when the locomotive is selected from the
      Roster. Select the Roster entry, choose a Profile, and click
      "Save".</p>

      <p>For more detailed information on the VSDecoder Manager,
      see the <a href="VSD_Manager.shtml">VSDecoder Manager</a>
      User's Guide page.</p><a name="compatibility" id=
      "compatibility"></a>

      <h4>Throttle Compatibility</h4>Virtual Sound Decoder requires
      a throttle that will report speed changes and function button
      presses to JMRI. Currently compatible throttles include:

      <ul>
        <li>JMRI software and web throttles</li>

        <li>Digitrax</li>

        <li>WiThrottle</li>

        <li>EngineDriver</li>

        <li>OpenLCB*</li>

        <li>Lenz XpressNet*</li>

        <li>ESU ECoS*</li>

        <li>NCE : PowerHouse PRO*</li>
      </ul>

      <p>*Support for these systems is expected but not confirmed.
      If you have one of these systems and can confirm that VSD
      responds to throttle changes, please mention this on the
      <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">
	  JMRIUsers Yahoo! Group</a></p>

      <p>Notably missing from this list is the popular NCE PowerCab
      system.</p>

      <p>VSD is <strong>not</strong> compatible with the following
      systems because they do not send throttle information to
      JMRI.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>EasyDCC</li>

        <li>TMCC</li>

        <li>Lenz XPA (phone adapter)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The buttons on the Sounds tab can be used to trigger
      sounds if you are using an incompatible throttle
      system.</p><a name="locations" id="locations"></a><a name=
      "VSDLocations" id="VSDLocations"></a>

      <h4>Location Following</h4>

      <p>(Note: This function will be active starting with test
      release 3.1.5.)</p>

      <p>With input from locomotive tracking hardware, Virtual
      Sound Decoder is able to move the apparent source of the
      locomotive sound to follow the locomotive's position on the
      layout.</p>

      <h5>Location Following Setup</h5>To enable location following
      you will need a hardware method of tracking the locomotive's
      position on the layout. VSD currently supports the following
      tracking systems:

      <ul>
        <li>Digitrax Transponding (tested)</li>

        <li>ESU ECoS (not tested)</li>

        <li>RFID (not tested)</li>

        <li>RPS (not tested)</li>

        <li>RailCom / DCC4PC (not tested)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have one of the systems noted as "not tested", and
      would like to help with testing and debug of this feature,
      please contact me on the <a href=
      "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">JMRIUsers Yahoo!
      Group</a>. More systems will be added in the future.</p>

      <p>For details on setting up Location Following, see the
      <a href="VSD_LocationsMgr.shtml">Manage VSD Locations</a>
      instructions.</p>

      <p>When you have followed the above setup steps, launch a
      VSDecoder window, assign a locomotive and run it. As your
      locomotive moves around the layout, the sound will follow the
      locomotive's reported position.</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> The sound will appear to "jump" from
      location to location as the locomotive's reported location
      changes. This effect will be smaller with additional and more
      closely spaced reporters.</p>

      <h5>Location Following using JMRI Operations</h5>

      <p>If you do not have a hardware tracking system, you can use
      the JMRI Operations feature to enable a rudimentary form of
      location following.</p>

      <p>To set the Operations locations:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select Operations-&gt;Settings</li>

        <li>Select Tools-&gt;Options</li>

        <li>Check the "Enable physical locations for Virtual Sound
        Decoder" option, and save the changes.</li>

        <li>Follow the directions in <a href=
        "VSD_LocationsMgr.shtml">Manage VSD Locations</a> to assign
        locations.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>To use Operations for location following, assign the
      specific locomotive to the train, then select the train in
      the locomotive's VSDecoder Options pane. When you
      <em>MOVE</em> the train in Operations, the sound will move to
      the next location on the Route.</p>

      <p>For more information on Operations, see the JMRI&reg;
      Operating User's Guide.</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> Operations Locations following is
      temporarily disabled in version 3.1.6. It will be re-enabled
      in 3.1.7.</p>

      <h5>Menu Items</h5>

      <h6>File-&gt;Load VSD File</h6>

      <p>Load the Sound Profiles from a VSD File. Profiles loaded
      will be available to any currently running or newly launched
      VSDecoder.</p>

      <h6>Edit-&gt;VSDecoder Preferences</h6>

      <p>Set preferences for VSDecoder operation. See below for
      details.</p><a name="preferences" id="preferences"></a>

      <h4>VSDecoder Preferences</h4>

      <p>The VSDecoder Preferences pane allows the user to change
      various preferences in how the VSDecoder works.</p>

      <p><img src="images/VSD_Preferences.png" width="828" height=
      "222"></p>

      <h5>Auto Start Engine</h5>

      <p>If checked, the Engine sounds will react immediately to
      Throttle changes, without the Engine Start button first
      having to be pressed.</p>

      <h5>Auto-Load VSD File</h5>

      <p>If checked, the VSD File listed in the Default VSD File
      Path field will be automatically loaded on start-up. This can
      save a step for frequently used VSD Files.</p>

      <h5>Cancel / Apply / Save Buttons</h5>

      <p>Choose Cancel to cancel changes to the Preferences</p>

      <p>Choose Apply to apply changes to the Preferences</p>

      <p>Choose Save to save changes to the Preferences</p>
