      <h4>Virtual Sound Decoder</h4>

      <p><span id="product-desc">The Virtual Sound Decoder provides
      a way for those who do not have sound-equipped locomotives
      (or who are not satisfied with the hardware sound decoder
      options in smaller scales) to enjoy throttle-controlled
      locomotive sounds from their computer speakers.</span></p>

      <h4>How it works</h4>

      <p>Locomotive sound "Profiles" are
      stored in a file called a "VSD File". When the Virtual Sound
      Decoder ("VSDecoder" or "VSD") is launched, the user chooses
      the desired Profile, and then assigns the VSDecoder an
      address. When the operator then controls the engine by
      pressing function buttons or changing the speed, the Virtual
      Sound Decoder responds just like a hardware sound decoder
      installed in the locomotive would by playing sounds through
      the computer speakers.</p>

      <p>An example VSD file is included with the package, 
      more examples are available for download
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/vsdecoder">on the web</a>
      and you can make (and share!) your own.</p>

      <p>See <a href="VSD_File_and_Config.shtml">more details</a>
      on the VSD File and its Configuration.</p>

      <h4>OpenAL Required</h4>

      <p>Virtual Sound Decoder requires that your system have the
      OpenAL audio library installed. OpenAL is included by default
      on the Mac, but must be installed on Windows.</p>

      <p>OpenAL is available free from Creative Labs. You can
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openal.org/downloads/">
      download the installer for your operating system</a> from the
      OpenAL site.</p>

      <p>If you do not have OpenAL installed, Virtual Sound Decoder
      will <i>seem</i> to work, except you will get no sound
      output.</p>

      <p>Please NOTE: OpenAL is a separate project from JMRI and is
      neither maintained nor controlled by the JMRI
      team.</p><a name="quickstart" id="quickstart"></a>

      <h4>Quick Start - How to use Virtual Sound Decoder</h4>

      <p>To get started with Virtual Sound Decoder, follow these
      steps.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Make sure your sound system is working, and (if needed)
        you have installed OpenAL</li>

        <li>Select Debug-&gt;Virtual Sound Decoder-&gt;VSDecoder
        Manager</li>

        <li>With the VSDecoder Manager window selected, click the
        <em>Add Decoder</em> button.</li>

        <li>Configure the new VSDecoder

          <ul>
            <li>Select a locomotive from the Roster or enter an address
            Manually</li>

            <li>Click <em>Load VSD File</em> and load the
            "example.vsd" file</li>

            <li>Choose a Profile from the Profile combo-box.</li>

            <li>Click <em>OK</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Press the "Engine Start" button.</li>

        <li>Run your train!!</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Each time you <em>Add Decoder</em> a new control panel
      will be added to the Manager window. The buttons on the
      control panel are specific to that VSDecoder.</p>

      <p>In the Configure Dialog, you can save a VSDecoder File and
      Profile selection to a Roster Entry, so that the VSDecoder is
      automatically loaded when the locomotive is selected from the
      Roster. Select the Roster entry, load a VSD File, choose a
      Profile and click "Save to Roster".</p>

      <p>For more detailed information on the VSDecoder Manager,
      see the <a href="VSD_Manager.shtml">VSDecoder Manager</a>
      User's Guide page.</p>

      <a name="compatibility" id="compatibility"></a>

      <h4>Throttle Compatibility</h4>Virtual Sound Decoder requires
      a throttle that will report speed changes and function button
      presses to JMRI. Currently compatible throttles include:

      <ul>
        <li>JMRI software and web throttles**</li>

        <li>Digitrax</li>

        <li>WiThrottle</li>

        <li>EngineDriver</li>

        <li>OpenLCB*</li>

        <li>Lenz XpressNet*</li>

        <li>ESU ECoS*</li>

        <li>NCE : PowerHouse PRO*</li>
      </ul>

      <p>*Support for these systems is expected but not confirmed.
      If you have one of these systems and can confirm that VSD
      responds to throttle changes, please mention this on the
      <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">
      JMRI users Groups.io group</a></p>

      <p>Notably missing from this list is the popular NCE PowerCab
      system.</p>

      <p>VSD is <strong>not</strong> compatible with the following
      systems because they do not send throttle information to
      JMRI.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>EasyDCC</li>

        <li>TMCC</li>

        <li>Lenz XPA (phone adapter)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The buttons on the Sounds tab can be used to trigger
      sounds if you are using an incompatible throttle
      system.</p><a name="locations" id="locations"></a><a name=
      "VSDLocations" id="VSDLocations"></a>

      <p>**VSD could also be setup to run in a so called "headless" mode. See 
      <a href="VSD_Headless.shtml">more details</a> on this.
      </p>

      <h4>Location Following</h4>

      <p>With input from locomotive tracking hardware, Virtual
      Sound Decoder is able to move the apparent source of the
      locomotive sound to follow the locomotive's position on the
      layout.</p>

      <h5>Location Following Setup</h5>To enable location following
      you will need a hardware method of tracking the locomotive's
      position on the layout. VSD currently supports the following
      tracking systems:

      <ul>
        <li>Digitrax Transponding (tested)</li>

        <li>Occupancy Sensors and JMRI Blocks (tested)</li>

        <li>ESU ECoS (not tested)</li>

        <li>RFID (not tested)</li>

        <li>RPS (not tested)</li>

        <li>RailCom / DCC4PC (not tested)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have one of the systems noted as "not tested", and
      would like to help with testing and debug of this feature,
      please contact me on the <a href=
      "https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRI users Groups.io group</a>.
      More systems will be added in the future.</p>

      <p>When you have setup the location following, launch a
      VSDecoder window, assign a locomotive and run it. As your
      locomotive moves around the layout, the sound will follow the
      locomotive's reported position.</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> The sound will appear to "jump" from
      location to location as the locomotive's reported location
      changes. This effect will be smaller with additional and more
      closely spaced reporters or sensors.</p>

      <h5>Location Following using Occupancy Sensors and JMRI Blocks</h5>

      <p>Since JMRI Test Release 4.21.1 the "Location Following"
      with JMRI Blocks and occupancy sensors is available.<br>
      When you provide a locomotive address as a numeric Block value, then the 
      sound follows the locations as the locomotive moves from
      block to block.<br>
      For more details, see the
      <a href="VSD_LocationsMgr.shtml">Manage VSD Locations</a>
      instructions.</p>

      <h5>Location Following using JMRI Operations</h5>

      <p>If you do not have a hardware tracking system, you can use
      the JMRI Operations feature to enable a rudimentary form of
      location following.</p>

      <p>To set the Operations locations:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select Tools-&gt;Operations-&gt;Locations</li>

        <li>Create Operations Locations within JMRI Operations</li>

        <li>Follow the directions in <a href=
        "VSD_LocationsMgr.shtml">Manage VSD Locations</a> to assign
        locations.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>To use Operations for location following, assign the
      specific locomotive to the train, then select the train in
      the locomotive's VSDecoder Options pane. When you
      <em>MOVE</em> the train in Operations, the sound will move to
      the next location on the Route.</p>

      <p>For more information on Operations, see the JMRI&reg;
      Operating User's Guide.</p>

      <a name="advanced_location_following" id=
      "advanced_location_following"></a>

      <h4>Advanced Location Following</h4>

      <p>Since JMRI Test Release 4.13.2 the "Advanced Location
      Following" is available. The Advanced Location Following
      calculates the position of a locomotive within a location and
      sets the sound position continuously. This lets the sound
      following the locomotive smoothly without a "jump".</p>

      <p>For details on setting up Advanced Location Following,
      see the
      <a href="VSD_LocationsMgr.shtml#advanced_location_following">
      Manage VSD Locations</a> instructions.</p>

      <h5>Menu Items</h5>

      <h6>File-&gt;Load VSD File</h6>

      <p>Load the Sound Profiles from a VSD File. Profiles loaded
      will be available to any currently running or newly launched
      VSDecoder.</p>

      <h6>Edit-&gt;VSDecoder Preferences</h6>

      <p>Set preferences for VSDecoder operation. See below for
      details.</p><a name="preferences" id="preferences"></a>

      <h4>VSDecoder Preferences</h4>

      <p>The VSDecoder Preferences pane allows the user to change
      various preferences in how the VSDecoder works.</p>

      <p><img src="images/VSD_Preferences.png" alt="Preferences window" width="773" height="220"></p>

      <h5>Auto Start Engine</h5>

      <p>If checked, the Engine sounds will react immediately to
      Throttle changes, without the Engine Start button first
      having to be pressed.</p>
      <p><em>Note:</em> Diesel engines normally have a starting-sound. 
      Throttle changes will not be processed until the starting-sound
      has finished.</p>

      <h5>Auto-Load VSD File(s)</h5>
       <a id="auto-load" name="auto-load"></a>

      <p>If checked, the VSDecoder(s) referenced by a Roster Entry in the
      Roster Group "VSD" will be automatically loaded on start-up.</p>

      <p>To reference a VSDecoder perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
         <li>Make sure that the Roster Group "VSD" exists and at least one Roster Entry is associated.</li>
         <li>Navigate to Debug &gt;&gt; Virtual Sound Decoder &gt;&gt; VSDecoder Manager</li>
         <li>Add Decoder</li>
         <li>Select a Roster Entry</li>
         <li>Load a VSD File</li>
         <li>Select the Profile</li>
         <li>Click the "Save to Roster" button and confirm with "Yes"</li>
        </ol>

      <p>Another prerequisite is to add the Action 
      "Start Virtual Sound Decoder Manager" to your JMRI Preferences Start Up.</p>
      <p>The number of Roster Entries for Auto-Loading is limited to four.</p>

      <p><em>Note: </em>A change of the Auto-Load mode only becomes effective
      after a restart of the VSDecoder Manager.</p>

      <a name="throttle-auto-launch" id="throttle-auto-launch"></a>
      <p>JMRI Throttle Auto-Launch Option:<br>
      In addition to or independent to the Auto-Load option for a VSDecoder, you
      can configure a Roster Entry to launch a JMRI Throttle automatically.<br>
      Therefore the attribute "VSDecoder_LaunchThrottle" must be set to "yes"
      in the Roster Entry Media.<br>
      If the attribute does not yet exist, it will be saved with the value "no"
      when you click on "Save to Roster".<br>
      The attribute can be changed manually or by a Jython script (see
      <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/files/VSD/Utilities">here</a>).</p>

      <h5>Default VSD File Path</h5>

      <p>This path is the default path for the "Load VSD File" chooser box.</p>

      <h5>Default VSD File Name</h5>

      <p>Was required for the first version of Auto-Load. Is no longer used.</p>

      <h5>Cancel / Apply / Save Buttons</h5>

      <p>Choose Cancel to cancel changes to the Preferences</p>

      <p>Choose Apply to apply changes to the Preferences</p>

      <p>Choose Save to save changes to the Preferences</p>
