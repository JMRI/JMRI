      <h2>Motor Control Pane</h2>

      <p>Motor control is divided into three separate panes. The
      <strong>Motor Control pane</strong> deals with CV's for
      simulating locomotive weight or inertia. The <a href=
      "Comp_Speed.shtml" target="_parent"><strong>Basic Speed
      Control pane</strong></a><a href="Comp_Basic.shtml" target=
      "_parent"></a> deals with basic motor control CV's and the
      third <a href="Comp_Speed_Talble.shtml" target=
      "_parent"><strong>Speed Table pane</strong></a><a href=
      "Comp_Speed.shtml" target="_parent"></a> covers those dealing
      with the Speed Table method of controlling the motor. These
      last two methods of motor control are mutually exclusive. The
      selection is made with a radio button at the top of each of
      those two panes. The default selection is Basic Speed
      Control.</p>

      <p><strong>The Motor Pane</strong></p>

      <h1><img style="width: 801px; height: 372px;" alt="motor"

      <p>The contents of the Motor pane will vary significantly
      between different brands and models of decoders. In the case
      of the decoder shown in the illustration:</p>

      <p><strong>Acceleration Rate</strong> and
      <strong>Deceleration Rate</strong> help simulate a locomotive
      under load - but don't use them unless you have very clean
      track, because an interruption of power can make a locomotive
      stop and cycle through the acceleration curve again! On the
      latest Tsunami Diesel sound decoders the firmware has been
      changed. The decoder now returns to the last speed setting
      before the power interruption but it has no knowledge of
      where it was in the acceleration curve. So if you have been
      in the habit of using lots of momentum and setting speed to
      maximum to get the sound of a notch 8 motor, be aware that if
      the loco loses power for just an instant from a dirt spot on
      the rails, it will resume at the top speed step and appear to
      be running away.</p>

      <p>High deceleration rates can make station stops and
      switching realistic, but very challenging!</p>

      <p><strong>Back EMF</strong> or <strong>Speed
      stabilization</strong> <strong>(BEMF)</strong>is implemented
      differently by each manufacturer.. See your decoder
      documentation for the best ways to implement these variables,
      and be prepared to do a lot of experimenting! However they do
      it and whatever they call it, you should find it in this
      pane.</p>
