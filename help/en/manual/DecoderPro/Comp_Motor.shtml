      <p>Motor control is divided into three separate panes. The <strong>Motor Control
      pane</strong> deals with CV's for simulating locomotive weight or inertia. The <a href=
      "Comp_Speed.shtml" target="_parent"><strong>Basic Speed Control pane</strong></a><a href=
      "Comp_Basic.shtml" target="_parent"></a> deals with basic motor control CV's and the third
      <a href="Comp_Speed_Talble.shtml" target="_parent"><strong>Speed Table
      pane</strong></a><a href="Comp_Speed.shtml" target="_parent"></a> covers those dealing with
      the Speed Table method of controlling the motor. These last two methods of motor control are
      mutually exclusive. The selection is made with a radio button at the top of each of those two
      panes. The default selection is Basic Speed Control.</p>

      <p><strong>The Motor Pane</strong>
      </p>

      <h1><img style="width: 801px; height: 372px;" alt="motor" src="images/Comp_03_Motor.png"><br>
      </h1>

      <p>The contents of the Motor pane will vary significantly between different brands and models
      of decoders. In the case of the decoder shown in the illustration:</p>

      <p><strong>Acceleration Rate</strong> and <strong>Deceleration Rate</strong> help simulate a
      locomotive under load - but don't use them unless you have very clean track, because an
      interruption of power can make a locomotive stop and cycle through the acceleration curve
      again! On the latest Tsunami Diesel sound decoders the firmware has been changed. The decoder
      now returns to the last speed setting before the power interruption but it has no knowledge
      of where it was in the acceleration curve. So if you have been in the habit of using lots of
      momentum and setting speed to maximum to get the sound of a notch 8 motor, be aware that if
      the loco loses power for just an instant from a dirt spot on the rails, it will resume at the
      top speed step and appear to be running away.</p>

      <p>High deceleration rates can make station stops and switching realistic, but very
      challenging!</p>

      <p><strong>Back EMF</strong> or <strong>Speed stabilization</strong>
      <strong>(BEMF)</strong>is implemented differently by each manufacturer.. See your decoder
      documentation for the best ways to implement these variables, and be prepared to do a lot of
      experimenting! However they do it and whatever they call it, you should find it in this
      pane.</p>
