      <p><strong>Command Monitor</strong>
      </p>

      <p>Opens the <a href="Main_Monitor_Window.shtml">Communications Monitor Window</a> and
      automatically displays the information that is being sent and received on the communications
      link between your computer and your DCC system.</p>

      <p><strong>Send Command</strong>
      </p>

      <p>Opens the <strong>Send</strong> prompt with a text box to enter the NCE Format command
      that you want to send.</p>

      </p>

      <p><strong>Send Macro</strong>
      </p>

      <p>Opens the <strong>Execute NCE Macro</strong> Window which allows you to enter the Macro
      number to be executed. Clicking the <strong>Send</strong> button sends the macro.</p>

      <p class="dp-center"><img src="images/Main_NCE_02.png" alt="NCE Macro Send" width="199"

      </p>

      <p><strong><a id="EditMacro"></a>Edit Macro</strong>
      </p>

      <p>Open the <a href="#EditMacroWin">Edit NCE Macro</a> window.</p>

      <p><strong><a id="Editconsist"></a>Edit Consist</strong>
      </p>

      <p>Opens the <a href="#Consist">Edit NCE Consist</a> window.</p>

      <p><strong>DCC Packet Analyzer</strong>
      </p>

      <p>The DCC packet analyzer entry is software to log data from a hardware device sold by NCE
      which allows the user to observe the packets on the NCE Command Bus, or alternatively
      directly from the track. The latter feature allows the device to look at track packets sent
      from any Command Station that conforms to the NMRA standard (such as Digitrax or Lenz). The
      input signal is interpreted and sent to JMRI through a serial interface. With it the user can
      see speed and function instructions being sent from the Command Station to the decoder</p>

      <p><strong><a id="Clock"></a>Monitor Clock</strong>
      </p>

      <p>Opens the <a href="#ClockMon">NCE Clock Monitor</a> window. When the clock is running as
      clock master mode, the internal clock rate is adjusted to match time with the NCE command
      station clock. The goal is the minute should roll over at the same time for the internal
      clock and ProCab displays.</p>

      <p><strong>Show Cabs</strong>
      </p>

      <p><br>
      Opens a window that displays the cabs currently on the system. This is handy for determining
      the cab number assigned to a throttle that doesn't have a display. Just use "Show Cabs" to
      display the cabs currently on the system. Then plug in the cab in question and use it again
      to see which one is added. If you have a standalone setup bench it's even easier. Cycle the
      power to clear the command station memory. Then plug in the new cab and Show Cabs will
      display its number</p>

      <p><strong>Booster Programming</strong>
      </p>

      <p>Booster Programming is stated to be only for NCE booster testing, and warns that the
      booster must be disconnected from the track before using.</p>

      <h4><a id="EditMacroWin"></a>Edit NCE Macro Window</h4>

      <p>This tool allows you to review, edit and save NCE style macros. It also allows you to
      backup and restore all the NCE command station macros to and from a file. The file format is
      identical to NCE, so you can restore a file that was generated by the NCE backup command. It
      is recommended that you set the baud rate at 9600 when using this tool.</p>

      <h4><a id="Consist"></a>Edit Consist Window</h4>

      <p>This tool allows you to review, edit and save NCE style consists. Also allows you to

      button to set forward or reverse running. The <strong>Type</strong> button toggles between
      <strong>Long</strong> and <strong>Short</strong> address (remember that NCE allows both long
      and short addresses in the range below 128). Click the <strong>Add</strong> button and that
