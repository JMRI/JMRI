      <hr>

      <p>Prior to using the programmer you need to have completed
      the previous section (<a href="Start_DCC.shtml">Getting
      Started</a>), have your computer connected to your command
      station/booster with the required interface device for your
      DCC system, you are now ready to actually program a decoder
      that has been installed in your locomotive.</p>

      <p><br>
      On opening DecoderPro, the main page will be displayed:
      (After preferences are set)</p>

      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/Splash_Screen.png" width="496" height=
        "282" alt="splash">
      </div>

      <p>There are four buttons near the bottom, the first two of
      which are:</p>

      <p><b><a href="Programmer_ServiceMode.shtml"><input type=
      "button" name="button" id="button" value=
      "Service Mode (Programming Track) Programmer"> Service
      Mode</a></b> - With this button you select a programmer to
      program the locomotive(decoder) on the dedicated programming
      track. (Probably because the Locomotive has to be taken to
      the servicing track to be programmed). Not all command
      stations support a dedicated programming track, and some
      brands will shut down the mainline power when in programming
      mode (not pleasant when you have an ops session in
      progress.</p>

      <p><b><a href="Programmer_OpsMode.shtml"><input type="button"
      name="button2" id="button2" value=
      "Operations Mode (Main Track ) Programmer"> Operations
      Mode</a></b> - or <strong>[Programming on the
      main(POM)]</strong>. This lets you program a specific decoder
      on the layout, even while it is operating. However, because
      it addresses a specific decoder address, some decoders will
      not allow you to change the decoder's address using this
      method! Some command stations will only "broadcast"
      programming commands, which can mean every locomotive on the
      layout gets the same programming! The same is true if you try
      to program a loco with address zero (or forget to enter an
      address when you start). If in doubt, check your
      documentation.</p>

      <p><strong><input type="button" name="button3" id="button3"
      value="Help"></strong> - Accesses the help files<br></p>

      <p><input type="button" name="button4" id="button4" value=
      "Quit"> - Exits the program.</p>

      <p>Any additional buttons are added in the <strong><a href=
      "Start_Preferences.shtml">preferences</a></strong>.</p>

      <h2>Additional programmers that are available.</h2>

      <p><a href="Programmer_SingleCV.shtml"><strong>Single CV
      Programmer</strong></a> Lets you program older decoders one
      CV at a time.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "Programmer_Multi_Decoder.shtml"><strong>Multi-Programmer
      Control</strong></a> provides a convenient way to program
      CV's when you have more than one decoder installed in a
      locomotive. For example, if you have separate decoders to
      control the motor and provide sound, and they both use the
      same CV locations, programming one decoder would change the
      settings on the other, usually an undesired feature.</p>

      <p>Now that you have decided on which Programming Mode to
      use, you may continue</p>
