      <p>You will need, a means to connect between your computer and the track on which the
      locomotive rests, that will take serial instructions and generate DCC packets on the rails.
      At a minimum, a command station/booster( your DCC system will probably suffice), an
      additional hardware interface to send commands from your computer to the command station
      (this could be as simple as a serial cable), and a programming track set up according to the
      manufacturer's instructions.</p>

      <p>For some systems, you will also need an additional hardware interface to send the commands
      from your computer to the command station, and from there on to the decoder in the
      locomotive. For a Digitrax system, for example, you will need either the <strong>PR3
      programmer</strong> or a <strong>LocoBuffer</strong>. The <strong>PR1</strong> device from
      Digitrax is a stand-alone programmer and is <span class="ACCENT">not</span> usable with this
      software.</p>

      <p>For those who do not have any DCC hardware yet and are considering purchasing a DCC
      locomotive and want to use DecoderPro to program it consider the SPROG II USB. It has all the
      electronics in one package with enough output to run a locomotive. It comes complete with the
      USB cable, power supply, instructions and JMRI on disk. All you need in addition, is the test
      track.</p>

      <p>You will also need, of course, some locomotives with the decoders installed which you can
      program.</p>
