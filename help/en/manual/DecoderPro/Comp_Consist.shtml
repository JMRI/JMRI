      <p>Consisting is a means to have two or more locomotives
      respond to orders from the command station, and do it
      together in unison. There are a number of terms used to
      describe consisting, and the manufacturers don't agree what
      those terms should be. The NMRA has adopted terminology, so
      that is what will be used in this discussion.</p>

      <p>Address Consisting. You merely set the address of every
      locomotive to be the same, and we can use the Basic
      Programmer pane to do this. Then a DCC instruction sent to a
      locomotive with address XX will cause all the locomotives
      with address XX to respond. It works well for locomotives
      that are always run together, and is portable from one layout
      to the other. The disadvantage is that it's a pain to keep
      re-addressing your locomotives if you don't always run them
      together.</p>

      <p>So, the NMRA came up with two additional means of
      consisting. One is set up in, and remembered by the command
      station, and the other is set in the decoders.</p>

      <p>The NMRA calls the command station based system Basic
      Consisting. The command station keeps a list of all the locos
      in the consist. When an action is needed the command station
      sends an individual packet to every locomotive in the
      consist, which causes them to then act together. Since this
      method is command station based the consist is not portable
      to another system. Also, since it does not need to be
      programmed into the decoders, DecoderPro doesn't need to deal
      with it.</p>

      <p>The NMRA calls the decoder based system Advanced
      Consisting. To implement this system the decoder has to have
      a special memory space (CV19) which is used to store a
      consist address. This type of consisting is portable between
      layouts, since the information that the loco is part of a
      consist, and the address information for that consist is
      carried in the decoder. The disadvantage is that once the
      locomotive is assigned to a consist it will only respond to
      the consist address. If you forget to "break" the consist at
      the end of an operation, you will be puzzled as to why your
      locomotive won't respond to requests for motion, even though
      it will respond to some of the lighting functions.</p>

      <p>DecoderPro utilizes the Consisting Pane to set up NMRA
      Advanced Consists and the response of the locomotive to
      function requests sent to the consist address.</p>

      <p>The Advanced Consist Address is for <strong>EPF</strong>
      (<strong>Extended Packet Format</strong>, as defined by the
      NMRA Recommended Practices for DCC). If the consist address
      is <strong>any value other than zero</strong>, the locomotive
      is considered to be in a consist and will only respond to
      instructions sent to the consist address. Thus we set a short
      address here to create a multiple engine group that will all
      respond to the same address. Think of it as an MU specific
      locomotive address. Since the address is in the same range as
      non-consisted locomotives with short addresses, we need to be
      sure the address is unique on the layout. A way of doing this
      is to use higher end of the short address range starting from
      127 and going down. Most folks working with single
      locomotives with short addresses tend to be using the
      manufacturer's default of 3, or other low values, typically
      for their logging locomotives.</p>

      <p>This Pane also allows one to instruct the decoder what
      effects are to be active when the locomotive is in a consist,
      assuming the decoder is capable of responding appropriately.
      As an example, this allows you to specify if the headlights
      and other lighting functions are to be always off if the
      locomotive is in the middle, or tail end. This can be handy
      if only the "B" unit has sound. You can set it's lights to be
      off in a consist, but it can sound it's horn even though it's
      in the consist.</p>

      <p>If you've had your locomotives on another layout and ran
      them together, but can't get them to run separately on your
      home system, check this to see if it's consist address has
      been set.</p>
