      <p>The JMRI&reg; Throttle may be used on your computer screen
      to replace the vendor throttle that is furnished with your
      DCC system. One or several throttles may be in use at one
      time. The Throttle opens as a floating window that may be
      positioned anywhere on your desktop. Note the Title Bar
      contains the locomotive Roster ID information or the
      Locomotive address.</p>

      src="images/Main_Throttle01.png"></p>

      <p>(color shading added to show functional areas of throttle
      panels)</p>

      <p>The Throttle Window contains <a href=
      "Main_Throttle_menubar.shtml"><strong>Menu Bar</strong></a>,
      <a href=
      "Main_Throttle_toolbar.shtml"><strong>Toolbar</strong></a>
      and three panels which may be enabled or disabled via check
      box in the View menu. Each panel has a title bar with windows
      controls to minimize, maximize and exit: :</p>

      <p style="color: red;"><strong>Warning!!!</strong> Be careful
      with the left hand (minimize) buttons. In Windows, if the
      little guy is clicked it will minimize the panel, which means
      it is no longer visible but the restore button is lost behind
      the rest of the panels. The way to easily get it back, is to
      go into the view menu, uncheck it there, then go back again
      and re-check it. You may also drag the panels out of the way
      to uncover the Maximize icon for a minimized panel.</p>

      <p><a href="Main_Throttle_addressPanel.shtml"><strong>Address
      Panel</strong></a> (green shading) facilitates setting the
      address of the locomotive you wish to control with the
      throttle.</p>

      <p><a href="Main_Throttle_controlPanel.shtml"><strong>Control
      Panel</strong></a> (blue shading) contains the controls for
      applying power to the locomotive that is addressed and
      controlling speed</p>

      <p><a href=
      "Main_Throttle_functionPanel.shtml"><strong>Function
      Panel</strong></a>(yellow shading) contains all the function
      buttons used to control the addressed locomotives functions.
      If function names are assigned to the functions and stored in
      the roster, they will be displayed.</p><span style=
