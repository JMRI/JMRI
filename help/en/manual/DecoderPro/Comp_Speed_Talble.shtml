      <p>The <strong>Speed Table</strong> allows you to fine-tune
      the throttle response of your locomotive. You might opt to
      match all of your locomotives so they run at the same speed
      for the same throttle setting, or you might want to set the
      table up so that your locomotive runs at the actual scale
      speed indicated by the throttle. Or maybe you have someone in
      your operating group that likes to switch the yard at Mach
      2.5, and you want to slow them down a bit. There are a lot of
      ways to use this feature. (This feature may vary by
      manufacturer and decoder series)</p>

      <p>You now have the option of using <strong>Speed
      Table</strong> (this pane) which if selected and written to
      the decoder will replace the <a href=
      "Comp_Speed.shtml"><strong>Basic Speed Control</strong></a>
      to set your locomotive's speed control mode. Which ever one
      you select last and write to your decoder will be the method
      used for speed control. To select the use of speed tables,
      the <strong>Use Table</strong> radio button is selected at
      the top of the pane, and in the case of Soundtraxx and QSI
      decoders, the drop down selection box must be used. See the
      discussion at the end of this section for an example.</p>

      <p>Not all decoders allow speed table programming and some
      are limited to fixed curves, usually selected by a drop-down
      list.</p>

      <p>The default speed table for most decoders is a straight
      line from zero on the left to maximum on the right. The
      <b><input name="button" id="button" value="Force Straight"
      type="button"></b> below the table duplicates that in the
      table..</p>

      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img style=
      "width: 799px; height: 697px;" src=
      "images/Speed_Table_Straight.png" alt="speed table"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Straight Line Speed
      Curve</strong></p>

      <p>As you can see, you have both numbers and sliders to work
      with. Changing either a number or slider will make the other
      change to match it. If you are CV inquisitive, you can use
      the tool tip to advantage. By hovering over any of the
      sliders, the tool tip will reveal the CV to which you are
      pointing .</p>

      <p>The <strong><input name="button2" id="button2" value=
      "Match ends" type="button"></strong> will also result in a
      straight-line graph, but you can offset the beginning and end
      by any amount you wish. The first and last steps are used to
      set to minimum and maximum values for the straight line. The
      function will then draw a straight line between those two end
      points. Below is an example of the result.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Match.png" alt=

      <p>Now if you've used DecoderPro in the past, you're probably
      wondering what those little boxes at the bottom of each
      slider are used for. Well, they're difficult to explain, but
      easy to use. They basically allow you to set a slider to
      control every slider in columns to its left as well as to its
      right. If you click two of the boxes and then move one of
      those sliders you'll see that they are linked to the sliders
      between them. Points to the right never are higher than the
      slider being moved, and the points to the left are never
      lower that the slider being moved. This "always increasing
      left to right" is normally the way the sliders worked, but
      now the ones in between the check are linked. If the slider
      is lowered and then raised the straight line is drawn between
      the column checked to the right and the column that the
      slider is controlling. It's difficult to describe, but try it
      and you'll see.</p>

      <p><br>
      What could that possibly be used for, you ask? Well, many
      decoders (like the Soundtraxx Tsunami in this example) do not
      support V-start, V-mid and V-max. So, if you are trying to
      use the simplified method of speed matching locos, these
      decoders won't support it. Well now you have a way. Check the
      left-hand, right-hand and middle columns. Set the left-hand
      column to V-start, the right-hand to V-max and then slide the
      middle slider up and down until you get the V-mid that you
      want. Now all you have to do is write this speed table to the
      loco and you've accomplished what you wanted to do, but the
      decoder manufacturer didn't provide for.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_SpeedMatch.png" alt=
      "Speed Match" height="527" width="922"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Substitute for Quick Speed
      Matching</strong></p>

      <p align="left">If you want to set up a loco for switching
      you can set a start speed that is the same for the first
      portion of the throttle revolution and lower the top speed
      for use in the yard as shown below:</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Constant.png" alt=
      "Speed Table - Constant Ratio Curve" border="5" height="270"
      width="800"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Switcher Speed Curve</strong></p>

      <p>if you don't desire a strait-line response curve there are
      other options available. The Constant ratio curve gives you a
      response that increases slowly in the low end and rapidly at
      high throttle. This function will also draw the curve between
      preset end points.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Switcher.png" alt="switcher"
      height="335" width="807"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Constant Ratio Curve</strong></p>

      <p>The <b>Log curve</b> reverses this response, giving you a
      logarithmic response curve with high acceleration at low
      speeds, but topping out quickly. It will also draw the curve
      between preset end points.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Log.png" alt="log" height=
      "345" width="851"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Logarithmic Speed
      Curve</strong></p>

      <p align="center"></p>

      <p>The <input name="button3" id="button3" value="Shift left"
      type="button"> moves the entire speed table to the left one
      space with each click on the button. The example below shows
      a linear 0-255 speed table that has been <b>Shifted left</b>
      three times.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_ShiftLeft.png" alt=
      "shift left" height="369" width="840"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Curve Shifted Left</strong></p>

      <p>The <input name="button4" id="button4" value="Shft right"
      type="button"> move the entire speed table to the right one
      space with each click on the button. The example below shows
      a linear 0-255 speed table that has been <b>Shifted right</b>
      three times.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_ShiftRight.png" alt=
      "shift right" height="331" width="824"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Curve Shifted Right</strong></p>

      <p>Of course, you can enter the numbers individually or move
      the sliders one at a time to create your own fully customized
      speed table. To aid you with setting the individual values,
      the slider value is shown at the top of each slider. Also, by
      hovering the mouse at a slider column the number of the CV
      being entered will be revealed.</p>

      <p>One very important thing to remember: <span class=
      "ACCENT"><strong>No matter how pretty your speed table looks,
      it has absolutely no effect on the locomotive unless you
      write it to the decoder!</strong></span></p>

      <p>And this point is especially pertinent with the QSI and
      Soundtraxx Tsunami decoders, because they have a separate
      drop down box like the QSI box below. They require that you
      select the <strong>user defined</strong> speed table entry in
      this box or your table will not be written to the decoder.
      Interestingly, Tsunami puts the selection at the bottom of
      the list making it very easy to miss.</p>
