      <p>The <strong>Multi-Programmer Control</strong> provides a
      convenient way to program CV's when you have more than one
      decoder installed in a locomotive. For example, if you have
      separate decoders to control the motor and provide sound, and
      they both use the same CV locations, programming one decoder
      would change the settings on the other, usually an undesired
      feature.</p>

      <p>This control uses CV15 and CV16 to control writing and
      reading CV values. Prior to installation of the decoders into
      the locomotive, each one would have a separate and specific
      value programmed into CV16</p>

      <p>Recommended values:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>motor decoder value of 1</li>

        <li>sound decoder value of 2</li>

        <li>function only decoder value of 3</li>

        <li>other uses values of 4 thru 7</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Decoders should ship with the value of 0 in both CV15 and
      CV16, You can only perform a read or write operation on the
      decoder if CV15 and CV16 are the same value. In effect, CV16
      is a lock and CV15 is the key. Once the decoder is locked in
      this way, the ONLY CV that can be programmed is CV15 (you do
      need to be able to unlock it).</p>

      <p><br>
      So now you have two decoders with the same address (both of
      them locked) and you want to unlock one of them. The Multi
      Decoder Control is the tool for that.</p>

      <table width="90%" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding=
      "1">
        <tr>
          <td width="41%" align="center" valign="middle"><img src=
          "images/Main_Multi-Decoder_Control.png" alt=
          "Multi-Prorammer" width="260" height="600" border=
          "4"></td>

          <td width="59%" align="left" valign="top">
            <p>If you followed the recommended values we talked
            about above, then you know what the un-lock number is.
            The <strong>ID number</strong> buttons numbered 0 thru
            6 let you select the value to be entered into CV15 that
            will unlock the decoder with the corresponding number
            in its lock (CV16).</p>

            <p>DecoderPro then reads back the value in CV16 to
            confirm that the decoder has successfully unlocked.</p>

            <p>Once you are done with your programming the tool can
            again be used to insert a zero into CV15, thereby
            locking this decoder.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Legacy</strong> button writes a 7 to
            CV15, which is a special case. Many decoders,
            especially older models, do not have this locking
            mechanism present. In some cases, specifically a
            Digitrax FX3 or later decoder and an early SoundTraxx
            decoder, it's possible to emulate the lock using
            sequential writing of the CVs. Clicking the
            <strong>Legacy</strong> button activates this
            procedure. Unfortunately, it's not an entirely reliable
            method.</p>

            <p>But, what if you didn't follow the recommendations?
            The <strong>Search</strong> button sequentially works
            through the possible values and marks values found to
            be present. If you're dealing with a single decoder to
            unlock, than you're home free. If we're talking about
            multiple decoders with the same address we're probably
            going to get more than one value marked. It's up to you
            to figure which is which. One way is by changing the
            address of one and then testing to see what action
            changed with the new address.</p>

            <p><strong>Search</strong> button sequentially works
            through the possible addresses and marking those
            decoder addresses that are found to be present.</p>

            <p><strong>Reset</strong> button looks for possible
            combinations to unlock a decoder that has been
            inadvertently locked. <span class="ACCENT">Only use
            this option if you have just one decoder in the
            locomotive. If you have more than one , it will unlock
            all of them, which may cause confusion
            later.</span></p>

            <p><strong>Init DH163 + SoundTraxx</strong> button
            configures the <strong>Legacy</strong> mode discussed
            above.</p>

            <p>Status message are displayed below the buttons,
            shows <strong>idle</strong> when no action is
            occurring.</p>

            <p>At the bottom of the window you can select the
            Programming Mode. Any mode not supported by your
            command station will be grayed out.</p>

            <p>If you select the <strong>Ops</strong> mode, which
            programs on the main track, you need to enter the
            address of the decoder (locomotive) that you are
            programming. Your DCC system may require you to check
            the <strong>Long address</strong> check box if the
            address is a long address.</p>
