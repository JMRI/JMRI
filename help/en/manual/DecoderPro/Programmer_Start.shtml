      <p>Prior to using the programmer you need to have completed
      the previous section (<a href="Start_DCC.shtml">Getting
      Started</a>), have your computer connected to your command
      station/booster with the required interface device for your
      DCC system, you are now ready to actually program a decoder
      that has been installed in your locomotive.</p>

      <p><br>
      On opening DecoderPro, the main page will be displayed:</p>

      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/Splash_Screen.png" alt="splash" height=
        "308" width="496">
      </div>

      <p>There are four buttons near the bottom, the first one
      which is:</p>

      <p><b><input name="button" id="button" value=
      "Service Mode (Programming Track) Programmer" type="submit">
      <a href="Programmer_ServiceMode.shtml">Service Mode</a>
      (programming track) Programmer</b> -We will start with this
      button to program your locomotive on the dedicated
      programming track. <strong>Note:</strong> not all systems may
      support this option.</p>

      <p><b><input name="button2" id="button2" value=
      "Operations Mode(Main Track) Programmer" type="submit">
      <a href="Programmer_OpsMode.shtml">Operations Mode</a> (Main

      main(POM)</strong>. This lets you program a specific decoder
      on the layout, even while it is operating.</p>

      <p><input name="button3" id="button3" value="Help" type=
      "submit"> - Accesses the help files</p>

      <p><input name="button4" id="button4" value="Quit" type=

      <p><a name="ServiceMode" id="ServiceMode"></a>Click on
      <b><input name="button5" id="button5" value=

      (Programming Track)Programmer Setup</strong> window opens</p>

      <blockquote>

      <p>The first item at the top of the service mode programmer
      pane is a selection for the mode used to program your
      decoders. This is a legacy to the olden times and rather
      technical, but fortunately DecoderPro has matured to the
      point that it is quite good at selecting the best mode for
      you. It uses the selection of command station from your
      Preferences selections, combined with the decoder
      manufacturer and type selections (which we'll get to real
      soon now). Just accept what's there as a good start. And,
      fear not, for each pane in the programmer has a button which
      can be used to change programming mode if you have a problem.
      For further details on programming mode <a href=
      "Basic_Mode.shtml"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>

      <p>Now let's determine the type of decoder that's installed
      in the locomotive that you would like to program.</p>

      <p>The decoder identification is entered by using the
      selections in the middle of the page.</p>

      <p>Since we want to know what type of decoder is in the
      locomotive, we can either look up what was listed when it was
      entered in the roster stored in this computer, or we can ask
      it what it's manufacturer and firmware version are. The first
      is method is <strong><input name="button6" id="button6"
      value="Ident" type="button"> ,</strong></p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style=
      "width: 518px; height: 452px;" alt="ident" src=
      "images/Basic_Ident.png"><br></p>

      <p>The Ident button was clicked and the locomotive was
      located on the programming track, in this case an Athearn N
      Scale FP-45 locomotive with OEM Tsunami Sound decoder which
      is the Roster.</p>

      <p><strong>IDENT</strong> is used to identify a locomotive
      that is already stored in your computer's roster file. You
      can use the drop down arrow to display a listing of
      locomotives in your roster, and then select the desired
      locomotive from the list. An alternative is to be lazy and
      click the <strong><input name="Ident" id="Ident" value=
      "Ident" type="button"></strong> . The program will then query
      the locomotive to get it's address which is linked to the
      roster entry. The DecoderPro roster entry includes the
      decoder type used when it programmed the locomotive. If it
      gets a valid address, but there is no roster entry with that
      address, then you will get an error message.</p>

      <p>and the other is <strong><input name="button7" id=
      "button7" value="Read type from decoder" type="button">
      .</strong> You can use one or the other, but they are
      mutually exclusive.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style=
      "width: 518px; height: 495px;" alt="read type" src=
      "images/Basic_ReadType.png"><br></p>

      <p><strong>READ TYPE</strong> is the other method located in
      the center of the page. If you click on <input name="button8"
      id="button8" value="Read type from decoder" type="button"> ,
      the system will query the decoder to get the manufacturer and
      firmware version number. From this information it will
      highlight all the decoders which are known to match. There
      may be several, usually with differences in the physical
      shape and size to fit in a particular locomotive's shell, or
      a few more "bells and whistles". When confronted with a large
      selection, you can either remove the shell to try to read
      information printed on the decoder itself, or just select one
      of the ones with the fewest letters in the model number.
      (Letters are often used to separate the shape differences
      which have no bearing on the electronic functions of the
      decoder.) Just be aware that some functions that DecoderPro
      allows you to program may not be fully operable.</p>

      <p>As noted above, these methods will work only with command
      stations which are capable of reading back the contents of
      CV's, and the process does take some time. Many lower end
      and/or older systems and decoders do not provide readback
      capability. If the command station cannot read CV's from the
      programming track, you will have to select the decoder
      manually by using the large selection box in the middle of
      the page. With it you can select the manufacturer, family and
      specific model of the decoder. This manual method may be the
      best and fastest way if you know for sure "What's in
      there".</p>

      <p>If you have a decoder that doesn't appear in the listing,
      you may want to check to be sure that you are using the most
      up to date version of DecoderPro, because manufacturers are
      adding models almost faster than the team can enter the new
      decoder definitions into the files. You can choose a
      manufacturer's version which is as close as you can find, or
      if you're only interested in basic programming functions, use
      the NMRA&copy; decoder which is a generic file of the CV's
      contained in their standards.</p>

      <p>The last item on this pane is the Programmer Format entry.
      It is preset by your Preferences entry, but you can select
      other programmers using the drop down arrow. For now use the
      <strong>Basic</strong> programmer, because you won't be able
      to do much damage if you make mistakes. We'll get into the
      other programmers later on.</p>

      <p>Once you have selected a decoder, or DecoderPro has done
      it for you, the <strong><input name="button9" id="button9"
      value="Open Programmer" type="button"></strong> will become
      activated and you'll be able to move on with Service Mode
      Programming.</p>

      <p>When you are on the <strong>Setup Pane</strong> and click
      on the <strong>Open Programmer</strong> button, the selected
      Programmer window will open. All programmers, Basic,
      Comprehensive and Advanced, open to the Roster Entry
      pane.</p>

      <p>Now lets open the <strong><a href=
      "Basic_Start.shtml">Basic Programmer</a></strong>, which is
      now completely set up with a decoder and the Basic programmer
      is selected.</p>
