<hr>

<p>Prior to using the programmer you  need to have completed the previous section (<a href="Start_DCC.shtml">Getting Started</a>),
have your computer connected to your command station/booster with the
required interface device for your DCC system, you are now ready to
actually program a decoder that has been installed in your locomotive.</p>
<p><br>
  On opening DecoderPro, the main  page will be displayed: </p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/Splash_Screen.png" alt="splash" height="308" width="496"></div>
<p>There are four buttons near the  bottom, the first one  which is:</p>
<p><b>
  <input name="button" id="button" value="Service Mode (Programming Track) Programmer" type="submit">
 <a href="Programmer_ServiceMode.shtml">Service Mode</a> (programming track) Programmer</b> -We will start with this button to program your  locomotive on the dedicated programming track. <strong>Note: </strong>not all systems may support this option.</p>
<p><b>
  <input name="button2" id="button2" value="Operations Mode(Main Track) Programmer" type="submit">
  <a href="Programmer_OpsMode.shtml">Operations Mode</a> (Main Track) Programmer</b> - 
  or  <strong>Programming on the main(POM)</strong>.&nbsp; This  lets you program a specific decoder on the layout, even while it is 
  operating.
</p>
<p>
  <input name="button3" id="button3" value="Help" type="submit">
  - Accesses the help files</p>
<p>
  <input name="button4" id="button4" value="Quit" type="submit">
  - Exits the program. 
</p>
<p> <a name="ServiceMode"></a>Click on <b>
  <input name="button5" id="button5" value="Service Mode (Programming Track) Programmer" type="submit">
</b>and the <strong>Service Mode Programmer  (Programming Track)Programmer Setup </strong>window opens </p>
<blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/Set_Up.png" alt="set up" height="452" width="556"></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The first item at the top of the service mode programmer pane is a
selection for the mode used to program your decoders.&nbsp; This is a
legacy to the olden times and rather technical, but fortunately
DecoderPro has matured to the point that it is quite good at selecting
the best mode for you.&nbsp; It uses the selection of command station
from your Preferences selections, combined with the decoder
manufacturer and type selections (which we&#8217;ll get to real soon
now).&nbsp; Just accept what&#8217;s there as a good start.&nbsp; And, fear
not, for each pane in the programmer has a button which can be used to
change programming mode if you have a problem.&nbsp; For further
details on programming mode <a href="Basic_Mode.shtml"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s  determine the type of decoder that&#8217;s  installed in the locomotive that you would like to program. </p>
<p>The decoder identification is entered by using the  selections in the middle of the page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we want to know what type of decoder is in the locomotive, we
can either look up what was listed when it was entered in the roster
stored in this computer, or we can ask it what it&#8217;s manufacturer and
firmware version are.
The first is method is <strong>
<input name="button6" id="button6" value="Ident" type="button">
,</strong> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 518px; height: 452px;" alt="ident" src="images/Basic_Ident.png"><br></p>
<p>The Ident button was clicked and the locomotive was located on the
programming track, in this case an Athearn N Scale FP-45 locomotive
with OEM Tsunami Sound decoder which is the Roster.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT </strong>is used to identify a locomotive that is
already stored in your computer&#8217;s roster file.&nbsp; You can use the
drop down arrow to display a listing of locomotives in your roster, and
then select the desired locomotive from the list.&nbsp; An alternative
is to be lazy and click the<strong>
  <input name="Ident" id="Ident" value="Ident" type="button">
</strong>.&nbsp; The program will then query the locomotive to get it&#8217;s
address which is linked to the roster entry.&nbsp; The Decoder Pro
roster entry includes the decoder type used when it programmed the
locomotive.&nbsp; If it gets a valid address, but there is no roster
entry with that address, then you will get an error message.</p>
<p>and the other is <strong>
  <input name="button7" id="button7" value="Read type from decoder" type="button">
.</strong>&nbsp; You can use one or the other, but  they are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 518px; height: 495px;" alt="read type" src="images/Basic_ReadType.png"><br></p>
<p><strong>READ TYPE </strong>is the other method located in the center of  the page.&nbsp; If you click on 
  <input name="button8" id="button8" value="Read type from decoder" type="button">
, the system will query the decoder to get the manufacturer and
firmware version number.&nbsp; From this information it will highlight
all the decoders which are known to match.&nbsp; There may be several,
usually with differences in the physical shape and size to fit in a
particular locomotive&#8217;s shell, or a few more &#8220;bells and
whistles&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When confronted with a large selection,
you can either remove the shell to try to read information printed on
the decoder itself, or just select one of the ones with the fewest
letters in the model number.&nbsp; (Letters are often used to separate
the shape differences which have no bearing on the electronic functions
of the decoder.)&nbsp;Just be aware that some functions that Decoder
Pro allows you to program may not be fully operable.</p>

<p>As noted above, these methods will work only with command stations
which are capable of reading back the contents of CV&#8217;s, and the process
does take some time.&nbsp;Many lower end and/or older systems and
decoders do not provide readback capability.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the command
station cannot read CV&#8217;s from the programming track, you will have to
select the decoder manually by using the large selection box in the
middle of the page.&nbsp; With it you can select the manufacturer,
family and specific model of the decoder.&nbsp; This manual method may
be the best and fastest way if you know for sure &#8220;What&#8217;s in there&#8221;.</p>

<p>If you have a decoder that doesn&#8217;t appear in the listing, you may
want to check to be sure that you are using the most up to date version
of Decoder Pro, because manufacturers are adding models almost faster
than the team can enter the new decoder definitions into the
files.&nbsp; You can choose a manufacturer's version which is as close
as you can find, or if you&#8217;re only interested in basic programming
functions, use the NMRA&copy; decoder which is a generic file of the CV&#8217;s
contained in their standards.</p>

<p>The last item on this pane is the Programmer Format entry.&nbsp; It
is preset by your Preferences entry, but you can select other
programmers using the drop down arrow. &nbsp;For now use the <strong>Basic </strong>programmer,
because you won&#8217;t be able to do much damage if you make mistakes.&nbsp;
We&#8217;ll get into the other programmers later on.</p>
<p>Once you have  selected a decoder, or Decoder Pro has done it for you, the <strong>
  <input name="button9" id="button9" value="Open Programmer" type="button">
</strong>will become activated and you&#8217;ll be able to move on with Service Mode  Programming.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When you are on the <strong>Setup Pane</strong> and click on the <strong>Open Programmer</strong>
button, the selected Programmer window will open. All programmers,
Basic, Comprehensive and Advanced, open to the Roster Entry pane.</p>

<p>Now lets open the <strong><a href="Basic_Start.shtml">Basic Programmer</a></strong>, which is now completely set-up with a decoder and the Basic  programmer is selected.</p>
