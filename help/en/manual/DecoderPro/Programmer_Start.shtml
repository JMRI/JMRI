      <p>Prior to using the programmer you need to have completed the previous section (<a href=
      "Start_DCC.shtml">Getting Started</a>), have your computer connected to your command
      station/booster with the required interface device for your DCC system, you are now ready to
      actually program a decoder that has been installed in your locomotive.</p>

      <p><br>
      On opening DecoderPro, the main page will be displayed:</p>

      <div class="dp-center"><img src="images/Splash_Screen.png" alt="splash" height="308" width=
      "496">
      </div>

      <p>There are four buttons near the bottom, the first one which is:</p>

      <p><span class="textbutton">Service Mode (Programming Track) Programmer</span> <a id="ServiceMode" href=
      "Programmer_ServiceMode.shtml">Service Mode</a> (programming track) Programmer - We
      will start with this button to program your locomotive on the dedicated programming track.
      and the Service Mode Programmer (Programming Track) Programmer Setup window opens.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> not all systems may support this option.</p>

      <p><span class="textbutton">Operations Mode(Main Track) Programmer</span>
      <a href="Programmer_OpsMode.shtml">Operations Mode</a> (Main Track)
      Programmer - or Programming on the main(POM). This lets you program
      a specific decoder on the layout, even while it is operating.</p>

      <p><span class="textbutton">Help</span> - Accesses the help files</p>

      <p><span class="textbutton">Quit</span> - Exits the program.</p>

      <p><a ></a>Click on <span class="textbutton">Service Mode (Programming Track)
      Programmer</span></p>

      <p>The first item at the top of the service mode programmer pane is a selection for the mode
      used to program your decoders. This is a legacy to the olden times and rather technical, but
      fortunately DecoderPro has matured to the point that it is quite good at selecting the best
      mode for you. It uses the selection of command station from your Preferences selections,
      combined with the decoder manufacturer and type selections (which we'll get to real soon
      now). Just accept what's there as a good start. And, fear not, for each pane in the
      programmer has a button which can be used to change programming mode if you have a problem.
      For further details on programming mode <a href="Basic_Mode.shtml"><strong>click
      here</strong></a>.</p>

      <p>Now let's determine the type of decoder that's installed in the locomotive that you would
      like to program.</p>

      <p>The decoder identification is entered by using the selections in the middle of the
      page.</p>

      <p>Since we want to know what type of decoder is in the locomotive, we can either look up
      what was listed when it was entered in the roster stored in this computer, or we can ask it
      what it's manufacturer and firmware version are. The first is method is <span class="textbutton"
      >Ident</span>.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 518px; height: 452px;" alt="ident" src=
      "images/Basic_Ident.png"><br>
      </p>

      <p>The Ident button was clicked and the locomotive was located on the programming track, in
      this case an Athearn N Scale FP-45 locomotive with OEM Tsunami Sound decoder which is the
      Roster.</p>

      <p><strong>IDENT</strong> is used to identify a locomotive that is already stored in your
      computer's roster file. You can use the drop down arrow to display a listing of locomotives
      in your roster, and then select the desired locomotive from the list. An alternative is to be
      lazy and click the <span class="textbutton">Ident</span> button.
      The program will then query the locomotive to get it's address which is
      linked to the roster entry. The DecoderPro roster entry includes the decoder type used when
      it programmed the locomotive. If it gets a valid address, but there is no roster entry with
      that address, then you will get an error message.</p>

      <p>The other is <span class="textbutton">Read type from decoder</span> .
      You can use one or the other, but they are mutually exclusive.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 518px; height: 495px;" alt="read type" src=
      "images/Basic_ReadType.png"><br>
      </p>

      <p><strong>READ TYPE</strong> is the other method located in the center of the page. If you
      click on <span class="textbutton">Read type from decoder</span> ,
      the system will query the decoder to get the manufacturer and firmware version number. From
      this information it will highlight all the decoders which are known to match. There may be
      several, usually with differences in the physical shape and size to fit in a particular
      locomotive's shell, or a few more "bells and whistles". When confronted with a large
      selection, you can either remove the shell to try to read information printed on the decoder
      itself, or just select one of the ones with the fewest letters in the model number. (Letters
      are often used to separate the shape differences which have no bearing on the electronic
      functions of the decoder.) Just be aware that some functions that DecoderPro allows you to
      program may not be fully operable.</p>

      <p>As noted above, these methods will work only with command stations which are capable of
      reading back the contents of CV's, and the process does take some time. Many lower end and/or
      older systems and decoders do not provide readback capability. If the command station cannot
      read CV's from the programming track, you will have to select the decoder manually by using
      the large selection box in the middle of the page. With it you can select the manufacturer,
      family and specific model of the decoder. This manual method may be the best and fastest way
      if you know for sure "What's in there".</p>

      <p>If you have a decoder that doesn't appear in the listing, you may want to check to be sure
      that you are using the most up to date version of DecoderPro, because manufacturers are
      adding models almost faster than the team can enter the new decoder definitions into the
      files. You can choose a manufacturer's version which is as close as you can find, or if
      you're only interested in basic programming functions, use the NMRA&copy; decoder which is a
      generic file of the CV's contained in their standards.</p>

      <p>The last item on this pane is the Programmer Format entry. It is preset by your
      Preferences entry, but you can select other programmers using the drop down arrow. For now
      use the <strong>Basic</strong> programmer, because you won't be able to do much damage if you
      make mistakes. We'll get into the other programmers later on.</p>

      <p>Once you have selected a decoder, or DecoderPro has done it for you, the
      <span class="textbutton">Open Programmer</span> button
      will become activated and you'll be able to move on with Service Mode Programming.</p>

      <p>When you are on the <strong>Setup Pane</strong> and click on the <strong>Open
      Programmer</strong> button, the selected Programmer window will open. All programmers, Basic,
      Comprehensive and Advanced, open to the Roster Entry pane.</p>

      <p>Now lets open the <strong><a href="Basic_Start.shtml">Basic Programmer</a></strong>, which
      is now completely set up with a decoder and the Basic programmer is selected.</p>
