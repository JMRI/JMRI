      <b>Service Mode (programming track) Programmer</b> - Select
      to program the locomotive on the dedicated programming track.
      (Probably because the Locomotive has to be taken to the
      servicing track to be programmed). Not all command stations
      support a dedicated programming track, and some brands will
      shut down the mainline power when in programming mode (not
      pleasant when you have an ops session in progress.

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Reading your Decoder On the programming
        track:</strong><br>
        <br>
        To obtain information from the decoder on the programming
        track we rely on the ability of the decoder to respond to a
        query, what is known as <strong>Readback.</strong> Most
        decoders cannot talk to send information back to the
        command station. They just respond to instructions, so
        special instructions were developed which allow the Command
        Station to determine the contents of the decoder's
        memories<br>
        <br>
        Basically the decoder is asked a wholeseries of questions
        and when the answer is "yes" it turns on the motor for only
        a very brief time. The command station notices the current
        being drawn and stops asking questions, since it got the
        <strong><em>yes</em></strong> answer to the last question.
        This can take a bit of time since the command station must
        ask all possible values waiting for the
        <strong><em>yes</em></strong> response. You can observe the
        process by looking down at the bottom line of all the panes
        (the status bar) where the word
        <strong><em>idle</em></strong> is normally shown when the
        programmer is inactive. When DecoderPro is working it will
        show you what events are being performed. Sometimes you can
        see the loco jump a bit as the decoder pulses the motor for
        "yes". The computer folks call this an ack (for
        acknowledgement). When the Command Station sends the
        decoder data that is in agreement with what is in the CV of
        the decoder, the decoder will send an ack. If the ack is
        never received the Command Station tells DecoderPro that
        the Decoder did not respond.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Writing to Decoder on the programming
        track:</strong><br>
        <br>
        The CV data is written to ANY and ALL decoders on the
        programming track. When the write has been successful the
        decoder will acknowledge (ack) to the Digital Command
        Station (DCS.) If the ack is not seen by the DCS it says
        the decoder did not respond. (error code 308 in JMRI)</p>

        <p>Click on <b>Service Mode (programming track)
        Programmer</b> and the Service Mode Programmer (Programming
        Track) Setup window opens</p>

        <div align="center">
          <img style="width: 518px; height: 452px;" alt=
          "service mode set up" src="images/Set_Up.png"><br>
        </div>

        <p>The first item at the top of the service mode programmer
        pane is a selection for the mode used to program your
        decoders. This is a legacy to the olden times and rather
        technical, but fortunately DecoderPro has matured to the
        point that it is quite good at selecting the best mode for
        you. It uses the selection of command station from your
        Preferences selections, combined with the decoder
        manufacturer and type selections (which we'll get to real
        soon now). Just accept what's there as a good start. And,
        fear not, for each pane in the programmer has a button
        which can be used to change programming mode if you have a
        problem. For further details on programming mode <a href=
        "Basic_Mode.shtml"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>

        <p>Now let's determine the type of decoder that's installed
        in the locomotive that you would like to program.</p>

        <p>The decoder identification is entered by using the
        selections in the middle of the page.</p>

        <p>Since we want to know what type of decoder is in the
        locomotive, we can either look up what was listed when it
        was entered in the roster stored in this computer, or we
        can ask it what it's manufacturer and firmware version are.
        The first is method is <strong>IDENT,</strong> and the
        other is <strong>READ TYPE.</strong> You can use one or the
        other, but they are mutually exclusive.</p>

        <p><strong>IDENT</strong> is used to identify a locomotive
        that is already stored in your computer's roster file. You
        can use the drop down arrow to display a listing of
        locomotives in your roster, and then select the desired
        locomotive from the list. An alternative is to be lazy and
        click the <strong>IDENT</strong> button. The program will
        then query the locomotive to get it's address which is
        linked to the roster entry. The DecoderPro roster entry
        includes the decoder type used when it programmed the
        locomotive. If it gets a valid address, but there is no
        roster entry with that address, then you will get an error
        message.</p>

        <p><strong>READ TYPE</strong> is the other method located
        in the center of the page. If you click on <strong>Read
        Type From Decoder</strong> button, the system will query
        the decoder to get the manufacturer and firmware version
        number. From this information it will highlight all the
        decoders which are known to match. There may be several,
        usually with differences in the physical shape and size to
        fit in a particular locomotive's shell, or a few more
        "bells and whistles". When confronted with a large
        selection, you can either remove the shell to try to read
        information printed on the decoder itself, or just select
        one of the ones with the fewest letters in the model
        number. (Letters are often used to separate the shape
        differences which have no bearing on the electronic
        functions of the decoder.) Just be aware that some
        functions that DecoderPro allows you to program may not be
        fully operable.</p>

        <p>As noted above, these methods will work only with
        command stations which are capable of reading back the
        contents of CV's, and the process does take some time. Many
        lower end and/or older systems and decoders do not provide
        readback capability. If the command station cannot read
        CV's from the programming track, you will have to select
        the decoder manually by using the large selection box in
        the middle of the page. With it you can select the
        manufacturer, family and specific model of the decoder.
        This manual method may be the best and fastest way if you
        know for sure "What's in there".</p>

        <p>If you have a decoder that doesn't appear in the
        listing, you may want to check to be sure that you are
        using the most up to date version of DecoderPro, because
        manufacturers are adding models almost faster than the team
        can enter the new decoder definitions into the files. You
        can choose a manufacturer's version which is as close as
        you can find, or if you're only interested in basic
        programming functions, use the NMRA decoder which is a
        generic file of the CV's contained in their standards.</p>

        <p>The last item on this pane is the Programmer Format
        entry. It is preset by your Preferences entry, but you can
        select other programmers using the drop down arrow.</p>

        <p>Once you have selected a decoder, or DecoderPro has
        done it for you, the <strong>Open Programmer</strong>
        button will become activated and you'll be able to move on
        with Service Mode Programming.</p>

        <p>When you are on the <strong>Setup Pane</strong> and
        click on the <strong>Open Programmer</strong> button, the
        selected Programmer window will open. All programmers,
        Basic, Comprehensive and Advanced, open to the Roster Entry
        pane.</p>
