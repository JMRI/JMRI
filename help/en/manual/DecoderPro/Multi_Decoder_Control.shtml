      <p>The <strong>Multi-Programmer Control</strong> provides a
      convenient way to program CV's when you have more than one
      decoder installed in a locomotive. For example, if you have
      separate decoders to control the motor and provide sound, and
      they both use the same CV locations, programming one decoder
      would change he settings on the other, usually an undesired
      feature.</p>

      <p>This control uses CV15 and CV16 to control writing and
      reading CV values. Prior to installation of the decoders into
      the locomotive, each one has a specific value programmed into
      CV16</p>

      <p>Recommended values:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>motor decoder value of 1</li>

        <li>sound decoder value of 2</li>

        <li>function only decoder value of 3</li>

        <li>other uses values of 4 thru 7</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Decoders should ship with the value of 0 in both CV15 and
      CV16, You can only perform a read or write operation on the
      decoder if CV15 and CV16 are the same value. In effect, CV16
      is a lock and CV15 is the key.</p>

          <td width="41%" align="center" valign="middle"><img src=

            <p>The <strong>ID number</strong> buttons numbered 0
            thru 6 let you select the value that will unlock the
            decoder with the corresponding number in it's lock
            CV16.</p>

            <p>DecoderPro then reads back the value in CV16 to
            confirm that the decoder has successfully unlocked.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Legacy</strong> button writes a 7 to
            CV15, which is a special case. Many decoders,
            especially older models, do not have this locking
            mechanism present. In some cases, specifically a
            Digitrax FX3 or later decoder and an early SoundTraxx
            decoder, it's possible to emulate the lock using
            sequential writing of the CVs. Clicking the
            <strong>Legacy</strong> button activates this
            procedure. Unfortunately, it's not an entirely reliable
            method.</p>

            <p><strong>Search</strong> button sequentially works
            through the possible addresses and marking those
            decoder addresses that are found to be present.</p>

            <p><strong>Reset</strong> button looks for possible
            combinations to unlock a decoder that has been
            inadvertently locked. <span class="ACCENT">Only use
            this option if you have just one decoder in the
            locomotive. If you have more than one , it will unlock
            all of them, which may cause confusion
            later.</span></p>

            <p><strong>Init DH163 + SoundTraxx</strong> button
            configures the <strong>Legacy</strong> mode discussed
            above.</p>

            <p>Status message are displayed below the buttons,
            shows <strong>idle</strong> when no action is
            occurring.</p>

            <p>At the bottom of the window you can select the
            Programming Mode. Any mode not supported by your
            command station will be grayed out.</p>

            <p>If you select the <strong>Ops</strong> mode, which
            programs on the main track, you meed to enter the
            address of the decoder (locomotive) that you are
            programming. Your DCC system may require you to check
            the <strong>Long address</strong> check box if the
            address is a long address.</p>
