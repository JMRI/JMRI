      <p>The <strong>Multi-Programmer Control</strong> provides a convenient way to program CV's
      when you have more than one decoder installed in a locomotive. For example, if you have
      separate decoders to control the motor and provide sound, and they both use the same CV
      locations, programming one decoder would change he settings on the other, usually an
      undesired feature.</p>

      <p>This control uses CV15 and CV16 to control writing and reading CV values. Prior to
      installation of the decoders into the locomotive, each one has a specific value programmed
      into CV16</p>

      <p>Recommended values:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>motor decoder value of 1</li>

        <li>sound decoder value of 2</li>

        <li>function only decoder value of 3</li>

        <li>other uses values of 4 thru 7</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Decoders should ship with the value of 0 in both CV15 and CV16, You can only perform a
      read or write operation on the decoder if CV15 and CV16 are the same value. In effect, CV16
      is a lock and CV15 is the key.</p>

            <p>The <strong>ID number</strong> buttons numbered 0 thru 6 let you select the value
            that will unlock the decoder with the corresponding number in it's lock CV16.</p>

            <p>DecoderPro then reads back the value in CV16 to confirm that the decoder has
            successfully unlocked.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Legacy</strong> button writes a 7 to CV15, which is a special case. Many
            decoders, especially older models, do not have this locking mechanism present. In some
            cases, specifically a Digitrax FX3 or later decoder and an early SoundTraxx decoder,
            it's possible to emulate the lock using sequential writing of the CVs. Clicking the
            <strong>Legacy</strong> button activates this procedure. Unfortunately, it's not an
            entirely reliable method.</p>

            <p><strong>Search</strong> button sequentially works through the possible addresses and
            marking those decoder addresses that are found to be present.</p>

            <p><strong>Reset</strong> button looks for possible combinations to unlock a decoder
            that has been inadvertently locked. <span class="ACCENT">Only use this option if you
            have just one decoder in the locomotive. If you have more than one , it will unlock all
            of them, which may cause confusion later.</span></p>

            <p><strong>Init DH163 + SoundTraxx</strong> button configures the
            <strong>Legacy</strong> mode discussed above.</p>

            <p>Status message are displayed below the buttons, shows <strong>idle</strong> when no
            action is occurring.</p>

            <p>At the bottom of the window you can select the Programming Mode. Any mode not
            supported by your command station will be grayed out.</p>

            <p>If you select the <strong>Ops</strong> mode, which programs on the main track, you
            meed to enter the address of the decoder (locomotive) that you are programming. Your
            DCC system may require you to check the <strong>Long address</strong> check box if the
            address is a long address.</p>
