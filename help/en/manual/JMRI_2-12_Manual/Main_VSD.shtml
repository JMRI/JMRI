<hr>
<h4>Virtual Sound Decoder</h4>
<p><span id="product-desc">The Virtual Sound Decoder provides a way
for those who do not have sound-equipped locomotives (or who are not
satisfied with the hardware sound decoder options in smaller scales)
to enjoy throttle-controlled locomotive sounds from their computer
speakers.</span></p>
<h4>How it works</h4>
<p><span id="product-desc">Locomotive sound "Profiles" are stored in a file
called a "VSD File".  When the Virtual Sound Decoder ("VSDecoder" or
"VSD") is launched, the user chooses the desired Profile, and then
assigns the Decoder an address.  When the operator then controls the engine by
pressing function buttons or changing the speed, the Virtual Sound
Decoder responds just like a hardware sound decoder installed in the
locomotive would by playing sounds through the computer
speakers.</span></p>
<h4>OpenAL Required</h4>
<p>Virtual Sound Decoder requires that your system have the OpenAL
audio system installed.  OpenAL is available free from Creative Labs.
You can <a href="http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/Forms/AllItems.aspx">download the installer for your operating system</a> from the
OpenAL site.</p>
<p>If you do not have OpenAL installed, Virtual Sound Decoder will
<i>seem</i> to work, except you will get no sound output.</p>
<p>Please NOTE:  OpenAL is a separate project from JMRI and is neither
maintained nor controlled by the JMRI team.</p>
<h4>Virtual Sound Decoder dialog</h4>
<p>The Virtual Sound Decoder dialog is launched from the Debug menu.
It provides several tabs that allow you to configure and control your
locomotive sounds.  Each VSDecoder dialog represents and controls
sounds for a single locomotive.  Multiple dialogs can be launched to
provide sound for multiple locomotives.</p>

<h5>Menu Items</h5>
<h6>Load VSD File</h6>
<p>Load the Sound Profiles from a VSD File.  Profiles loaded will be
available to any currently running or newly launched VSDecoder.</p>
<h6>VSDecoder Preferences</h6>
<p>Set preferences for VSDecoder operation.  See below for details.</p>
<h5>Volume / Mute control</h5>
<p>At the bottom of the window is a master volume slider and mute
button.  These control the overall sound level for this locomotive,
and affect all sounds generated by this VSDecoder window.</p>

<h5>Config Tab</h5>
<p><img src="images/vsdecoder/config_pane.png" alt="configuration tab"
width="350" height="260" border="4"></p>
<p>The Config tab allows you to select a Sound Profile and assign it
to a locomotive.</p>
<h6>Profile ComboBox</h6>
<p>The Profile ComboBox allows you to select one of the currently loaded
Sound Profiles.  If the box is empty, use the Load VSD File menu item
(or select a Roster Entry - see below) to load a profile.</p>
<h6>Address Select</h6>
<p>Use the text box and short/long chooser to set the DCC decoder address
for this VSDecoder.  This number should match the DCC decoder address
of the locomotive you want the sounds to follow.  Press "Set" to
assign the address.</p>
<h6>Roster Select and Save</h6>
<p> The Roster chooser allows you to select a locomotive from your
Roster.  The DCC Decoder Address will be automatically set to match
the Roster entry. If you have previously saved a VSDecoder profile to that
Roster entry (see below), this profile will also be automatically
set.</p>
<p>Click the "Save" button to store the currently selected Profile to
the currently selected Roster entry.  The next time this Roster entry
is selected, the Profile will be automatically loaded and set.</p>
<p>WARNING: There is a bug here.  The "Save" button does NOT save the
Roster entry change to disk.  You will have to Edit the Roster entry
(from the top-level "Roster->Edit..." menu item) and Save the Roster
entry for the changes to persist after you close DecoderPro.</p>

<h5>Options Tab</h5>
<p><img src="images/vsdecoder/options_pane.png" alt="options tab"
width="350" height="260" border="4"></p>
<p>The Options tab allows the user to select various options for the
selected Profile.  For example, a particular Profile may allow a
choice of several different horn sounds, or turbo/non-turbo versions
of an engine.  Selections here will vary depending on the chosen
Profile.</p>

<p>At this time, these features are not available, so the selectors shown
are for demonstration only - they are non-functional.</p>

<h6>Operations Train Selector</h6>
<p>The one <i>functional</i> selector on this page allows the user to
choose a Train to follow from the JMRI Operations feature.  The
VSDecoder will then use physical location information set for each of
the Locations the Train visits to change the apparent source location
of the engine sounds.</p>
<p>This feature provides a very basic, crude method of providing some
location following of the sound.</p>
<p>To set the locations, open the Locations Table by selecting
"Operations->Locations" from the main window, and then choose
"Tools->Set Physical Locations".</p>
<p> The "origin" (0,0,0) is the listener's position.  +X is to the
listener's right, +Y is directly in front of the listener, and +Z is
up.  Units are arbitrary but must be consistent.</p>

<h5>Sounds Tab</h5>
<p><img src="images/vsdecoder/sounds_pane.png" alt="sounds tab"
width="350" height="260" border="4"></p>
<p>The Sounds tab provides a series of buttons that allow the user to
directly play the available sounds from the computer screen, without
using a Throttle.  The buttons shown vary depending on the available
sounds in the selected Profile.</p>
<h6>Engine Start Button and Slider</h6>
<p>To start the Engine, press the "Engine Start" button.  This will
cause a start-up sound to be played, and then will enable the Engine
sound to follow the Throttle setting for the selected locomotive.
Pressing the Engine Start button again will play a shut-down sound to
be played and silence the engine.</p>
<p>By default, the Engine sounds will not play until the Engine Start
button has been pressed.  If you prefer Engine sounds to play as soon
as the Throttle is changed, this feature can be disabled via the
VSDecoder Preferences.</p>
<p>The slider just above the Engine Start button is an indicator of
which "notch" the Engine is in.  The slider does not control
anything.  Just as on the prototype, the slider (and the engine
sound!) follows the Throttle setting, not the actual locomotive
speed.</p>

<h4>VSDecoder Preferences</h4>
<p>The VSDecoder Preferences pane allows the user to change various
preferences in how the VSDecoder works.</p>
<h5>Auto Start Engine</h5>
<p>If checked, the Engine sounds will react immediately to Throttle
changes, without the Engine Start button first having to be
pressed.</p>
<h5>Auto-Load VSD File</h5>
<p>If checked, the VSD File listed in the Default VSD File Path field
will be automatically loaded on start-up.  This can save a step for
frequently used VSD Files.</p>
<h5>Listener Position</h5>
These entries allow the Listener Position to be set relative to the
user-chosen Origin of the sound field.
<i>Bug Note:  The current implementation of the underlying audio system forces the listener position
to be (0,0,0), so this preference is non-functional.</i>
<h5> Cancel / Apply / Save Buttons</h5>
<p> Choose Cancel to cancel changes to the Preferences</p>
<p> Choose Apply to apply changes to the Preferences</p>
<p> Choose Save to save changes to the Preferences</p>
