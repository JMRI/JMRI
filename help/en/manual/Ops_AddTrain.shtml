<h4>Building Multiple Trains for a Session</h4>
<p>Most operating sessions require more than one train to keep your  operators busy. The correct way to do this is to build and print all of  the trains needed before terminating them. So if you need a dozen trains  for a session, you must build twelve trains before you terminate any one  train. Terminating a train tells the program that the engines and cars  in that particular train have been delivered to their final locations  and can be used again when building new trains. So always build all,  print all, THEN terminate each train after completing its run! It is  okay to build all trains, print all train, and then use the 
  <input type="submit" name="button37" id="button38" value="Save Builds">
  and shut down the program. Later you can restart the  program and terminate the trains that completed their runs.
</p>
<p>The correct time to terminate a train is when the train actually  arrives at its destination. Terminating a train before it completes it  run means that the operation database believes that the engines and cars  have been delivered. It is better to build and print twelve trains and  then later find out that only nine trains completed their runs. You  would then terminate nine trains, and leave the other three for next  time. Or if you wish you could reset any trains that didn't depart from  their terminal. Reseting trains really isn't necessary, the trains that  didn't run during this session could run the during the next session. </p>
<p>An alternate method is to build, print, and use the 
  <input type="submit" name="button39" id="button39" value="Move">
for each train to track the actual movement of the trains during your  session. As long as the trains on your layout match the locations in the  program you can build a new train. </p>
<h4>Moving Trains</h4>
<p>After providing your operators with a printed manifest or location  switch list, you must keep the program database synchronized with the  actual movement of trains on your layout. This is done by the 
  <input type="submit" name="button38" id="button40" value="Move">
located on the far right of the train menu. Pressing the 
<input type="submit" name="button40" id="button41" value="Move">
will cause the train to depart its current location move to the  next location in the route. The engines and cars assigned to the train  will travel to the next location on the railroad. At each location, cars  can be picked up or dropped off. You can also move a train by selecting  the train's icon and selecting 
<input type="submit" name="button41" id="button42" value="Move">
from the icon's popup menu. Each  press of the 
<input type="submit" name="button42" id="button43" value="Move">
moves the train closer to its terminal  location. When the train arrives at the last location in the route, the  last press of the 
<input type="submit" name="button43" id="button44" value="Move">
will terminate the train. Once a train  is terminated, you can build it again. </p>
<p>Each time an engine or car is moved a count associated with them  is incremented. The program uses this to determine which cars haven't  moved recently and tries to select cars with the least number of moves  when building new trains. Each time a location has a car picked up or  dropped, the program increments a count associated with that location.  The program tries to move cars to locations that have experienced the  least number of car operations.</p>
