<p align="left">Add<a href="Ops_Locations.shtml"> Location as Yards</a> and the <strong>Add Location </strong>window for Yards is opened from Add Location window. </p>
<p align="left"><br>
  To add a location as a Yard: in the <strong>Add Location</strong> window, type the<strong> Name</strong>
  <input type="text" name="textfield" id="textfield">
of the Yard location, note most of the window is greyed out until the location is added. The location name must be unique; the program  will not allow two locations with identical names. However, if you want  more than one location to have the same name for your manifests and  switch lists, add a hyphen and a number to the locations name. For  example, "Boston-1" and "Boston-2" will print as "Boston". The program  will remove the hyphen and number when printing manifests and switch  lists.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Operations at this location</strong>
  <input name="radio" type="radio" id="radio" value="radio" checked>
  <strong>Yards</strong>, then press the
  <input type="submit" name="button" id="button" value="Add Location">
at the bottom of the window.</p>

<p>A <strong>classification yard </strong>(US and Canada) or <strong>marshalling yard</strong> (UK and Canada)(including <strong>hump yards</strong>) is a railroad yard found at some freight stations, used to separate railroad cars on to one of several tracks. First the cars are taken to a track, sometimes called a <strong>lead</strong> or a <strong>drill</strong>. From there the cars are sent through a series of switches called a <strong>ladder</strong> onto the classification tracks. Larger yards tend to put the lead on an artificially built hill called a <strong>hump</strong> to use the force of gravity to propel the cars through the ladder.</p>
<p>Freight trains that consist of isolated cars must be made into  trains and divided according to their destinations. Thus the cars must  be shunted several times along their route in contrast to a unit train, which carries, for example, automobiles from the plant to a port or coal from a mine to the power plant.  This shunting is done partly at the starting and final destinations and  partly (for long-distance-hauling) in classification yards.</p>
<p align="left">A yard will contain several tracks that must be defined. </p>
<p>Now after selecting all of the options for the yard, click on 
  <input type="button" name="button2" id="button2" value="Add Yard Track">
