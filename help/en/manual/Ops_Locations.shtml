<p>The Operations Tool, Locations opens the Locations window as shown. Locations are places on your railroad that trains visit to pickup or  drop off cars and engines. Locations can be cities, towns, or just  places where trains need to work cars. To enter a new location press 
  <input type="submit" name="button9" id="button9" value="Add">
, which will open the <strong>Add  Location </strong>window which we will discuss in a moment.&nbsp; But first let&rsquo;s discuss the &ldquo;Locations&rdquo;  window itself. </p>

<p><strong>Name</strong>
  <input type="text" name="textfield" id="textfield">
  The location name must be unique; the program  will not allow two locations with identical names. However, if you want  more than one location to have the same name for your manifests and  switch lists, add a hyphen and a number to the locations name. For  example, <strong>Boston-1</strong> and <strong>Boston-2</strong> will print as <strong>Boston</strong>. The program  will remove the hyphen and number when printing manifests and switch  lists.<br>
  <br>
  Press the 
  <input type="submit" name="button2" id="button2" value="Add Location">
at  the bottom of the panel. The various fields that were disabled should  be enabled.</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_AddLocation01.png" width="711" height="684" alt="Add Location"></p>
<p>Each location can have several yard, siding, interchange or  staging tracks. Yards are where cars and engines are placed for  temporary storage. A siding can be an industry or any place where a car  is loaded or unloaded. For a train to service a location, there must be  at least one track for that location. See below how to add tracks to  your location.</p>
<p>The tables show the length of the tracks, the amount of track  that is occupied (Used) by cars and engines, the total number of cars  and engines (Rolling Stock) at each location, the number of cars and  engines that will be picked up (Pickups) by trains, and the number of  cars and engines that will be delivered (Drops) by trains.</p>

  </strong>You can decide which train direction the location can service. For  example, if only south bound trains can access the location select South and deselect the other directions. This can be useful if you  want to only support trailing point switching for a given location. If a  location can support multiple directions then select the ones that are  appropriate.

<strong>Select the  Rolling Stock serviced by this Location</strong>
You can control the rolling stock a location can service. Push the  "Clear All" to deselect all types, or "Select All" to select all types,  then select or deselect the rolling stock you wish the location to  accept. <br>

To add a location, press the "Add ... Track" button. Now enter the name of  the location along with the length of the track in scale feet or in actual  inches. Append a double quote (") to the length when entering actual  inches and the program will convert the length into scale feet. Append  cm if you want to convert from centimeters to meters. Press the "Add  ... Track" button at the bottom of the panel and the disabled fields  should now appear. </p>

<h3>Rolling Stock Serviced</h3>
You can control what type of rolling stock the yard can service. Note  that the yard rolling stock is restricted to the ones that the location  can service. If the rolling stock that you wish doesn't appear for a  yard, confirm that the location's rolling stock types are properly  selected. If the rolling stock type you want doesn't exist for a  location, you will have to create the type using the "Cars" panels, see <a href="Ops_Cars.shtml">Cars</a> below.
<h3>Road Names Serviced</h3>
You can also restrict which roads a yard can service. Select "Accept  Only" if you want to build a list of road names that the yard will  accept. Select "Exclude" if you want to build a list of road names that  you want to exclude from the yard.
<h3>Comment</h3>
You can enter an optional comment for the yard.
<h3>Save Yard Track</h3>
Press the 
<input type="submit" name="button8" id="button8" value="Save Location">
to save your work. The program will create a  file (OperationsLocationRoster.xml) in your JMRI directory in a folder  called "operations". The program will also create a backup file  containing the last settings for all of your locations. <a name="Sidings"></a>
<h3>Add Sidings, Yards, Interchange, or Staging Only(corresponding to the present task)</h3>
