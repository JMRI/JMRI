<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The first action in programming a locomotive with DecoderPro&reg; is to fill out the roster entry screen.</p>

A <b>roster</b> is a  database of all locomotives that your installation
of DecoderPro&reg; has programmed. It includes the information seen in the screen
below:
<div align="center"><img src="images/Basic_Roster.png" width="652" height="601" alt="basic roster"></div>
<p>Most of these fields are self-explanatory.  However, note that the first field (<strong>ID</strong>) becomes the 
file name in the Roster for the locomotive you are programming. Set up a  schema to identify your locomotive to its decoder program. i.e. Mfr, Loco Type, and &nbsp;Address (Kato_SD40-2_5645). Spaces in the ID field will be  changed to underscores (_) when the file is written.&nbsp; In a club environment, often the ID begins  with the owner&rsquo;s name, or  member number. This way the Roster (which is sorted alphabetically) will keep  all of an owner's locomotives listed together. </p>

<p> The <strong>Decoder</strong> <strong>Comment</strong> field is a good place 
  to add the date you purchased the locomotive, price, or  any other information you might 
feel is important to record. </p>

<p>The 
  <input type="submit" name="Save to Roster" id="Save to Roster" value="Save to Roster">
button stores the  current decoder information to  your computer hard drive and folder where your roster file is located. The default storage is the same directory where the program is  installed. </p>
<p>The 
  <input type="submit" name="button" id="button" value="Reset to Defaults">
button can be used to return the Roster file to the condition of a new file for  the type and version of the decoder listed in the roster entry.&nbsp; It does NOT change the values in the roster  file on your hard disk, unless you specifically save it after using this reset  button. It also is not written to the decoder until you specifically select a  write operation.&nbsp; It was included in  DecoderPro so that if you get hopelessly confused in proceeding screen to  screen entering variables, you can return to the manufacturers baseline default  set and start again. </p>
<p><br>
  Most decoders will activate the <strong>Reset Menu</strong> (next to the File menu at  the top of the page).&nbsp; This will reset  the decoder to the manufacturers default settings for all the CVs, or just some  of them if the manufacturer has several reset routines.&nbsp; It does this by writing directly to a CV in  the decoder, if the decoder has that feature, CV8 in the case of Digitrax. All  decoders may not support reset and how they work is manufacturer and decoder  dependent.</p>
<p><br>
  One decoder with a lengthy list  of reset routines is the QSI Revolution decoder, which enables a drop-down list  of options for resetting the decoder as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="images/Factory Reset.png" width="652" height="601" alt="factory reset"></p>
<p>You  will note that the decoder address is shown but grayed out (or blank if this is  a new locomotive in the roster).&nbsp; This  field is automatically filled in by the program and is determined from the  address entered using the <strong>Basic</strong> tab which we will get to shortly.&nbsp; This address is used with the <strong>Ident </strong>function  on the start page if you wish to recall a locomotive that is already in your  roster. </p>

<p><a name="ProgramModes"></a>The Programming mode can be changed by selecting mode from drop-down list<strong>
</strong> at the bottom of the window. To the left of the
Drop-down list 
is the current programming mode that is selected.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/SetProgramMode.png" alt="Set pogram mode dialog" border="5" class="BOXIT">
  
</div>
<p>There are severall <a href="Basic_Mode.shtml"><strong>programming modes</strong></a>. JMRI now selects the best mode for you.  It determines this from the command station type you are using and the decoder model you are attempting to program.  Usually this will be OK. If you find that you are having a problem with programming you may try a different mode.</p>

<p>For most newer decoders, 
stay with <strong>Paged mode</strong> or whichever Direct mode  your Command Station supports. Your 
decoder documentation should let you know if programming  in some other mode is 
necessary... but if you are having problems, experiment.  If a mode is not supported for the selected decoder and system, that option will be grayed out. 
<p>When you make your selection, the programming mode should now display to the left of the drop-down list.</p>

<p>Now that we have the Roster  information all in order, we can continue with programming the decoder. </p>

<p>But, first a let&rsquo;s talk a  bit about Roster management.&nbsp; The Main DecoderPro&reg; window (the one where we selected the programmer) and the initial DecoderPro  &reg;&ldquo;Splash&rdquo; screen have a menu called <strong>Roster.</strong>&nbsp;  When you click on it you get opportunities to modify, print and move  your roster files.&nbsp; Particularly  interesting are<strong> Export/Import </strong>and <strong>Copy</strong>.&nbsp;  Let&rsquo;s say you and a friend have two identical Berkshires, and you desire  to have yours to be set up just like your friends.&nbsp; Now, you could put his loco on your track and  read all the CVs out and then put them in yours, but if he lives on the other  coast that&rsquo;s not practical.&nbsp; So, have him  use DecoderPro&reg; to export his loco file and e-mail it to you.&nbsp; You import it into DecoderPro&reg;, change the  address if you wish and then use that roster entry to program your loco.&nbsp;Similarly you can Copy a roster entry to duplicate one  of your own locomotives into a second roster entry with it&rsquo;s own address.
