  Once you have downloaded the DecoderPro&reg; software and installed it, simply
open the program in the usual manner for your operating system, windows will show icon on desktop.
<p><img src="images/DesktopIcons.png" width="223" height="79" alt="desktop icons"> 
<p>Double click on the icon for the program to open, in this case we will open DecoderPro&reg;
<p>This dialog will appear briefly as the progam is loading.
<p>
  <img src="images/StartDialog.png" width="170" height="167" alt="Start dialog">
<p>You should
  see this or a similar opening screen displayed after program starts:
  
<h1><img src="images/Splash_Screen.png" width="496" height="282" alt="splash"></h1>

<p>
It may take a while for this screen to come up, especially on older
and slower computers. Remember that you are essentially running the program
on a Java emulator over your native operating system software. New computers
can do this fairly quickly, but older ones will feel like they're taking
forever. <strong>Be patient</strong> - it will come up eventually! Even on older computers, once the program is up the response time is quite good.
<p>If this is the first time you have run the program after you installed the software, the <a href="Start_Preferences.shtml">Preferences</a> screen will  come up automatically to allow  you to set up the system for your particular configuration.&nbsp; Also if you change  your system configuration, OR if you have your laptop away from the railroad,  but you want to play with JMRI there is a simulator mode you may want to  try.&nbsp; &nbsp;So click next, and we&rsquo;ll have a look at  preferences.
