      <p>You will need a means to connect between your computer and the track on which the
      locomotive rests, that will take serial instructions and generate DCC packets on the rails.
      At a minimum, a Command Station/Booster (your DCC system will probably suffice), an
      additional hardware interface to send commands from your computer to the command station
      (this could be as simple as a serial cable), and a programming track set up according to the
      manufacturer's instructions.</p>

      <p>For some systems, you will also need an additional hardware interface to send the commands
      from your computer to the Command Station, and from there on to the decoder in the
      locomotive. For a Digitrax system, for example, you will need either the <strong>MS100
      interface</strong>, <strong>PR3 programmer</strong> or a <strong>LocoBuffer</strong>. The
      <strong>PR1</strong> device from Digitrax is a stand-alone programmer and is <span class=
      "ACCENT">not</span> usable with this software.</p>

      <p>For those who do not have any DCC hardware yet and are considering purchasing a DCC
      locomotive and besides OperationsPro want to use DecoderPro to program decoders, consider the
      SPROG II USB. It has all the electronics in one package with enough output to run a
      locomotive. It comes complete with the USB cable, power supply, instructions and JMRI on a
      CD-rom.</p>
