      <p>In short, DCC is Digital Command Control, a system for operating model railroads in a more
      prototypical manner. Each locomotive contains a tiny, specialized controller. These
      controllers (DCC decoders) accept digital commands over a network (the rails) addressed to
      them and interprets them to control the locomotive's speed, direction, lighting effects,
      sound, and other functions. Each decoder responds only to those commands addressed to it. Not
      every decoder will have functions beyond basic throttle commands available. Although there
      are NMRA&reg; standards for the format of communication (allowing the decoders from different
      manufacturers to work on the same railroad), beyond that there is considerable variety in the
      functions supported and the implementation of those functions.</p>

      <p>Although this Manual deals with just OperationsPro, the JMRI&reg; suite of applications also
      contains software to program and run DCC equipped locomotives, turnouts and signals.</p>
