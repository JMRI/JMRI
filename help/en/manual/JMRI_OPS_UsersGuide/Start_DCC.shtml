      <p>In short, DCC is Digital Command Control, a system for
      operating model railroads in a more prototypical manner. Each
      locomotive contains a tiny, specialized controller. These
      controllers (DCC decoders) accept digital commands over a
      network (the rails) addressed to them and interprets them to
      control the locomotive's speed, direction, lighting effects,
      sound, and other functions. Each decoder responds only to
      those commands addressed to it. Not every decoder will have
      functions beyond basic throttle commands available. Although
      there are NMRA&reg; standards for the format of communication
      (allowing the decoders from different manufacturers to work
      on the same railroad), beyond that there is considerable
      variety in the functions supported and the implementation of
      those functions.</p>

      <p>Although this Manual deals with just OperationsPro, the
      JMRI&reg; suite of applications also contains software to
      program and run DCC equipped locomotives, turnouts and
      signals.</p>
