      <p>If you would like to see Cars delivered to a customer's
      siding in a particular sequence, or with a specific Load for
      delivery or shipping, the program allows you to apply a
      (Manifest) <strong>Schedule</strong> to a Spur Track.
      <strong>This is an optional feature and shouldn't be used
      until you become very familiar with how the program generates
      Manifests and Switch Lists.</strong></p>

      <p>A Schedule provides very fine control on the order in
      which specific Cars Types will be delivered to a Spur Track.
      You can also specify the Road name for the type of Car
      delivered. For example, if you wanted two SP boxcars to be
      delivered followed by a tank car loaded with "Oil", you can
      create a Schedule that will make OperationsPro do exactly
      that.</p>

      <p><a name="Schedules" id="Schedules"></a>You can also access
      your Schedules from the <a href=
      "Ops_Locations.shtml">Locations</a> panel Tools menu. The
      Schedules table provides status for each Schedule. Since you
      can assign one Schedule to multiple Spurs Tracks, the table
      also provides additional status info for each of the Tracks
      that use that particular Schedule. The table also allows you
      the edit a Schedule once its been assigned to a Spur
      Track.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src=
      "images/Ops_Schedule07.png" alt="schedule" height="218"
      width="900"></p>

      <h4>Creating a Schedule</h4>

      <p>First open the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href=
      "Ops_Locations.shtml">Locations</a> window.</p>

      <p>Then press <input name="button" id="button" value="Edit"
      type="submit"> in the column to the right of the location
      that you desire to schedule and the <strong>Edit
      Location</strong> window will open.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Schedule02.png" alt="Schedule"
      height="544" width="777"></p>

      <p>To Schedule a location, select <input name="button2" id=
      "button2" value="Edit" type="button"> in the column to the
      right to schedule the specific track at a location, then the
      <strong>Edit (Spur or other type of track) Track</strong>
      window will open.</p>

      <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width=
      "90%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="44%"><input name="schedule" id="schedule"
            src="images/Ops_Schedule03.png" type="image"></td>

            <td align="left" valign="top" width="56%">
              <p>Next to <strong>Optional Schedule</strong>
              <select name="select" id="select">
                </select> on the <strong>Edit Spur Track</strong>
                panel. Press <input name="button3" id="button3"
                value="Edit" type="submit"> should open the
                <strong>Add Schedule</strong> panel.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>If the Schedule already exists, the <strong>Edit Schedule
      for <em>Spur</em> [spur name]</strong> window opens so you
      can modify (or delete) it.<br>
      If no Schedule is selected, then pressing <input name=
      "button8" id="button8" value="Edit" type="button"> opens the
      <strong>Add Schedule for <em>Spur</em> [spur name]</strong>
      pane.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Schedule04.png" alt="Schedule"
      height="281" width="900"></p>

      <p>A Schedule can operate in two modes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sequential, if you want cars in sequence</li>

        <li>Match mode, if you do not care about car order</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Type a <strong>Name</strong> for your Schedule and then
      press <input name="button4" id="button4" value="Add Schedule"
      type="submit"> on the bottom of the panel. Multiple Spur
      Tracks can use the same Schedule as long as the Tracks use
      the same Car types and Roads.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Schedule05.png" alt="Schedule"
      height="281" width="900"></p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Schedule05a.png" alt="Schedule"
      height="281" width="900"></p>

      <p>Now add your first delivery for this Track by selecting a
      Car type <select name="select2" id="select2">
        <option>
          Boxcar
        </option>
      </select> and pressing <input name="button5" id="button5"
      value="Add car type" type="submit"> . A new item of Type
      "Boxcar" should appear in your Schedule list:</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Schedule06.png" alt="Schedule"
      height="281" width="900"></p>

      <p>A Timetable may be specified using drop-down menus.<br>
      If you wish, specify a particular Road for the type of Car
      you entered, or leave the Road field blank if you don't care
      about the Road name.<br>
      You can also specify the Car Load for both Receive and
      Ship.</p><!-- New in version 3.10 -->

      <div style=
      "margin:40px; padding:10px; background-color:#eee;">
        New in v3.10: Random moves

        <p>The Add/Edit Schedule panel has a new "Random" column
        with a menu of 8 items. The default is [Blank] (disabled),
        and there are values between 5 and 50. If you select 5, it
        tells the program to randomly reduce the number of Car
        Moves at this Location by up to 5%. So if you asked for 10
        Moves, you could get 10 or 9 Moves. If you selected 50, you
        could get any number of Moves between 10 and 5. Be sure to
        press "Save Schedule" to save you setting.</p><img src=
        "images/Ops_AddScheduleRandom413.png" alt=
        "Schedule v3.8 with Random column" height="268" width=
        "825">
      </div><!-- End of New -->

      <p>If you want more than one Car of this Type to be delivered
      consecutively, increase the number in the Count field. The
      maximum Count is 10 and the minimum is 1. Repeat selecting
      Car types and pressing <input name="button6" id="button6"
      value="Add car type" type="submit"> until your have a
      delivery Schedule you like. Press <input name="button7" id=
      "button7" value="Save Schedule" type="submit"> and close the
      Add/Edit Schedule panel when you are done.</p>

      <p>Note only Car Types and Roads that are accepted by this
      Spur Track are available. If a Car Type or Road isn't
      available, check the Car Types and Roads set up for this
      <a href="Ops_AddSiding.shtml">Track</a> and <a href=
      "Ops_AddLocations.shtml">Location</a> in the respective
      panes.</p>

      <p>If you want a specific Load for your cars, you can create
      them using the <a href="Ops_CarAttributes.shtml">Edit Car
      Attributes</a> for car <strong>Load</strong>. Each new custom
      Load type is associated with the Car type. For example you
      can have "Screws" for a Boxcar, and "Oil" for a Tankcar.
      OperationsPro will only deliver Cars with a "Schedule Load"
      to a Spur Track that has a matching Schedule that also
      requests that particular Load. However, Cars with a Schedule
      Load can still be placed at Yards, Staging, and Interchange
      Tracks.</p>

      <p>You can optionally use your Staging Tracks to empty cars
      with a "Schedule" load, and you can also <em>create</em>
      "Schedule" loads using staging tracks.</p>
