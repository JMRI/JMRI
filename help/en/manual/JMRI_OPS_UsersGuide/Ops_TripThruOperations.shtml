      <h2>A Trip through Operations</h2>

      <p>Well, now that we've had an overview of OperationsPro,
      let's see if we can make it work. We could sit down and enter
      a whole bunch of information into the Locations, Cars,
      Engines, Routes and Trains screens or do it the easy way and
      use the built-in Demo Railroad. Since this is a training (pun
      intended) exercise, we'll use the Demo files.<br>
      To get the demo files loaded, go to the JMRI main menu and
      click on <strong>Tools</strong>, scroll all the way to the
      bottom to select Operations (or pick the Operations menu if
      set in Operations settings), and slide sideways to select
      Settings. On the Operations Settings screen select the Tools
      menu and then select Load Demo Files. DecoderPro&reg; will
      need to restart.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Ops_Operations01.png"
      width="778" height="608"></p>

      <p align="left">Now go back to the DecoderPro main menu to
      quit and then re-start the program. This will load the Demo
      files. When the program presents the main JMRI screen, click
      on Tools menu, scroll all the way to the bottom to select
      Operations, and it expands to the Operations menu. Select
      Locations which opens and displays the Location window as
      shown below. All of the locations are shown as a list sorted
      by <strong>Name.</strong></p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Ops_Operations02.png"
      width="670" height="245"></p>

      <p align="left">If you select Lakeview and click on the Edit
      box way over on the right of the entry for Lakeview, you'll
      see a screen like that below, Edit Location, showing that
      Lakeview is a staging area that can accommodate almost any
      kind of car. This will be the starting point for our mythical
      trip.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Ops_Operations03.png"
      width="766" height="577" alt="location Edit"></p>

      <p>We will now exit <strong>Edit Location</strong> window
      that describes location Lakeview Staging Area, by clicking
      the window close icon (red X) in the upper right corner of
      the window. Also close the <strong>Locations</strong> window
      in the same manner.</p>

      <p>Now, let's take a look at what resources are available to
      make up our train. Open the Cars window from the Operations
      menu. The Cars window now lists all the cars that are in the
      OperationsPro database and can be chosen to make up a train,
      so many that there's a scrollbar on the right to scroll
      through the list. Again clicking on the Edit box on the right
      we could see the specifics of any one car and of course Edit
      the data (if it was our own). We won't bother.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Ops_Operations04.png"
      width="900" height="486"></p>

      <p>Of course, we'll need Motive Power to pull our train, so
      let's look at what's in the Locomotives Table.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Ops_Operations05.png"
      width="900" height="453"></p>

      <p>Since we know we're departing from
      <strong>Lakeview</strong> we probably want to eyeball that
      pair of <strong>Trainmasters</strong> sitting over on track
      <strong>#97.</strong> The Command Station on our Demo
      railroad is obviously an NCE product because these locos are
      assigned <strong>NCE consist #118.</strong></p>

      <p>So how does Operations REALLY work? Well, once you have
      all the data entered as we've seen above, we can generate a
      set of manifests for the train operations. To do this we use
      the Trains window. Select <strong>Trains</strong> from the
      <strong>Operations</strong> menu and the
      <strong>Trains</strong> window will display.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Ops_Operations06.png"
      width="899" height="358"></p>

      <p>Here there are several trains ready to build. The
      highlighted train is <strong>LBX from Lakeview to
      Bakersfield</strong>. By putting a check mark in the box in
      the Build column and then clicking the <input name="button1"
      id="button1" value="Build" type="button"> button at the
      bottom of the screen we were able to get the manifest built
      so that we can preview it. It's a short run, but still takes
      more than one page of fine print instructions for the
      crew.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Ops_Operations07.png"
      width="900" height="1169"></p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Ops_Operations08.png"
      width="900" height="472"></p>

      <p>We pick up our locomotives in Lakeview and head over to
      the yard to gather up a bunch of cars and a caboose. Then we
      get ready to depart at 7:10 on the fast clock. We should
      arrive at Farmington at 7:14, and since there were no
      Farmington bound cars in Lakeview, and nothing in Farmington
      bound for Hillsboro or Bakersfield, the program has scheduled
      no work to do at Farmington. So we'll keep going. When we
      arrive at Hillsboro (hopefully at 7:18), we have some
      set-outs and pick-ups to attend to. Then, we're off to
      Bakersfield, gliding through Danville and Port Arthur on the
      way. Arriving at Bakersfield right on time at 8:21, we drop
      the boxcar at Heritage Furniture, the Coalhopper in the yard,
      and slide the caboose gently into the caboose track. Now we
      can take the motive power over to the locomotive terminal and
      call in to Dispatch asking for the trip to be terminated.<br>
      The trip is terminated by selecting it in the Trains screen
      and clicking the terminate button. This would then enter the
      new locations of the rolling stock into the data screens and
      release them for the next build.<br>
      So that wasn't so difficult, was it? Hope you enjoyed your
      cab ride.</p>
