              recommended when you are beginning, as Normal builds

              train that there will be track space available for
              the car.</p>

              <p>Aggressive builds makes the car's track space
              available as soon as a car is scheduled for a
              pickup.</p>

              <p>Note that once you've built a train, the build
              option can not be changed until all trains are
