      <h3>Switch Lists by Location</h3>

      <p>A Switch List shows the work required to service all of
      the Trains visiting that Location. Normally a Switch List is
      given to the person in charge of a yard or a location with
      many spurs or industries.</p>

      <p>To Preview or Print a Switch List, select the location(s)
      and set your printer, then press <input name="button14" id=
      "button14" value="Preview Switch Lists" type="button"> or
      <input name="button15" id="button15" value=
      "Print Switch Lists" type="button"></p>

      <p><input name="button16" id="button16" value="Save" type=
      "button"> will store your selections.<br>

      <h3>Building Trains</h3>

      <p>To build one train, press <input name="button17" id=
      "button17" value="Build" type="submit"> in the row for the
      desired train in the <strong>Trains</strong> window. After
      the train is built <input name="button17" id="button18"
      value="Build" type="submit"> changes to <input name=
      "button18" id="button19" value="Print" type="submit"> or
      <input name="button52" id="button52" value="Preview" type=
      "button"> .</p>

      <p>You may select the Action that you want to perform on all
      trains that are selected.</p>

      <p><img style="width: 422px; height: 126px;" alt="action"
      src="images/Ops_Trains_action.png"></p>

      <p><img style="width: 1016px; height: 146px;" alt=
      "Trains build" src="images/Ops_TrainsBuild01.png"><br></p>

      <p>If you want to review how the train was built, select the
      <input name="checkbox5" id="checkbox5" checked="checked"
      type="checkbox"> <strong>Build Reports</strong> before
      pressing <input name="button19" id="button20" value="Preview"
      type="submit"> for the desired train.</p>

      <p><img style="width: 635px; height: 148px;" alt=
      "trains build" src="images/Ops_trainsBuild03.png"></p>

      <p>If the <input name="checkbox5" id="checkbox6" checked=
      "checked" type="checkbox"> <strong>Preview Manifest</strong>
      is selected, the program will generate the Build Report and
      manifest and present them in preview windows.</p>

      <p><img style="width: 319px; height: 126px;" alt=
      "trains build" src="images/Ops_TrainsBuild02.png"><br></p>

      <p>If you want to build several Trains without having to
      press individual buttons for each Train, select the Trains
      that you want built in the <strong>Build</strong> column
      <input name="checkbox5" id="checkbox7" checked="checked"
      type="checkbox"> and press <input name="button20" id=
      "button21" value="Build" type="submit"> found at the bottom
      of the Trains panel. The program will then build manifests
      for all of the selected Trains.</p>

      <p>If a Train fails to build, the <input name="button21" id=
      "button22" value="Move" type="submit"> will change its text
      to <input name="button22" id="button23" value="Report" type=
      "submit"> . Pressing <input name="button23" id="button24"
      value="Report" type="submit"> will print or preview the build
      report for this Train. Whenever a Train fails to build, a
      build failure message will appear. If you want to disable
      this feature, deselect the checkbox <input name="checkbox5"
      id="checkbox8" type="checkbox"> <strong>Build
      Messages</strong>.</p>

      <p>With <input name="checkbox5" id="checkbox9" checked=
      "checked" type="checkbox"> <a href=
      "Ops_ManifestPreview.shtml">Preview Manifest</a> press
      <input name="button24" id="button25" value="Preview" type=
      "submit"> and the Train Manifest is displayed using your
      system printer's preview window.</p>

      <p>With <input name="checkbox6" id="checkbox10" checked=
      "checked" type="checkbox"> <strong>Preview Manifest</strong>,
      <input name="checkbox7" id="checkbox11" checked="checked"
      type="checkbox"> <a href=
      "Ops_BuildReportPreveiw.shtml"><strong>Build
      Reports</strong></a> and <input name="checkbox8" id=
      "checkbox12" checked="checked" type="checkbox"> <strong>Build
      Messages</strong> selected, press <input name="button25" id=
      "button26" value="Preview" type="submit"> and all the Reports
      and Train Manifest are previewed, then you may print the
      desired Reports or Manifest using your system print
      dialog.</p>

      <h3>Problems building Trains</h3>

      <p>If you have a problem building a train you can select the
      <input name="checkbox9" id="checkbox13" checked="checked"
      type="checkbox"> <strong>Build Reports</strong> checkbox at
      the bottom of the train panel. When a build fails for any
      reason and the <input name="checkbox10" id="checkbox14"
      checked="checked" type="checkbox"> <strong>Build
      Reports</strong> checkbox is selected, the program will send
      a report to your printer if the <input name="checkbox11" id=
      "checkbox15" type="checkbox"> <strong>Preview
      Manifests</strong> isn't selected; or to a preview window if
      the <input name="checkbox12" id="checkbox16" checked=
      "checked" type="checkbox"> <strong>Preview Manifests</strong>
      is selected. The build report can print out different levels
      of detail, from minimal to very detailed. See the Settings
      section <a href="Ops_PrintOptions.shtml">Build Report
      Details</a> for more information on how to change the Build
      Report detail level.</p>

      <p>The program now confirms during the Build that all of the
      Cars in a Kernel have the same departure Location and
      Track.</p>

      <p>The program will wait for the scripts to complete prior to
      building a Train.</p>

      <h4>Building multiple Trains for a session</h4>

      <p>Most operating sessions require more than one Train to
      keep your operators busy. The correct way to do this is to
      build and print all of the Trains needed before terminating
      them. So if you need a dozen Trains for a session, you must
      build twelve Trains before you terminate any one Train.
      Terminating a Train tells the program that the Locomotives
      and Cars in that particular Train have been delivered to
      their final Locations and can be used again when building new
      Trains. So always build all, print all, THEN terminate each
      Train after completing its run! It is okay to build all
      Trains, print all Train, and then use the <input name=
      "button37" id="button45" value="Save Builds" type="submit">
      and shut down the program. Later you can restart the program
      and terminate the trains that completed their runs.</p>

      <p>The correct time to terminate a train is when the train
      actually arrives at its destination. Terminating a train
      before it completes it run means that the operation database
      believes that the engines and cars have been delivered. It is
      better to build and print twelve Trains and then later find
      out that only nine Trains completed their runs. You would
      then terminate nine Trains, and leave the other three for
      next time. Or if you wish you could reset any Trains that
      didn't depart from their terminal. Reseting Trains really
      isn't necessary, the Trains that didn't run during this
      session could run the during the next session.</p>

      <p>An alternate method is to build, print, and use the
      <input name="button39" id="button46" value="Move" type=
      "submit"> for each Train to track the actual movement of the
      Trains during your session. As long as the Trains on your
      layout match the Locations in the program you can build a new
      Train.</p>

      <h4>Moving Trains</h4>

      <p>After providing your operators with a printed manifest or
      location switch list, you must keep the program database
      synchronized with the actual movement of trains on your
      layout. This is done by the <input name="button38" id=
      "button47" value="Move" type="submit"> located on the far
      right of the train menu. Pressing the <input name="button40"
      id="button48" value="Move" type="submit"> will cause the
      train to depart its current location move to the next
      location in the route. The Engines and Cars assigned to the
      Train will travel to the next Location on the railroad. At
      each Location, Cars can be picked up or dropped off. You can
      also move a Train by selecting the Train's icon and selecting
      <input name="button41" id="button49" value="Move" type=
      "submit"> from the icon's popup menu. Each press of the
      <input name="button42" id="button50" value="Move" type=
      "submit"> moves the train closer to its terminal Location.
      When the Train arrives at the last Location in the Route, the
      last press of the <input name="button43" id="button51" value=
      "Move" type="submit"> will terminate the Train. Once a Train
      is terminated, you can build it again.</p>

      <p>Each time an Engine or Car is moved a count associated
      with them is incremented. The program uses this to determine
      which cars haven't moved recently and tries to select cars
      with the least number of moves when building new trains. Each
      time a location has a car picked up or dropped, the program
      increments a count associated with that location. The program
      tries to move cars to locations that have experienced the
      least number of car operations.</p>
