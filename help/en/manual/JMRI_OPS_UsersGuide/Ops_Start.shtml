      <h1>Using JMRI&reg; to Operate Trains</h1>

      <h2>What does OperationsPro do?</h2>

      <p>Using JMRI&reg; to operate trains allows you to build
      computer generated car Manifests for your railroad. A
      Manifest or Switch List details the work that a train will
      perform during an operations session. The Manifest provides a
      list of car pick up and set out and shows where the cars are
      located and where they should be eventually positioned on the
      railroad. The program allows you to build a Roster of cars,
      define Locations on the railroad, and Routes for Trains to
      travel. The Car Roster includes information about every car,
      including road name, number, type of car, color, length,
      weight, date built, and owner. Trains are assigned Routes
      that define Locations where cars can be picked up or set out.
      Features include the ability to control what car types, road
      names, and car loads a Location can service, the available
      track space for a Location, and the maximum length a the
      train can be between any two Locations on the train's
      Route.</p>

      <p>Locations can have Spurs, Yards, Staging tracks and
      Interchange tracks. Spurs are used to service industries, and
      can optionally have custom schedules assigned to them. Trains
      can be configured to require a caboose. Optionally, Trains
      can be configured to require a caboose or car with Flashing
      Rear End Device (FRED). The program generates car Manifests
      for each train and switch lists for any Location. A Switch
      List for a particular Location shows the work for all the
      Trains that visit that Location. The program can also place
      icons representing Trains on a JMRI Panel. The icon can be
      taught to move across the panel along with the train from
      Location to Location.</p>

      <p>The OperationsPro program is included in the JMRI&reg;
      suite of tools, so when you install and start up either
      DecoderPro&reg; or PanelPro you will find OperationsPro menus
      in the main menu bar under <strong>Tools &gt;
      Operations</strong> or as an <strong>Operations</strong>
      menu, if enabled in your <a href=
      "Ops_Settings.shtml">OperationsPro Settings</a>.</p>

      <h3>OperationsPro Demo Files</h3>

      <p>The OperationsPro program provides a set of demo files to
      help introduce you to the some of the features and
      capabilities of this program.</p>

      <table width="80%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding=
      "2">
        <tr>
          <td><a href="images/Ops_Start01.png"><img src=
          "images/Ops_Start01.png" width="243" height="241" alt=
          "Operations in Tools Menu"></a></td>

          <td valign="top">
            <a href="=&quot;images/Ops_Start02.png&quot;"><img src=
            "images/Ops_Start02.png" width="248" height="141" alt=
            "Operations in Main Menubar"></a>

            <p>Load the demo files from the <strong>Tools</strong>
            menu in the Operations &gt; Settings window, select
            <strong>Load Demo Files</strong>; the demo files will
            load after you restart DecoderPro.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Demo01.png" width="788" height="253"
      alt="Demo"></p>

      <p>Selecting Load Demo Files closes DecoderPro&reg; and it
      must be restarted to open the Demo Railroad.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Demo02.png" width="796" height="151"
      alt="Demo"></p>

      <p>The program will create a backup of your current
      configuration if you have one, and then load the demo files.
      Restart JMRI to complete the demo load process. To get rid of
      the demo files, use the <strong>Restore</strong> function in
      the <strong>Tools</strong> menu of the <strong>Operations
      Settings</strong> to reload the first backup date, which is
      the blank entry form.</p>

      <p>The program also supplies a simple Panel to show how the
      Train icons work. Load the Panel before building any Trains
      by selecting in the main JMRI menu, "Panels-&gt;Open Panels
      ...". A window should appear; open the "Operations" directory
      and then open the "Operations Demo Panel" xml file.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_DemoPanel.png" width="800" height=
      "220" alt="Demo panel"></p>

      <h3>Quick Start</h3>

      <p align="left">In the Main DecoderPro menu bar select the
      <strong>Tools</strong> menu. Near the bottom you will find
      "Operations".</p>

      <p align="left"><img src="images/Ops_menu.png" width="283"
      height="184" alt="ops menu"></p>

      <p align="left">There are six items in the submenu. It is
      recommended that you start with <strong>Settings</strong> and
      work your way down to <strong>Trains</strong>. We also
      recommend that when defining your Locations that you at first
      only use Yard spur tracks; try Staging and Interchange tracks
      when you're more comfortable with how OperationPro
      operates.</p>

      <h3>British Railways</h3>

      <p>The program supports an alternate set of railway
      terminology for our British modelers. To use British
      terminologies, go to the JMRI Advanced Preferences (Edit
      -&gt; Preferences...), select the <strong>Show Advanced
      Preferences</strong> checkbox and select <em>English (United
      Kingdom)</em> in the "Locale:" menu box. The program will
      also convert from centimeters to meters when entering wagon,
      locomotive, or location lengths; just append "cm" to any
      length.</p>
