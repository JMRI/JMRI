      <p>Using JMRI® to operate trains allows you to build computer generated car Manifests for
      your railroad. A Manifest or Switch List details the work that a train will perform during an
      operations session. The Manifest provides a list of car pick up and set out and shows where
      the cars are located and where they should be eventually positioned on the railroad. The
      program allows you to build a Roster of cars, define Locations on the railroad, and Routes
      for Trains to travel. The Car Roster includes information about every car, including road
      name, number, type of car, color, length, weight, date built, and owner. Trains are assigned
      Routes that define Locations where cars can be picked up or set out. Features include the
      ability to control what car types, road names, and car loads a Location can service, the
      available track space for a Location, and the maximum length a the train can be between any
      two Locations on the train's Route.</p>

      <p>Locations can have Spurs, Yards, Staging tracks and Interchange tracks. Spurs are used to
      service industries, and can optionally have custom schedules assigned to them. Trains can be
      configured to require a caboose. Optionally, Trains can be configured to require a caboose or
      car with Flashing Rear End Device (FRED). The program generates car Manifests for each train
      and switch lists for any Location. A Switch List for a particular Location shows the work for
      all the Trains that visit that Location. The program can also place icons representing Trains
      on a JMRI Panel. The icon can be taught to move across the panel along with the train from
      Location to Location.</p>

      <p>The OperationsPro program is included in the JMRI® suite of tools, so when you install and
      start up either DecoderPro® or PanelPro you will find OperationsPro menus in the main menu
      bar under <strong>Tools &gt; Operations</strong> or as an <strong>Operations</strong> menu,
      if enabled in your <a href="Ops_Settings.shtml">OperationsPro Settings</a>.</p>

      <h3>OperationsPro Demo Files</h3>

      <p>The OperationsPro program provides a set of demo files to help introduce you to the some
      of the features and capabilities of this program.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <a href="images/Ops_Start01.png"><img src="images/Ops_Start01.png" width="243" height=
            "241" alt="Operations in Tools Menu"></a>
          </td>
          <td>
            <a href="images/Ops_Start02.png"><img src="images/Ops_Start02.png" width="248" height=
            "141" alt="Operations in Main Menubar"></a>
            <p>Load the demo files from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu in the Operations &gt;
            Settings window, select <strong>Load Demo Files</strong>; the demo files will load
            after you restart DecoderPro.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Demo01.png" width="788" height="253" alt="Demo">
      </p>

      <p>Selecting Load Demo Files closes DecoderPro® and it must be restarted to open the Demo
      Railroad.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Demo02.png" width="796" height="151" alt="Demo">
      </p>

      <p>The program will create a backup of your current configuration if you have one, and then
      load the demo files. Restart JMRI to complete the demo load process. To get rid of the demo
      files, use the <strong>Restore</strong> function in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu of the
      <strong>Operations Settings</strong> to reload the first backup date, which is the blank
      entry form.</p>

      <p>The program also supplies a simple Panel to show how the Train icons work. Load the Panel
      before building any Trains by selecting in the main JMRI menu, "Panels-&gt;Open Panels ...".
      A window should appear; open the "Operations" directory and then open the "Operations Demo
      Panel" xml file.</p>

      </p>

      <h3>Quick Start</h3>

      <p>In the Main DecoderPro menu bar select the <strong>Tools</strong> menu. Near the bottom
      you will find "Operations".</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_menu.png" width="283" height="184" alt="ops menu">
      </p>

      <p>There are six items in the submenu. It is recommended that you start with
      <strong>Settings</strong> and work your way down to <strong>Trains</strong>. We also
      recommend that when defining your Locations that you at first only use Yard spur tracks; try
      Staging and Interchange tracks when you're more comfortable with how OperationPro
      operates.</p>

      <h3>British Railways</h3>

      <p>The program supports an alternate set of railway terminology for our British modelers. To
      use British terminologies, go to the JMRI Advanced Preferences (Edit -&gt; Preferences...),
      select the <strong>Show Advanced Preferences</strong> checkbox and select <em>English (United
      Kingdom)</em> in the "Locale:" menu box. The program will also convert from centimeters to
      meters when entering wagon, locomotive, or location lengths; just append "cm" to any
      length.</p>
