      <h3>Import locomotives from roster</h3>

      <p>This menu opens a system Import dialog box. If you already
      have a <span style="font-weight: bold;">DecoderPro&reg;
      locomotive roster</span> created eg. when programming
      decoders, you may import this roster into the OperationsPro
      Roster. All Locomotives that are not already in your
      OperationsPro Roster will be imported and a message will be
      displayed informing you of how many locomotives were
      imported:</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <img style="width: 313px; height: 122px;" alt=
        "import dialog" src="images/Ops_Successful_Import.png">
      </div>

      <p>This way you can use this tool any time you add
      Locomotives to your DecoderPro&reg; locomotive roster. The
      DecoderPro&reg; locomotive roster doesn't have the
      locomotive's length, so a default length is entered for you.
      You should manually correct the Locomotive Length in
      OperationsPro if you want the program to correctly calculate
      your Train lengths.</p>

      <p>Now that we have imported your DecoderPro locomotive
      roster into the OperationsPro Roster you will need to edit
      the entries to add the attributes that are required for
      OperationsPro but were not needed in the DecoderPro
      locomotive roster file when you programmed the decoders.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_EngineRoster.png" alt="Engine Roster"
      height="301" width="922"></p>

      <p>These engines were imported from JMRI Roster, so we will
      need to edit them to set the correct length, Consist,
      Location as required. The <a href=
      "Ops_EditEngines.shtml"><strong>Edit</strong></a> button in
      the <strong>Edit</strong> column will open the <strong>Edit
      Locomotives</strong> window and allow you to edit Locomotive
      attributes..</p>

      <p>The <a style="font-weight: bold;" href=
      "Ops_SetEngines.shtml">Set</a> button in the
      <strong>Set</strong> column for each locomotive in the roster
      will allow you to set the current Locomotive Location.</p>
