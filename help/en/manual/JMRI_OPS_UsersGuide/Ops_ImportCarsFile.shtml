      <h3>Import cars from file</h3>

      <p>Selecting <strong>Import cars from file</strong> from the
      Cars -&gt; Tools menu opens a system <strong>Open</strong>
      dialog box to allow you to select the file of your choice
      that meets the criteria defined below.<br>
      Note that OperationsPro will only add Cars that don't yet
      exist in the program's Car Roster. If a Car already exists,
      the import of that item will be skipped. You must also create
      the Locations and their Tracks before importing Cars into the
      OperationsPro program that use these place names.</p>

      <p>To improve the speed of the Car import, you may close the
      <strong>Cars</strong> window. It takes significantly more
      processor cycles to update the Cars panel during Import than
      to actually import the Car records.</p>

      <p>After importing your Car data, you must save the newly
      added entries if you want to keep them as part of your
      Roster. Select any Car in the Cars window list by pressing
      the <strong>Edit</strong> button and then press the
      <input name="button" id="button" value="Save" type="submit">
      that can be found at the bottom right of the <a href=
      "Ops_AddCars.shtml"><strong>Edit Car</strong></a> window.</p>

      <p>If you already have a list of Cars records in a database,
      you can import these into the program. The Import function
      requires an ASCII text file, with one line for each Car.<br>
      The import order is:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Car Number</li>

        <li>Car Road Name</li>

        <li>Car Type</li>

        <li>Car Length</li>

        <li>Car Weight</li>

        <li>Car Color</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The following shows two example records in the correct
      format:</p><code>336 GCR Flat 40 3.8 Black<br>
      655578 UP Boxcar 40 3.8 Yellow</code>

      <p>Each line can start with a space and multiple spaces
      between fields is okay. Optionally, you can include
      additional information in the following order:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Car Owner's Name</li>

        <li>Date Built</li>

        <li>Location</li>
      </ol>The Location can have two fields: the Location Name,
      followed by the Location's Track Name, separated by a hyphen
      "-".

      <p>The following shows two example records in the correct
      format:</p><code>336 GCR Flat 40 3.8 Black AT 1930 Home Town
      USA - George's Oil Terminal<br>
      655578 UP Boxcar 40 3.8 Yellow DB 1934 York - York
      Freight</code>

      <p>If you prefer to use comma delimiters instead of spaces,
      place the word "comma" at the start of your import file and
      use commas instead of spaces. The following are two examples
      of importing cars with comma delimiters:</p><code>comma<br>
      336,GCR,Flat Car,40,3.8,Black,AT,1930,Home Town
      USA,-,George's Oil Terminal<br>
      655578,UP,Tank Car,40,3.8,Yellow,DB,1934,York,-,York
      Freight</code>

      <p>You need to be very careful with spaces when importing a
      comma delimitated file. The program will include leading and
      trailing spaces if they exist between the commas.</p>
