      <h3>Import cars from file</h3>

      <p>Selecting <strong>Import cars from file</strong> from the Cars -&gt; Tools menu opens a
      system <strong>Open</strong> dialog box to allow you to select the file of your choice that
      meets the criteria defined below.<br>
      Note that OperationsPro will only add Cars that don't yet exist in the program's Car Roster.
      If a Car already exists, the import of that item will be skipped. You must also create the
      Locations and their Tracks before importing Cars into the OperationsPro program that use
      these place names.</p>

      <p>To improve the speed of the Car import, you may close the <strong>Cars</strong> window. It
      takes significantly more processor cycles to update the Cars panel during Import than to
      actually import the Car records.</p>

      <p>After importing your Car data, you must save the newly added entries if you want to keep
      them as part of your Roster. Select any Car in the Cars window list by pressing the
      <strong>Edit</strong> button and then press the <input name="button" id="button" value="Save"
      type="submit"> that can be found at the bottom right of the <a href=
      "Ops_AddCars.shtml"><strong>Edit Car</strong></a> window.</p>

      <p>If you already have a list of Cars records in a database, you can import these into the
      program. The Import function requires an ASCII text file, with one line for each Car.<br>
      The import order is:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Car Number</li>

        <li>Car Road Name</li>

        <li>Car Type</li>

        <li>Car Length</li>

        <li>Car Weight</li>

        <li>Car Color</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The following shows two example records in the correct format:</p>
      <code>336 GCR Flat 40 3.8 Black<br>
      655578 UP Boxcar 40 3.8 Yellow</code>
      <p>Each line can start with a space and multiple spaces between fields is okay. Optionally,
      you can include additional information in the following order:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Car Owner's Name</li>

        <li>Date Built</li>

        <li>Location</li>
      </ol>
      The Location can have two fields: the Location Name, followed by the Location's Track Name,
      separated by a hyphen "-".
      <p>The following shows two example records in the correct format:</p>
      <code>336 GCR Flat 40 3.8 Black AT 1930 Home Town USA - George's Oil Terminal<br>
      655578 UP Boxcar 40 3.8 Yellow DB 1934 York - York Freight</code>
      <p>If you prefer to use comma delimiters instead of spaces, place the word "comma" at the
      start of your import file and use commas instead of spaces. The following are two examples of
      importing cars with comma delimiters:</p>
      <code>comma<br>
      336,GCR,Flat Car,40,3.8,Black,AT,1930,Home Town USA,-,George's Oil Terminal<br>
      655578,UP,Tank Car,40,3.8,Yellow,DB,1934,York,-,York Freight</code>
      <p>You need to be very careful with spaces when importing a comma delimitated file. The
      program will include leading and trailing spaces if they exist between the commas.</p>
