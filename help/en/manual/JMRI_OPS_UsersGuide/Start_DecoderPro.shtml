      <p>The Operations Program is run from the DecoderPro&reg; Menu which is activated in the
      Operations Preferences.</p>

      <p>Once you have downloaded the DecoderPro&reg; software and installed it, simply open the
      program in the usual manner for your operating system. On MS Windows the installer will place
      an icon on your Desktop. For details please refer to the <a href=
      "../../html/setup/index.shtml">JMRI Setup Help</a>.</p>

      <p><img src="images/DesktopIcons.png" width="223" height="79" alt="desktop icons">
      </p>

      <p>Double click on the icon for the program to open, in this case we will open
      DecoderPro&reg;.</p>

      <p>The following dialog will appear briefly as the program is loading:</p>

      <p><img src="images/StartDialog.png" width="170" height="167" alt="Start dialog">
      </p>

      <p>You should see this or a similar opening screen displayed after one of the JMRI&reg; programs
      starts:</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Splash_Screen.png" width="496" height="282" alt="splash">
      </h1>

      <p>It may take a while for this screen to come up, especially on older and slower computers.
      Remember that you are essentially running the program on a Java emulator over your native
      operating system software. New computers can do this fairly quickly, but older ones will feel
      like they're taking forever. <strong>Be patient</strong> - it will come up eventually! Even
      on older computers, once the program is up the response time is quite good.</p>

      <p>If this is the first time you have run the program after you installed the software, the
      <a href="Start_Preferences.shtml">Preferences</a> screen will come up automatically to allow
      you to set up the system for your particular configuration. Also if you change your system
      configuration, OR if you have your laptop away from the railroad, but you want to play with
      JMRI there is a simulator mode you may want to try. So click next, and we"ll have a look at
      Preferences.</p>
