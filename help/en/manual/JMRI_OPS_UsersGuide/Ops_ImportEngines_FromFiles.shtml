      <h3>Import locomotives from file</h3>

      <p>Choosing <strong>Import locomotives from file</strong>
      from the <strong>Locomotives -&gt; Tools</strong> menu opens
      a system <strong>Open</strong> dialog box to allow you to
      select the file of your choice. It requires an ASCII text
      file, with one line for each Locomotive (Engine). The import
      order is:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Locomotive Number</li>

        <li>Locomotive Road Name</li>

        <li>Locomotive Model</li>

        <li>Locomotive Length</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The following shows two examples of the correct
      format:</p><code>236 UP RS4 40<br>
      5578 SP SW1200 42</code>

      <p>Each line can start with a space and multiple spaces
      between fields is okay. Optionally you can include additional
      information in the following order:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Owner Name</li>

        <li>Date Built</li>

        <li>Location</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The Location can have two fields: the Location Name
      followed by the Location's Track Name, separated by a hyphen
      "-". The following shows two example records in the correct
      format:</p><code>236 UP RS4 40 AT 1930 Home Town USA -
      locomotive Terminal<br>
      5578 SP SW1200 42 DB 1934 York - York locomotive Yard</code>

      <p>If you prefer to use comma delimiters instead of spaces,
      place the word "comma" at the start of your import file and
      use commas instead of spaces. The following are two examples
      of records to import using comma as
      delimiters.</p><code>comma<br>
      236,UP,RS 4,40,AT,1930,Home Town USA,-,locomotive
      Terminal<br>
      5578,SP,SW 1200,42,DB,1934,Town of York,-,York locomotive
      Yard</code>

      <p>You need to be very careful with spaces when importing a
      comma delimited file. The program will include leading and
      trailing spaces if they exist between the commas.</p>

      <p>Note that the program will only add Locomotives that don't
      exist in the program's Locomotive Roster. If a Locomotive
      already exists, the import of that record will be skipped by
      the program.</p>

      <p>After importing your Locomotives, you must save them if
      you want to keep them as part of your Roster then edit them
      to add missing attributes.</p>

      <p><img style="width: 799px; height: 256px;" alt=
      "engine roster" src="images/Ops_EngineRoster.png"></p>

      <p>These Locomotives were imported from your file, so now we
      will need to edit them to set missing attributes that are
      required in OperationsPro: Length, Consist, Location as
      required. The <a href=
      "Ops_EditEngines.shtml"><strong>Edit</strong></a> button in
      the Edit column will open the <strong>Edit
      Locomotive</strong> window and allow you to edit Locomotive
      attributes.</p>

      <p>The <a style="font-weight: bold;" href=
      "Ops_SetEngines.shtml">Set</a> button in the
      <strong>Set</strong> column for each Locomotive in the Roster
      allows you to set the Location.</p>
