      <h3>Set Cars (multiple)</h3>

      <p>You can select <strong>Set Cars</strong> from the <strong><a href=
      "Ops_Cars.shtml">Cars</a></strong> window's <strong>Tools</strong> menu. This allows you to
      change the Location, destination, status, or Train assignment for a group of Cars. This tool
      works the same as the <a href="#setcarlocation"><strong>Set Car Location</strong></a> tool
      described below, except that multiple Cars are modified in one action.<br>
      Select the Cars you want in the Cars table by Shift/Command + clicking their names, and then
      select <strong>Set Cars</strong> from the Tools menu. The first selected Car becomes the
      default, and if you press <input type="button" name="button" id="button" value="Change"> ,
      all of the other selected Cars will have the same settings as the default Car. Be sure to
      <input type="button" name="button5" id="button5" value="Save"> in the <a href=
      "Ops_Cars.shtml">Cars</a> window if you want to keep your changes.</p>

      <p>The following message displays when you choose <strong>Set Cars</strong> if (one of) the
      Cars you selected are part of a Train. This warns that when you save the changes from the
      <strong>Set Cars</strong> window, those Cars are no longer part of a previously built Train
      is was assigned to.</p>
