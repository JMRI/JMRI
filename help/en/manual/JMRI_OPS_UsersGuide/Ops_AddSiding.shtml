      <p align="left">A Spur Track is used to service an industry
      or just a place where a Car is loaded or unloaded. Spurs are
      very similar to <strong><a href=
      "Ops_AddYard.shtml">Yards</a></strong>. You can if you wish
      schedule the order that Cars will be delivered to a Spur, or
      demand Cars with certain Loads using <strong><a href=
      "Ops_schedule.shtml">Schedules</a></strong>.</p>

      <p>For a Train to service a Location, there must be at least
      one Track for that Location.</p>

      <p align="left">When a Car is placed at a Spur, the Car's
      Load status is modified. OperationsPro provides two Load
      names for all Cars: the default <strong>Empty</strong> (or
      <strong>E</strong>) and the default <strong>Load</strong> (or
      <strong>L</strong>). If a Car has one of these Loads when it
      arrives at a Spur, the Load will change to the other, i.e.
      <strong>E</strong> becomes <strong>L</strong> and
      <strong>L</strong> becomes <strong>E</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Add a Spur Track</h3>

      <p>To add a Track as a Spur, in the <a href=
      "Ops_AddLocations.shtml"><strong>Add/Edit
      Locations</strong></a> window select <strong>Tracks at this
      location</strong> <input name="radio" id="radio" value=
      "radio" checked="checked" type="radio">
      <strong>Spurs</strong>, then press <input name="button" id=
      "button" value="Add Spur Track" type="submit"> at the bottom
      of the window.<br>
      This opens the <strong>Add Spur Track</strong> window. Note
      most of the pane is greyed out until the new Spur Track is
      added to the database.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Ops_AddSiding.png" alt=
      "adds spur" height="726" width="750"></p>

      <p>Enter the <strong>Name</strong> <input name="textfield"
      id="textfield" type="text"> of the Spur Track. The Spur Name
      must be unique; the program will not allow two Spurs at one
      Location with identical names. However, if you want more than
      one Spur to have the same name on your Manifests and Switch
      Lists, add a hyphen and a number to the end of the Spur name.
      For example, "KingMine-1" and "KingMine-2" will both print as
      "KingMine". The program will remove the hyphen and number
      when printing Manifests and Switch Lists.</p>

      <p>Under <strong>This location is serviced by trains
      traveling</strong>, select at least one or any number of the
      directions depending on access to your Spur. We have selected
      <input name="checkbox" id="checkbox" checked="checked" type=
      "checkbox"> East and <input name="checkbox2" id="checkbox2"
      checked="checked" type="checkbox"> West</p>

      <p>You can decide which train direction the Spur can service.
      For example, if only south bound Trains can access the Spur,
      select "South" and deselect the other directions. This can be
      useful if you want to support only trailing point switching
      for a given Track. If a Spur Track can support multiple
      directions then select the ones that are appropriate. When
      the Location has certain directions disabled, those are
      greyed out and you can't use them for one of the Tracks.</p>

      <p>Local Switcher: If you want only a local switcher to
      service a Spur Track, deselect all of the direction boxes for
      that Spur Track. The program will only allow a Train that has
      <em>one</em> location in its Route (local switcher) to
      service the Spur. This would be useful if you wanted your
      Trains to pick up and drop Cars to a Yard, and then have a
      local switcher move them to the town's Spur Tracks.</p>

      <p>Next <strong>Select the rolling stock serviced by this
      spur</strong> to control the rolling stock a Spur can
      service. Note the handy <input name="button2" id="button2"
      value="Clear All" type="submit"> and <input name="button3"
      id="button3" value="Select All" type="submit"> buttons. Push
      <input name="button7" id="button7" value="Clear All" type=
      "submit"> to deselect all Car types, or <input name="button8"
      id="button8" value="Select All" type="submit"> to select all
      types, then select or deselect rolling stock types you wish
      the Spur to accept.</p>

      <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width=
      "90%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td align="left" valign="top" width="48%"><img src=

            <td align="left" valign="top" width="52%">

              id="textfield2" type="text"> enter the name of a new
              Spur Track to be serviced at this Location.</p>

              <p><strong>Length</strong> <input name="textfield3"
              id="textfield3" size="5" type="text"> of the siding
              track in scale feet. You may enter the measurement in
              actual inches as <input name="textfield4" id=
              "textfield4" value="6&quot;" size="5" type="text">
              and the program will convert to the scale feet that
              you select during setup.</p>

              <p>Press <input name="button10" id="button10" value=
              "Add Spur Track" type="button"> the siding track is

            </td>
          </tr>

      <p>The <strong>Add Spur Track</strong> window now displays

      <p>Only the items selected in the Location of this Spur will
