<p>The Comprehensive Programmer begins the same way as the Basic Programmer, with  a Programmer Setup Pane and a Roster Pane.  The content  are identical, so they will not be repeated here.
<p> Just be sure that you select the Comprehensive Programmer in the DecoderPro3 Preferences, Roster pane, Program TAB, then selelct locomotive you wish to program from the DecoderPro3 main screen from the roster list, now press the <strong>Progam </strong>button .

  <p>We have programmed the Athearn FP-45 in the Basic Programmer, it is on the roster list and has been addressed. If we want to add the extra features of the decoder, we will select the locomotive from the roster list then, set prefernces for Comprehensive Program then click  the <strong>Program</strong> button.</p>
<p>The Programmer window will open as shown below. All programmers, Basic and Comprehensive, open
    to the Roster Entry pane, which will be similar to that shown below for the FP-45.</p>
  <p>The programmer opens with  the roster entry page filled in because we selected the loco from the roster panel in the previous  screen..  Note that there are now a whole lot more TABs at the top of the page, allowing us to open many panes to program more features. The number of TABS will depend upon the decoder being programmed. This Tsunami Sound Programming has several TABS that are unique to sound decoders.</p>

  <p align="left">
Note that the <b>Roster</b> pane is essentially unchanged from the <b>Basic</b>
programmer, but the window has a LOT more options in the <b>Tabs</b>
at the top. If you are unsure how to handle the <b>Roster</b> information,
go back to that section in the <a href="Basic_Start.shtml"><strong>Basic
Programmer</strong></a>. If you're ready to move on to bigger and better things,
let's go to the next tab.</p>
