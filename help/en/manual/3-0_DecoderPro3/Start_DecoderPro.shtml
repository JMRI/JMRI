<h3>If you are a first time user with no entries in the roster or preferences set <a href="Start_DecoderPro_New.shtml">click here</a>.</h3>
<p>
  Once you have downloaded the JMRI software and installed it, simply
open the program in the usual manner for your operating system. An icon for DecoderPro3&reg; should be installed on your Desktop.<br>

<p>DecoderPro3&reg; may be opened by  double click on the Desktop icon and the DecoderPro3&reg; initial screen as shown below will be displayed on completion of startup with no roster entries.
<p><img src="images/start_dp3_main.png" width="900" height="232" alt="DP3 start">
<p>DecoderPro3 will open showing your roster entries if you already have established a roster of locomotives.<h1><img src="images/Splash_Screen_dp3.png" width="800" height="387" alt="DP3 splash"></h1>

<p>
It may take a while for this screen to come up, especially on older
and slower computers. Remember that you are essentially running the program
on a Java emulator over your native operating system software. New computers
can do this fairly quickly, but older ones will feel like they're taking
forever. Be patient - it will come up eventually! Even on older computers, once the program is up the response time is quite good.
<p>If this is the first time you have run the program after you installed the software, the <a href="Start_Preferences.shtml">Preferences</a> screen will  come up automatically to allow  you to set up the system for your particular configuration.&nbsp; Also if you change  your system configuration, or if you have your laptop away from the railroad,  but you want to play with JMRI there is a simulator mode you may want to  try.&nbsp; &nbsp;So click next, and we&rsquo;ll have a look at  preferences.
<p>Alternately. DecoderPro3 may be opened from DecoderPro Roster Menu
