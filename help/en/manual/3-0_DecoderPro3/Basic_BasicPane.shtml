<p>You may have noticed that at the  top of the window are Two tabs: <strong>Roster Entry</strong> and <strong>Basic</strong>.  We have completed the <strong>Roster Entry</strong> pane of the Program window, now,  click on the <strong>Basic</strong> tab to change panes to continue with programming your  decoder. The Basic pane will be displayed and look similar to the following illustration: 
Many panes in the programmer contain decoder dependent features,  as a result what you see may not exactly agree with what you see here.  Only those variables that your decoder can implement will be shown. </p>
<p>Below is a screen for Digitrax DN143IP that is used in the Burlington Zepher and is shown in factory settings, which is normally address 3.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/Basic_Program.png" alt="Basic Programming Pane" width=648 height=520 border=5 class="BOXIT"></div>
<p>You will see three options you can change, highlighted in  yellow: </p>
<ol> 
<li>The decoder address (should be unique among your  locomotives, unless you are operating sevral as a set) often the locomotive number is used.</li>
  <li>Two radio buttons that let you toggle between 2 digit  (one byte, &quot;Normal&quot;) or 4 digit <br>
(two byte, &quot;Extended&quot;) addressing </li>

 <li> Analog operation (enables the decoder to run under  regular DC voltage/analog <br>
control) Enable Analog Operation with caution, as some       decoders will jump to full speed resulting in a &ldquo;Runaway locomotive&rdquo; if       they are enabled for Analog Operation and encounter power spikes on a DCC       digital signal.&nbsp; They seem to get       confused, and revert to Analog operation and use the full track voltage       DCC power to take off and GO!&nbsp; There       is no stopping them without removing layout power.&nbsp; Very disturbing to your operating mates,       but better than  running into them at full tilt. </li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <p>To enable Analog (old style DC, some vendors refer  to this as dual mode) Operation select the appropriate entry from the drop-down  list. </p>
</ol>
<p>The yellow highlighting indicates  these options are &quot;probable&quot; settings and have not been 
confirmed from the decoder. Settings that have been changed by the user and  have not 
been written back to the decoder appear in a orange color. You will see  examples of <br>
this throughout the manual. </p>
<a name="Read Data"></a>
To read the actual settings  for these options (and  IF your system and installed decoder will allow readback of decoder values), click  on the  <strong>
<input type="button" name="button" id="button" value="Read full sheet">
</strong>. The individual settings  will turn red while they are in the process of 
  being read (clever, eh?), and will turn white once the  values have been read successfully 
  from the decoder. Once again, Decoder Pro must play  &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; to get this 
information, and sometimes even has to ask a couple of  times. 
  <p> Be patient, especially with older computers. At the very  bottom of the pane (where it says  &quot;idle&quot;) you will see a running account of  exactly what DecoderPro is doing, for example, the 
  specific CV being read. </p>
<p> Again, the
  <input type="button" name="button2" id="button2" value="Read full sheet"><strong> </strong>and <strong>
  <input type="button" name="button3" id="button3" value="Read all sheets">
  </strong>functions are  dependant on your command station. If 
  your system does not have the capability to read CVs,  then these buttons will not be 
  available. </p>
<p><a name="Enter/Edit data"></a>If you wish to change the address  of the locomotive, type in the new address. To turn on or off 4 digit  addressing, select the desired radio button. .&nbsp;  Be sure that the address  type agrees with the number of characters in the address.&nbsp;</p>
<p> When you are finished, click on 
  <input type="button" name="button4" id="button4" value="Write full sheet">
to  write the new values in the decoder. </p>
  <p><a name="Write Data"></a>Writing usually takes much less time than reading,  because the value   can be sent directly.     As the write operation proceeds, the data will change  from yellow to   white. If there is     difficulty writing to the decoder, the data will change  to red. The   software will automatically   keep trying until the write operation is successful. In some instances   the  system will &ldquo;time-out&rdquo; after a certain number of tries without an    acknowledgement from the decoder.&nbsp; This  does not necessarily mean that   the values have not been written, just that the  program has not   received an acknowledgement.&nbsp;  This can be due to &nbsp;the locomotive    moving and getting on dirty track so that it can&rsquo;t pulse back, or   possibly  because the command station or decoder cannot read back.&nbsp; Try   moving the loco and try again.&nbsp; If it is a command station or decoder    read-back issue, try the loco on the mainline and see if the programming   was  successful. </p>
  <p><a name="Save Data"></a>
  To finish this &quot;basic&quot; programming of a  decoder, click once more on the <strong>Roster Entry</strong> tab, You will see that the  address field has now been filled in, so  you can now 
  click on the <strong>
  <input type="button" name="button5" id="button5" value="Save to roster">
</strong>. Your new decoder  settings have now been written not only 
  to the decoder, but also saved to a computer file where  they may be recalled in the future. </p>
<p>I have programmed the address for this locomotive and clicked on the Write full sheet button to send the address to the command station to program the decoder. Note that the status line keeps you updated as to what is writing and should finish with OK, which is good or an error message which usually meand the write was not completed.  All the entries are now in white color as they match the decoder.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Basic_Address.png" width="636" height="556" alt="basic address"><br>
</p>
<p> Now that we have entered the Roster data and set thedesired address, lets return to DecoderPro3 Main window by closing the Programming window.</p>
<p>Notice that we now have a list of all the locomotives programmed so far that are in our roster.</p>
<p><img src="images/Main_01b_main.png" width="900" height="521" alt="main window"></p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve done so far is what is available  in the Basic mode of programming in DecoderPro 3.&nbsp; A good place to start for new folks or at a  club.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to go wrong, but you can  change the loco address and add it the roster, which are the two most often  needed actions with programming. <br>
  <br>
  The classic DecoderPro offered a number of  modes, most of which were often redundant and confusing showing how the user  could edit the underlying file to make special application programming modes. The  Comprehensive Programmer was the most popular for a long time until Advanced  came along with added features.&nbsp; So now they&rsquo;ve  been combined in DecoderPro3. Thus the Comprehensive Programmer  with added Advanced features is the only other programmer that DecoderPro3 offers. <br>
  Since we&rsquo;ve already covered <strong>Basic</strong>,  let's explore the DecoderPro3 <a href="Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">Comprehensive  Programmer</a>! </p>
<p>At the bottom of the window is the  <a href="RosterMedia.shtml">Labels &amp; Media</a> and<a href="dp3_Main_Throttle.shtml">Throttle</a> buttons. Use these buttons to set up the Icon photos for  your roster entries and to set-up the Function Labels on the software throttle included in JMRI.&nbsp; Click the links that we&rsquo;ve included  and take a look.</p>
