<p>The Add Route Window opens and now you can add a route to your Operations data base.</p>

<h4>Menu Bar</h4>
<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>

<p><strong>Window</strong>-- Standard DecoderPro&reg; window menu.</p>
<p><strong>Help</strong> -- Standard DecoderPro&reg; window menu.</p>
<p>Type  the route <strong>Name</strong>
  <input name="textfield" type="text" id="textfield" size="30">
. Each route must have a unique name. </p>
<p>Then  press 
  <input type="submit" name="button" id="button" value="Add">
located at the bottom of the window. The Add Route window now activates the attributes required to enter the route.</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute01.png" width="897" height="311" alt="Add Route"></p>
<p> Now  select the location from which the train will depart by selecting the location 
  <select name="select" id="select">
    <option>North Yard</option>
  </select>
located at the left bottom side of the window. </p>
<p>Select 
  <input name="radio" type="radio" id="radio" value="radio" checked> 
  Add location to start   
  <input type="radio" name="radio2" id="radio2" value="radio2"> 
  Add location at end
</p>
<p>Press 
  <input type="submit" name="button2" id="button2" value="Add Location">
.Updated Add Route window will be displayed.</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute02.png" width="896" height="308" alt="Add route"></p>
<p> Now build your route by selecting the next location the train  will visit, select all locations that the train will pass through even  if the train will not work the location. This way your train's engineer  will know when reading his manifest the towns he will be traveling  through. Each time you add a location to the route, the table shows the  order in which the train will visit. You can move a location up or down  in the sequence if needed. </p>
<p>We will now add all the locations to the route. Now make sure that 
  <input name="radio3" type="radio" id="radio3" value="radio3" checked> 
<strong>Add location at end</strong> is selected to add after the first location. </p>
<p>Make sure you press  
  <input type="submit" name="button3" id="button3" value="Save Route"> 
  when you are done with entering the locations.
</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute03.png" width="896" height="373" alt="Add Route"></p>
<p>We have now added a route that will go around the layout and return to the North Yard.</p>
<p>Each <strong>Location</strong> has the train's departure direction(<strong>Train Direction</strong>), number of desired car  <strong>Moves</strong>, and whether car <strong>Pickups?</strong> and or car Drops? are allowed at that  location. </p>
<p>You can also adjust the maximum train length (<strong>Max Length</strong>) that can depart  that location. A car move can be a car pickup or car drop at that  location. For example, 5 moves can be 5 pickups or 5 drops or any  combination of 5 pickups or drops. </p>
<p>The <strong>Grade</strong> is used to determine how many engines the train will  require for that segment. The<strong> X</strong> and<strong> Y</strong> are the coordinates on your  dispatcher's panel for the optional train icon. You can set the  coordinates here, or use the "SetX&amp;Y" train icon popup menu to teach the  program where you want the train icon placed when the train is at the  specified location. Leave the X and Y coordinates at zero if you want to  manually move the icon or you're not using the icon feature. After  setting the number of moves, maximum length, or coordinates, click on  the table to make sure it is recognized by the program.</p>
<p>Press
  <input type="submit" name="button4" id="button4" value="Save Route"> 
  which save your route.  The program will create a file  (OperationsRouteRoster.xml) in your JMRI directory in a folder called  "operations". A backup file with the last settings for all of your  routes is also created each time  
  <input type="submit" name="button5" id="button5" value="Save Route">
pressed.</p>
<p>Now we have our first route set up.</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute04.png" width="897" height="369" alt="Add Route"></p>
<p>You may start a new route using the Add Route window and entering a new route name and repeat this process for each route.</p>
<p>Now back to the Route window, which will show us a list of all the routes.</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_Routes01.png" width="457" height="161" alt="Routes"></p>
<p>Note that you may press 
  <input type="submit" name="button6" id="button6" value="Edit"> 
on any route and the <strong>Edit Route</strong> window opens which is identical to the <strong>Add Route</strong> window. </p>
<p>You may now press 
  <input type="submit" name="button7" id="button7" value="Add"> 
  to add another route, repeating the process just completed.
</p>
<p>Now that we have routes setup we need to set up some<a href="Ops_Trains.shtml"> Trains.</a></p>
