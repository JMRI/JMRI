      <p>This pane provides for control of some of the most
      "gee-whiz" functions on the decoder. While fine-tuning the
      motor is important, and speed tables help add to the realism
      of operation, everyone notices the lights - especially when
      they change intensity, flicker, flash, or fade. They attract
      even more attention when, for example, the ditch lights that
      were steadily shining as the locomotive approached the
      crossing suddenly begin flashing alternately, then return to
      a steady glow; or when a locomotive pulls into a siding,
      stops, and dims its headlight for the approaching train. All
      these effects are possible with the right decoder and proper
      setup, and setup is what DecderPro is all about.</p>

      <p>Every Manufacturer and decoder family handles the lighting
      in a unique manner, so there are many versions of this
      pane.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Comp_06_Lights.png" alt=
      "light pane" height="799" width="918"></p>

      <p>The specific effects available differ widely between
      manufacturers, and even between different "families" of
      decoders from the same maker. The above example is from a
      Digitrax FX decoder. Some of the advanced features you will
      see in many decoders (though they may go by different but
      similar names)</p>

      <p>The <b>Lamp keep-alive voltage</b> determines how dark a
      light gets between "full on" moments. This can let you adjust
      effects to give the impression of, for example, a marker
      light that also has a rotary beacon in the same housing. Play
      with this value and see what kind of results you get for your
      specific decoder.</p>

      <p><b>FX rate adjust</b> controls how fast an FX effect
      operates. The higher the number, the slower the frequency of
      flash or "rotation" of the effect. This can be used to set
      subtle differences between locomotives. As you can see from
      the panel above, there are twin alternating strobe lights on
      the engines.If you vary the setting for the <b>FX Rate</b>
      slightly, the locomotives flash at slightly different rates.
      This keeps MU units from looking <u>too</u> coordinated!</p>

      <p><b>Ditch light hold-over time</b> CV establishes how long
      the ditch light effect (alternating flashing) stays activated
      after you hit the <b>F2</b> function key. Since the <b>F2</b>
      key is non-latching (think of it as a momentary contact
      switch) that normally turns off when it is released. By
      raising the value of this CV you can make them stay on for up
      to 30 seconds from a single momentary activation.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Comp_06A_Lights.png" alt=
      "lignt pane" height="800" width="923"></p>

      <p>Sound decoders such as the Tsunami in our OEM FP-45 has an
      extremely complicated Lighting progam pane.</p>

      <p><img style="width: 900px; height: 594px;" alt=

      <p>Note that some of the lighting functions can be tied to a
      sound function which is unique to sound decoders. Sound
      decoders have many more functions than normal motor control
      decoders.</p>

      <p>The other lighting effects are highly variable between
      decoders. Check your specific decoder documentation for what
      the decoder is supposed to be capable of doing, and have fun
      playing with them. They are the most visually satisfying of
      all the capabilities of the decoders!</p>

      <p>Even if the function and effect are available, you may
      have to add the lighting to your locomotive in order to be
      able to use that function, such as adding ditch lights,
      beacons, etc.</p>
