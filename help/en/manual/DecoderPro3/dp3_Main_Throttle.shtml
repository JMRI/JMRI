      <p>The JMRI&reg; Throttle may be used on your computer screen
      to replace the vendor throttle that is furnished with your
      DCC system. One or several throttles may be in use at one
      time. The Throttle opens as a floating window that may be
      positioned anywhere on your desktop. Note the Title Bar
      contains the locomotive Roster ID information or the
      Locomotive address.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style=
      "width: 512px; height: 538px;" alt="Throttle" src=
      "images/Main_Throttle01.png"><br></p>

      <p>(color shading added to show functional areas of throttle
      panels)</p>

      <p>The Throttle Window contains <a href=
      "dp3_Main_Throttle_menubar.shtml"><strong>Menu
      Bar</strong></a>, <a href=
      "dp3_Main_Throttle_toolbar.shtml"><strong>Toolbar</strong></a>
      and three panels which may be enabled or disabled via check
      box in the View menu. Each panel has a title bar with windows
      controls to minimize, maximize and exit: :</p>

      <p style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102); font-weight: bold;">
      <strong>Warning!!!</strong> Be careful with the left hand
      (minimize) buttons. In Windows, if the little guy is clicked
      it will minimize the panel, which means it is no longer
      visible but the restore button is lost behind the rest of the
      panels. The way to easily get it back, is to go into the view
      menu, uncheck it there, then go back again and re-check it.
      You may also drag the panels out of the way to uncover the
      Maximize icon for a minimized panel.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "dp3_Main_Throttle_addressPanel.shtml"><strong>Address
      Panel</strong></a> (green shading) facilitates setting the
      address of the locomotive you wish to control with the
      throttle.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "dp3_Main_Throttle_controlPanel.shtml"><strong>Speed Control
      Panel</strong></a> (blue shading) contains the controls for
      applying power to the locomotive that is addressed and
      controlling speed</p>

      <p><a href=
      "dp3_Main_Throttle_functionPanel.shtml"><strong>Function
      Panel</strong></a>(yellow shading) contains all the function
      buttons used to control the addressed locomotives
      functions.</p>

      <p class="important">The descriptions shown above are only a
      small part of what the <strong>Throttle</strong> Window can
      do. The author(s) of the <strong>Throttle</strong> Window
      have created an extensive set of Help files to help you
      customize Throttle Windows to your way of operating. To
      access Help, just open a New <strong>Throttle</strong>. Then,
      click on <strong>Help</strong> and select <strong>Window
      Help</strong> from the dropdown box. There's lots of good
      stuff in there.</p>
