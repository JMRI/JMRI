      <p>The <strong>Speed Table</strong> allows you to fine-tune
      the throttle response of your locomotive. You might opt to
      match all of your locomotives so they run at the same speed
      for the same throttle setting, or you might want to set the
      table up so that your locomotive runs at the actual scale
      speed indicated by the throttle. Or maybe you have someone in
      your operating group that likes to switch the yard at Mach
      2.5, and you want to slow them down a bit. There are a lot of
      ways to use this feature. (This feature may vary by
      manufacturer and decoder series) Some decoders may only have
      preset curves that you can select.</p>

      <p>You now have the option of using <strong>Speed
      Table</strong> (this pane) which if selected and written to
      the decoder will replace the <a href=
      "Comp_Speed.shtml"><strong>Basic Speed Control</strong></a>
      to set your locomotive's speed control mode. Which ever one
      you select last and write to your decoder will be the method
      used for speed control. To select the use of <strong>speed
      tables</strong>, the <strong>Use Table</strong> radio button
      is selected at the top of the pane, and in the case of
      Soundtraxx and QSI decoders, the drop down selection box must
      be used. See the discussion at the end of this section for an
      example.</p>

      <p>The default speed table for most decoders is a straight
      line from zero on the left to maximum on the right. The
      <b><input name="button" id="button" value="Force Straight"
      type="button"></b> below the table duplicates that in the
      table..</p>

      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img src=
      "images/Speed_Table_Straight.png" alt="speed table" height=
      "701" width="804"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Straight Line Speed
      Curve</strong></p>

      <p>As you can see, you have both numbers and sliders to work
      with. Changing either a number or slider will make the other
      change to match it. If you are CV inquisitive, you can use
      the tool tip to advantage. By hovering over any of the
      sliders, the tool tip will reveal the CV to which you are
      pointing .</p>

      <p>The <strong><input name="button2" id="button2" value=
      "Match ends" type="button"></strong> will also result in a
      straight-line graph, but you can offset the beginning and end
      by any amount you wish. The first and last steps are used to
      set to minimum and maximum values for the straight line. The
      function will then draw a straight line between those two end
      points. Below is an example of the result.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Match.png" alt=
      "speed table match" height="315" width="914"></h1>

      <p>Now if you've used DecoderPro in the past, you're probably
      wondering what those little boxes at the bottom of each
      slider are used for. Well, they're difficult to explain, but
      easy to use. They basically allow you to set a slider to
      control every slider in columns to its left as well as to its
      right. If you click two of the boxes and then move one of
      those sliders you'll see that they are linked to the sliders
      between them. Points to the right never are higher than the
      slider being moved, and the points to the left are never
      lower that the slider being moved. This "always increasing
      left to right" is normally the way the sliders worked, but
      now the ones in between the check are linked. If the slider
      is lowered and then raised the straight line is drawn between
      the column checked to the right and the column that the
      slider is controlling. It's difficult to describe, but try it
      and you'll see.</p>

      <p><br>
      What could that possibly be used for, you ask? Well, many
      decoders (like the Soundtraxx Tsunami in this example) do not
      support V-start, V-mid and V-max. So, if you are trying to
      use the simplified method of speed matching locos, these
      decoders won't support it. Well now you have a way. Check the
      left-hand, right-hand and middle columns. Set the left-hand
      column to V-start, the right-hand to V-max and then slide the
      middle slider up and down until you get the V-mid that you
      want. Now all you have to do is write this speed table to the
      loco and you've accomplished what you wanted to do, but the
      decoder manufacturer didn't provide for.</p>

      "Speed Match" height="527" width="922"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Substitute for Quick Speed
      Matching</strong></p>

      <p align="left">If you want to set up a loco for switching
      you can set a start speed that is the same for the first
      portion of the throttle revolution and lower the top speed
      for use in the yard as shown below:</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Constant.png" alt=
      "Speed Table - Constant Ratio Curve" border="5" height="270"
      width="800"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Switcher Speed Curve</strong></p>

      <p>if you don't desire a strait-line response curve there are
      other options available. The Constant ratio curve gives you a
      response that increases slowly in the low end and rapidly at
      high throttle. This function will also draw the curve between
      preset end points.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Switcher.png" alt="switcher"
      height="335" width="807"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Constant Ratio Curve</strong></p>

      <p>The <b>Log curve</b> reverses this response, giving you a
      logarithmic response curve with high acceleration at low
      speeds, but topping out quickly. It will also draw the curve
      between preset end points.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Log.png" alt="log" height=
      "345" width="851"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Logarithmic Speed
      Curve</strong></p>

      <p align="center"></p>

      <p>The <input name="button3" id="button3" value="Shift left"
      type="button"> moves the entire speed table to the left one
      space with each click on the button. The example below shows
      a linear 0-255 speed table that has been <b>Shifted left</b>
      three times.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_ShiftLeft.png" alt=
      "shift left" height="369" width="840"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Curve Shifted Left</strong></p>

      <p>The <input name="button4" id="button4" value="Shft right"
      type="button"> move the entire speed table to the right one
      space with each click on the button. The example below shows
      a linear 0-255 speed table that has been <b>Shifted right</b>
      three times.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_ShiftRight.png" alt=
      "shift right" height="331" width="824"></h1>

      <p align="center"><strong>Curve Shifted Right</strong></p>

      <p>Of course, you can enter the numbers individually or move
      the sliders one at a time to create your own fully customized
      speed table. To aid you with setting the individual values,
      the slider value is shown at the top of each slider. Also, by
      hovering the mouse at a slider column the number of the CV
      being entered will be revealed.</p>

      <p>One very important thing to remember: <span class=
      "ACCENT"><strong>No matter how pretty your speed table looks,
      it has absolutely no effect on the locomotive unless you
      write it to the decoder!</strong></span></p>

      <p>And this point is especially pertinent with the QSI and
      Soundtraxx Tsunami decoders, because they have a separate
      drop down box like the QSI box below. They require that you
      select the <strong>user defined</strong> speed table entry in
      this box or your table will not be written to the decoder.
      Interestingly, Tsunami puts the selection at the bottom of
      the list making it very easy to miss.</p>

      There are some "gotchas" with programming speed curves in various decoders:

      <ul>
        <li>The NMRA S9.2.2 specifies that all decoders must provide CV2 (Vstart). 
        The provision of CV6 (Vhigh) and CV5 (Vhigh) is optional. 
        These three CVs are to be active only when Bit 4 of CV29 is 0. 
        Speed tables are optional and use CVs 66 (Fwd Trim) 67-94 (the actual speed curve) and 95 (Rev Trim).
        These thirty CVs are to be active only when Bit 4 of CV29 is 1. 
        The disadvantage of this speed table specification is that any tweaking of 
        starting or maximum speeds requires reshaping 
        of the entire speed curve. 

        <li>SoundTraxx Tsunami decoders differ from the standard. 
        When the speed table is active (Bit 4 of CV29 is 1), 
        the value in CV2 is not ignored but is effectively (in the decoder) a
        dded to CVs 67-94 in the speed table, 
        pushing it upwards. The advantage of this variation from the NMRA standard is that 
        you can tweak the starting speed without reshaping the whole curve, 
        but the disadvantage is that you can effectively flatten the top end of 
        the speed table it the maximum speed was already high.

        <li>QSI decoders differ from the standard. When the speed table is active 
        (Bit 4 of CV29 is 1), the values in CVs 2 and 5 are not ignored. 
        If either of CVs 2 or 5 are non-zero, these become the actual Vstart 
        and/or Vhigh and the effective values in CVs 67-94 are compressed or expanded (scaled) 
        in the decoder so the actual curve starts and/or ends on any non-zero value in 
        Vstart and/or Vhigh. 
        The advantage of this variation from the NMRA standard is that you can tweak 
        both starting and maximum speeds without reshaping the whole curve, 
        but the disadvantage is that if your speed table already covered a restricted range, 
        the curve will be expanded, 
        with possible integer multiplication errors producing glitches in the speed table.

        <li>ESU V4 and Select decoders differ from the standard (except in some early firmware versions) . When the speed table is active (Bit 4 of CV29 is 1), the values in CVs 2 and 5 are not ignored, but ALWAYS specify the actual Vstart and Vhigh of the loco. In addition the value of CV67 is fixed (read only) at 1 and the value of CV94 is fixed (read only) at 255. You therefore need to fit your speed table curve shape between these fixed end points. The effective values in CVs 67-94 are compressed (in the decoder) so the actual curve always starts and ends on the values in Vstart and Vhigh. The advantage of this variation from the NMRA standard is that you can tweak both starting and maximum speeds without reshaping the whole curve and without the possible multiplicative errors in the QSI approach. The LokProgrammer and JMRI DecoderPro software both enforce the restrictions on CVs 67 and 94 so you know what your speed table will actually look like. Also, the minimum value for CV2 is 1, so you cannot set the loco to be stationary at step 1.

    </ul>
    The important thing to make very clear is that 
    ALL FOUR DIFFERENT APPROACHES ALLOW FULL CONTROL OF SETTING THE ENTIRE SPEED RANGE OF THE LOCO. 
    There is no limitation on setting of starting or maximum speed. 
    But you MUST be aware of the different ways of setting up different decoders. 
    The other important point is that THIS DOES NOT PREVENT SPEED MATCHING of different brands, 
    you just have to be aware of the different ways of setting up each brand.
    <p>
    The best way of avoiding problems is with any brand or mix thereof is to match speed steps in this order 1,28,14,7,21,... 
    This will avoid any problems with any brand.
    <p>
    Footnote: Speed tables must always increase monotonically (i.e. no speed step can have a value lower 
    than the previous speed step). 
    Failure to do observe this restriction can cause strange behaviour in some decoders 
    so both LokProgrammer and JMRI DecoderPro prevent you from doing so.
