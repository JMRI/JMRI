<p>The <strong>Speed Table</strong> allows you to fine-tune the
throttle response of your locomotive. You might opt to match all of
your locomotives so they run at the same speed for the same throttle
setting, or you might want to set the table up so that your locomotive
runs at the actual scale speed indicated by the throttle. Or maybe you
have someone in your operating group that likes to switch the yard at
Mach 2.5, and you want to slow them down a bit. There are a lot of ways
to use this feature. (This feature may vary by manufacturer and decoder
series) Some decoders may only have preset curves that you can select.</p><p> You  now have the option of using <strong>Speed Table </strong>(this pane) which if selected  and written to the decoder will replace the <a href="Comp_Speed.shtml"><strong>Basic Speed Control</strong></a>
to set your locomotive's speed control mode. Which ever one you select
last and write to your decoder will be the method used for speed
control. To select the use of <strong>speed tables</strong>, the <strong>Use Table</strong>
radio button is selected at the top of the pane, and in the case of
Soundtraxx and QSI decoders, the drop down selection box must be
used.&nbsp; See the discussion at the end of this section for an
example. </p><p>The default speed table for most decoders is a straight line from zero on the left to maximum on the right.  The <b>
    <input name="button" id="button" value="Force Straight" type="button">
</b>  below the table duplicates that in the table..
</p><h1 style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/Speed_Table_Straight.png" alt="speed table" height="701" width="804"></h1>
<p align="center"><strong>Straight Line Speed Curve</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, you have both numbers and sliders to work with.
Changing either a number or slider will make the other change to match
it. If you are CV inquisitive, you can use the tool tip to
advantage.&nbsp; By hovering over any of the sliders, the tool tip will
reveal the CV to which you are pointing . </p><p>The <strong>
    <input name="button2" id="button2" value="Match ends" type="button">
</strong> will also result in a straight-line graph, but you can offset
the beginning and end by any amount you wish. The first and last steps
are used to set to minimum and maximum values for the straight line.
The function will then draw a straight line between those two end
points. Below is an example of the result.
</p><h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Match.png" alt="speed table match" height="315" width="914"></h1>
<p>Now if you&#8217;ve used DecoderPro in the past, you&#8217;re probably wondering
what those little boxes at the bottom of each slider are used
for.&nbsp; Well, they&#8217;re difficult to explain, but easy to use.&nbsp;
They basically allow you to set a slider to control every slider in
columns to its left as well as to its right.&nbsp; If you click two of
the boxes and then move one of those sliders you&#8217;ll see that they are
linked to the sliders between them.&nbsp; Points to the right never are
higher than the slider being moved, and the points to the left are
never lower that the slider being moved. This &#8220;always increasing left
to right&#8221; is normally the way the sliders worked, but now the ones in
between the check are linked. If the slider is lowered and then raised
the straight line is drawn between the column checked to the right and
the column that the slider is controlling. &nbsp;It&#8217;s difficult to
describe, but try it and you&#8217;ll see.
</p><p><br> What could that possibly be used for, you ask?&nbsp; Well,
many decoders (like the Soundtraxx Tsunami in this example) do not
support V-start, V-mid and V-max.&nbsp; So, if you are trying to use
the simplified method of speed matching locos, these decoders won&#8217;t
support it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well now you have a way.&nbsp; Check the
left-hand, right-hand and middle columns.&nbsp; Set the left-hand
column to V-start, the right-hand to V-max and then slide the middle
slider up and down until you get the V-mid that you want.&nbsp; Now all
you have to do is write this speed table to the loco and you&#8217;ve
accomplished what you wanted to do, but the decoder manufacturer didn&#8217;t
provide for.

<p align="center"><strong>Substitute for Quick Speed Matching</strong></p>
<p align="left">If you want to set up a loco for switching you can set
a start speed that is the same for the first portion of the throttle
revolution and lower the top speed for use in the yard as shown below:</p>
<h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Constant.png" alt="Speed Table - Constant Ratio Curve" border="5" height="270" width="800"></h1>
<p align="center"><strong>Switcher Speed Curve</strong></p>
<p>if you don't desire a strait-line response curve there are other
options available. The Constant ratio curve gives you a response that
increases slowly in the low end and rapidly at high throttle. This
function will also draw the curve between preset end points.</p>
<h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Switcher.png" alt="switcher" height="335" width="807"></h1>
<p align="center"><strong>Constant Ratio Curve</strong></p>
<p>
  The <b>Log curve</b> reverses this response, giving you a logarithmic
  response curve with high acceleration at low speeds, but topping out
  quickly. It will also draw the curve between preset end points.
</p><h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Log.png" alt="log" height="345" width="851"></h1>

<p align="center"><strong>Logarithmic Speed Curve</strong>
</p><p align="center">
</p><p>The
  <input name="button3" id="button3" value="Shift left" type="button">
moves the entire speed table to the left one space with each click on
the button. The example below shows a linear 0-255 speed table that has
been <b>Shifted left</b>  three times. 
  
</p><h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_ShiftLeft.png" alt="shift left" height="369" width="840"></h1>
<p align="center"><strong>Curve Shifted Left</strong></p>
<p>The 
  <input name="button4" id="button4" value="Shft right" type="button">
move the entire speed table to the right one space with each click on
the button. The example below shows a linear 0-255 speed table that has
been <b>Shifted right</b> three times. </p>
<h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_ShiftRight.png" alt="shift right" height="331" width="824"></h1>
<p align="center"><strong>Curve Shifted Right</strong></p>
<p>Of course, you can enter the numbers individually or move the
sliders one at a time to create your own fully customized speed table.
To aid you with setting the individual values, the slider value is
shown at the top of each slider.&nbsp; Also, by hovering the mouse at a
slider column the number of the CV being entered will be revealed.
</p><p>
One very important thing to remember: <span class="ACCENT"><strong>No matter
how pretty your speed table looks, it has absolutely no effect on the locomotive
unless you write it to the decoder!</strong></span></p>
<p>And this point is especially pertinent with the QSI and Soundtraxx
Tsunami decoders, because they have a separate drop down box like the
QSI box below.&nbsp; They require that you select the <strong>user defined</strong>
speed table entry in this box or your table will not be written to the
decoder.&nbsp; Interestingly, Tsunami puts the selection at the bottom
of the list making it very easy to miss. </p>
