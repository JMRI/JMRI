      <p>In short, DCC is Digital Command Control, a system for
      operating model railroads in a more prototypical manner. Each
      locomotive contains a tiny, specialized controller. These
      controllers (decoders) accept digital commands over a network
      (the rails) addressed to them and interprets them to control
      the locomotive's speed, direction, lighting effects, sound,
      and other functions. Each decoder responds only to those
      commands addressed to it. Not every decoder will have
      functions beyond basic throttle commands available. Although
      there are NMRA&reg; standards for the format of communication
      (allowing the decoders from different manufacturers to work
      on the same railroad), beyond that there is considerable
      variety in the functions supported and the implementation of
      those functions.</p>

      <p>Just like any other controller, decoders must be
      programmed by the user to reach their full potential. While
      they come with basic "default" programs, most users will want
      to customize the decoder address, motor control, lights,
      sound, and other functions to meet their specific needs. You
      do so by editing <b>CV</b>s, or <b>Configuration
      Variables</b>, in the decoder. Some CVs use values ranging
      from 0 to 255, others use their space in the decoder's memory
      as a bank of 8 on/off switches. While this lets you do a lot
      with very little memory, it can get very complex for those of
      us that are not on speaking terms with binary code.</p>

      <p>DecoderPro attempts to help overcome the inevitable
      complexity of this system by providing a clear, usable, user
      friendly <span class="ACCENT">open source</span> software
      solution for programming these on-board decoders. Programming
      panel designs are written in <b>XML</b>, (a close relative of
      HTML) and can be modified or even created from scratch by
      users with even a passing familiarity with the format without
      previous XML experience.</p>
