      <h1>Getting Started with DecoderPro&reg;</h1>

      <p>You will need, a means to connect between your computer
      and the track on which the locomotive rests, that will take
      serial instructions and generate DCC packets on the rails. At
      a minimum, a command station/booster (your DCC system will
      probably suffice), an additional hardware interface to send
      commands from your computer to the command station (this
      could be as simple as a serial cable), and a programming
      track set up according to the manufacturer's
      instructions.</p>

      <p>For some systems, you will also need an additional
      hardware interface to send the commands from your computer to
      the command station, and from there on to the decoder in the
      locomotive. For a Digitrax system, for example, you will need
      either the <strong>PR3 programmer</strong> or a
      <b>LocoBuffer</b>. The <b>PR1</b> device from Digitrax is a
      stand-alone programmer and is <span class="ACCENT">not</span>
      usable with this software.</p>

      <p>For those who do not have any DCC hardware yet and are
      considering purchasing a DCC locomotive and want to use
      DecoderPro to program it consider the SPROG II USB. It has
      all the electronics in one package with enough output to run
      a locomotive. It comes complete with the USB cable, power
      supply, instructions and JMRI on disk. All you need in
      addition, is the test track.</p>

      <p>You will also need, of course, some locomotives with the
      decoders installed which you can program.</p>
