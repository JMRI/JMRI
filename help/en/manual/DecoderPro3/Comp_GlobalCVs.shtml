      <p>For the hard-core programmer, this pane is a listing of the raw CV data by CV number, with
      data in <span class="ACCENT">decimal format</span>. You may change data by typing new numbers
      into the <strong>Values</strong> window. <strong>State</strong> shows the validity of the
      data, whether it was taken <strong>From file</strong> (the decoder information saved in the
      <strong>Roster</strong>), <strong>Edited</strong>, <strong>Read</strong> directly from the
      decoder, <strong>Stored</strong> to the decoder or if the status is <strong>Unknown</strong>.
      Note the <strong>scroll bar</strong> on the right side of the listings. You may scroll up or
      down to access all of the CV listings.</p>

      <h4>Decoder Locking</h4>

      <p>You tried to read a CV value and get "Error 308, No Acknowledgement from Decoder", well
      the decoder may be locked. CV 15 and 16 deal with locking, if your manufacturer implements
      this feature (and manufacturers have slight differences as to how they implement it). If the
      decoder is locked, then you will not be able to read data from it or write to it. To unlock
      the decoder, you must enter a value into CV15 (the only CV that can be written when the
      decoder is locked), that is equal to the value that is currently in CV16. Now I hear you
      thinking "but I can't read CV16 to know what to put into CV15". Well, you'll have to try all
      possible values, which isn't that hard since it can only have 8 possible values 0 thru 7.
      After each write, try to read CV16. It's the fastest read since it can only have 8 possible
      values. If JMRI responds with the no-ack error, then try the next value. If it returns the
      value in CV16, you've unlocked the decoder and you're in. If you have unsuccessfully tried
      all the 8 possibilities, then check your layout connection and the loco's wheels for poor
      connections and try again. Now you say, "I've looked thru the list several times and CV 15
      doesn't appear". That's on purpose, to minimize inadvertent locking by a Write All Sheets.
      You will have to use the <a href="Programmer_SingleCV.shtml">Single CV Programmer</a> to
      write CV15. It can be found in the Tools menu on the Main Page, under Programmers.</p>

      <p>If you have more than one decoder in your locomotive, you probably have a decoder locking
      scheme implemented to be able to access each one individually for programming.</p>

      <p>You may <strong>Read</strong> or <strong>Write</strong> individual CVs using the buttons
      in their row. On this page, a <strong>Read sheet</strong> or <strong>Write sheet</strong>
      operation is the same as a <strong>Read all</strong> or <strong>Write all</strong>.
      <span class="ACCENT">Again, a reminder: you can only read CVs if your command station has
      that capability.</span></p>

      <p>One thing to keep in mind about the <strong>CV</strong> listing on this pane - anything
      you can do here you can do from one of the other panes in DecoderPro, without having to know
      the <strong>CV</strong> number or how to compile the values to get the desired effect. This
      pane is meant for advanced users of DCC used to crunching the numbers themselves. Those new
      to DCC can safely ignore this panel without losing any capability at all.</p>
