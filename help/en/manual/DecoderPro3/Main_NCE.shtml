      <p><strong>Command Monitor</strong></p>

      <p>Opens the <a href=
      "Main_Monitor_Window.shtml">Communications Monitor Window</a>
      and automatically displays the information that is being sent
      and received on the communications link between your computer
      and your DCC system.</p>

      <p><strong>Send Command</strong></p>

      <p>Opens the <strong>Send</strong> prompt with a text box to
      enter the NCE Format command that you want to send.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Main_NCE_01.png" alt=
      "NCE Send" width="232" height="156" border="4"></p>

      <p><strong>Send Macro</strong></p>

      <p>Opens the <strong>Execute NCE Macro</strong> Window which
      allows you to enter the Macro number to be executed. Clicking
      the <strong>Send</strong> button sends the macro.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Main_NCE_02.png" alt=
      "NCE Macro Send" width="199" height="131" border="4"></p>

      <p><strong><a name="EditMacro" id="EditMacro"></a>Edit
      Macro</strong></p>

      <p>Open the <a href="#EditMacroWin">Edit NCE Macro</a>
      window.</p>

      <p><strong><a name="Editconsist" id="Editconsist"></a>Edit
      Consist</strong></p>

      <p>Opens the <a href="#Consist">Edit NCE Consist</a>
      window.</p>

      <p><strong>DCC Packet Analyzer</strong></p>

      <p>The DCC packet analyzer entry is software to log data from
      a hardware device sold by NCE which allows the user to
      observe the packets on the NCE Command Bus, or alternatively
      directly from the track. The latter feature allows the device
      to look at track packets sent from any Command Station that
      conforms to the NMRA standard (such as Digitrax or Lenz). The
      input signal is interpreted and sent to JMRI through a serial
      interface. With it the user can see speed and function
      instructions being sent from the Command Station to the
      decoder</p>

      <p><strong><a name="Clock" id="Clock"></a>Monitor
      Clock</strong></p>

      <p>Opens the <a href="#ClockMon">NCE Clock Monitor</a>
      window. When the clock is running as clock master mode, the
      internal clock rate is adjusted to match time with the NCE
      command station clock. The goal is the minute should roll
      over at the same time for the internal clock and ProCab
      displays.</p>

      <p><strong>Show Cabs</strong></p>

      <p><br>
      Opens a window that displays the cabs currently on the
      system. This is handy for determining the cab number assigned
      to a throttle that doesn't have a display. Just use "Show
      Cabs" to display the cabs currently on the system. Then plug
      in the cab in question and use it again to see which one is
      added. If you have a standalone setup bench it's even
      easier. Cycle the power to clear the command station memory.
      Then plug in the new cab and Show Cabs will display its
      number</p>

      <p><strong>Booster Programming</strong></p>

      <p>Booster Programming is stated to be only for NCE booster
      testing, and warns that the booster must be disconnected from
      the track before using.</p>

      Macro Window</h4>

      <p>This tool allows you to review, edit and save NCE style
      macros. It also allows you to backup and restore all the NCE
      command station macros to and from a file. The file format is
      identical to NCE, so you can restore a file that was
      generated by the NCE backup command. It is recommended that
      you set the baud rate at 9600 when using this tool.</p>
