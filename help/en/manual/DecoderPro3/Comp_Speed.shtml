      <p>The <strong>Speed Control pane</strong> looks very complicated, but it can be one of the
      most significant in improving the performance of your locomotive fleet. Remember if you use
      <strong>Speed Table</strong> TAB this TAB is not used.</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_Main.png" alt="speed" height="386" width="804">
      </h1>

      <p>Let's look first at the top of the pane: You now have the option of using Basic Speed
      Control (this pane) or Speed Table to control your locomotive's speed. Use the tabs at the
      top of the screen to select the method you wish to use and then click the button in the top
      center for the page to select that method of speed control. Whichever one you select last
      with the button will be the method used for speed control.</p>

      <p>Now back to Basic Speed Control Pane. We see the <strong>Start Voltage(0-255)</strong>
      slider to set the start voltage. What appears in the body of this panel is dependent on what
      is available from your decoder manufacturer. Most have something similar to what is shown,
      but the Soundtraxx Tsunami series is very limited. We'll show you a way around this
      limitation when we get to the Speed Table screen.</p>

      <p>Three important CVs are programmed in this pane Vstart, Vmid and Vhigh. They work together
      to make a very basic three point speed table. On some decoders these settings may be labeled
      differently and all three may not be available. DecoderPro will show the correct options for
      your selected decoder.</p>

      <p>Possible setting that can appear on this TAB.</p>

      <p><strong>Vstart</strong>(<strong>Start Voltage</strong>) is the voltage at the first speed
      step. If your locomotive didn't start moving until there were three volts on the track with
      analog power, this lets you set up the decoder to give it 2.99 volts right away, so it will
      start moving when you advance your DCC throttle.</p>

      <p><strong>Vhigh(Top Voltage, Max Voltage, Maximum Voltage)</strong> is the maximum amount of
      power the locomotive will get from the decoder. If your locomotive looks like Chuck Yeager's
      X-1 at full throttle, then you can trim the top speed down to a more reasonable scale level.
      A similar looking limit can be set on the Roster Entry screen, but it only apples to JMRI
      Throttles.</p>

      <p><strong>Vmid</strong>(<strong>Mid Voltage, Midpoint Voltage)</strong> lets you configure
      the slope between <strong>Vstart</strong> and <strong>Vhigh</strong> a bit, so that if your
      locomotive reaches full speed at 5 volts, you can stretch out the lower end of the curve to
      get more fine control in a useful speed range.</p>

      <p>If you are having problems with unpredictable speeds with your locomotives, check these
      settings. Sometimes, one or more of these settings have been changed accidentally (usually
      due to an error in programming CV's with a throttle), leading to very odd speed performance.
      In particular, if the <strong>Vmid</strong> is lower than <strong>Vstart</strong> or higher
      than <strong>Vhigh</strong>, results can be highly unpredictable. DecoderPro will not let you
      make this mistake.</p>

      <p><strong>Forward Trim</strong> and <strong>Reverse Trim</strong> allow you to compensate
      for differences in the forward speed and reverse speed of the locomotive. Most model
      locomotives do not run at exactly the same speed forward and backward due to the motor
      mechanics and the gear train to the wheels.</p>

      <p>The settings for these controls are not as intuitive as you might think. A setting of 0 in
      these CVs turns them off. However, a setting of 128 in either of them will have no visible
      effect! To make the forward and reverse trim effective, raise the value above 128 to increase
      speed, and lower it below 128 to decrease speed in this pane. The Forward and Reverse Trim
      does not work the same for all decoders, with variations between manufacturers.</p>

        <h3>Some suggestions on using the basic motor controls and programming on the
        main.<br></h3>

        <p>Unless you want to get into some precision speed matching, you probably won't need to
        use the <strong>Speed Tables</strong> you'll see on the <a href="Comp_Speed_Talble.shtml"
        target="_parent"><strong>Speed Table pane</strong></a>- you'll be able to accomplish much
        of what you want using just <strong>Kick start</strong> (<a href=
        "Comp_Motor.shtml">previous pane</a>), and <strong>Start Volts</strong>, <strong>Mid
        Volts</strong>, and <strong>Max Volts</strong> if they are available in this pane... but
        how to do this?</p>

        <p>Start with the <strong>Kick start</strong> value, and <a href=
        "Programmer_OpsMode.shtml">Programming on the main</a> rather than the programming track.
        Set the locomotive to be programmed on throttle step 1. If it moves <span class="ACCENT">at
        all</span>, don't change the <strong>Kick start</strong> value. If it doesn't move, slowly
        step up the throttle until it does. Then, turn the throttle down. If the locomotive stops
        at the same setting it started, you won't need to set the <strong>Kick start</strong>
        value. However, if it continues to run at a slower speed than it would start, then increase
        the <strong>Kick start</strong> value until it will start and run at its slowest possible
        speed.</p>

        <p>Now, if the locomotive isn't running at throttle step 1, increase the <strong>Start
        Volts</strong> value (and write it) without changing the throttle until the locomotive
        <span class="ACCENT">barely</span> crawls... you can usually get this down to a speed of a
        tie a minute or so if you like! Remember, you are doing this in "<strong>ops
        mode</strong>", so you can make these changes while the locomotive is actually running.
        Don't forget to write the value changes to the decoder - they won't take effect unless you
        do.</p>

        <p>Now, set the top speed of the locomotive. Run the throttle up to full, and lower the
        <strong>Max Volts</strong> value (and write it) until the locomotive runs at the maximum
        speed you want it to reach, but don't forget that adding a train will slow it down!</p>

        <p>Finally, set the <strong>Mid Volts</strong> value about half-way between <strong>Start
        Volts</strong> and <strong>Max Volts</strong>. Setting it above or below the median of the
        <strong>Start Volts</strong> and <strong>Max Volts</strong> values will give you a crude,
        three point speed table.</p>

        <p>There are no hard and fast rules for the exact numbers to use. Even identical
        locomotives with identical decoders will need different numbers, due to variances in motors
        and drive trains. Experiment with the settings - DecoderPro makes it easy!</p>

        <p>Note: Not all decoders will have Start, Mid and Max Volts, but will have some version of
        this which will be displayed by DecoderPro for the specific decoder.</p>
