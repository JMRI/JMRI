      <hr>

      <p>Prior to using the programmer you need to have completed
      the previous section (<a href="Start_DCC.shtml">Getting
      Started</a>), have your computer connected to your command
      station/booster with the required interface device for your
      DCC system, you are now ready to actually program a decoder
      that has been installed in your locomotive.</p>

      <p><br>
      On your initial opening DecoderPro, the main page will be
      displayed: (After preferences are set) The list of
      locomotives programmed by DecoderPro will be blank until you
      add a locomotive. From then on when it is opened a list of
      all the locomotives whose decoders you have previously
      programmed in DecoderPro3 or classic DecoderPro will be
      listed.</p>

      <p>DecoderPro provides access to the JMRI tools required to
      program DCC decoders. If you are an advanced user, using
      PanelPro to run your layout, then you may start PanelPro and
      then from the File menu start DecoderPro.</p>

      <p>If you already have roster entries and you want to start
      programming in <strong><a href=
      "Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">Comprehensive
      Programmer</a></strong>, double-click on the roster
      entry.</p>

      <p>DecoderPro by its self may program DCC decoders and also
      use the other JMRI tools to manually operate your trains from
      the computer interface. These include throttle control and
      power control of your layout if your DCC system allows
      them.</p>

      <p>The DecoderPro window is divided into five main section
      from top to bottom.</p>

      <div align="center">
        <img style="width: 900px; height: 425px;" alt="Main window"

      </div>

      <p>1<a href="dp3_menubar.shtml">. <strong>The Menu
      Bar</strong>.</a><br>
      2. <strong><a href="dp3_toobar.shtml">The Tool
      Bar</a></strong><br>
      3. <a href="dp3_rosterTable.shtml"><strong>The Roster
      Table</strong></a> a list of all the decoders in your roster
      that are part of the active roster group. To set up a roster
      group in addition to the default group of <strong>All
      Entries</strong> see <strong><a href=
      "dp3_settings_rosterGroups.shtml">Settings for Roster
      groups.</a></strong>.<br>
      4. <strong><a href="dp3_decoderInfo.shtml">The Decoder

      selected locomotive in the roster list.<br>
      5. A status bar that reports information about DecoderPro
      operation including errors.</p>

      <p>Anywhere in the roster table you may right-click and a
      context menu will be displayed.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style=

            <td>Deletes roster entry.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>At this time a new user will have no entries in the Roster
      list of locomotives. If you are updating program and have a
      Roster installed the Roster list will be populated as shown.
      We can now add a locomotive to the list.</p>

      <h4><strong><a name="newloco" id="newloco"></a>Adding a New
      Locomotive</strong></h4>

      <p>On the Tool Bar is an icon labeled <strong>New
      Loco</strong>. Click on the icon and the <strong>Create New
      Loco</strong> pane opens. Place a locomotive (with the
      decoder installed) on the Programming Track (Service Mode),
      click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Read type from
      decoder</span> button (at the bottom of the window)</p>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img style="width: 521px; height: 594px;" alt=
        "create new loco" src="images/dp3_createnewloco.png"><br>
      </div>

      <p>As in the screen below several possible decoders will
      probably be highlighted. This happens because the decoders
      are electrically the same but are packaged differently to fit
      the locomotives that they are used in. If you know which
      decoder is in use, then select that one. If not, in most
      cases any of the highlighted decoders will work, and you
      should select the one with the least letters at the end,
      since letters are often used to denote locomotive specific
      variations. Note all of the Tsunami decoders are using the
      same hardware in different configurations.</p>

      <p><img style="width: 556px; height: 594px;" alt=
      "select decoder type all" src=
      "images/dp3_createNewLoco_typeAll.png"></p>

      <p>I know that this decoder is an Athearn N Scale FP-45
      factory installed Tsunami Diesel Genesis OEM decoder. So I
      will select that decoder from the list.</p>

      <p><img style="width: 556px; height: 594px;" alt=
      "decoder ltype" src=
      "images/dp3_createnewloco_type.png"><br></p>

      <p>Note that we have selected a decoder, which is
      highlighted. Also the <strong>Open Comprehensive
      Programmer</strong> button is activated to allow us to enter
      the programmer.</p>

      <p>Click on the <strong>Open Comprehensive
      Programmer</strong> button and the <strong>Roster
      Entry</strong> Pane will open for the Selected Programmer. Go
      to the next page</p>
