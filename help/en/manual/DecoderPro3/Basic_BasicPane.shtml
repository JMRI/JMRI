      </div>
      <hr>

      <p>You may have noticed that at the top of the window are Two
      tabs: <strong>Roster Entry</strong> and
      <strong>Basic</strong>. We have completed the <strong>Roster
      Entry</strong> pane of the Program window, now, click on the
      <strong>Basic</strong> tab to change panes to continue with
      programming your decoder. The <strong>Basic</strong> pane
      will be displayed and look similar to the following
      illustration: Many panes in the programmer contain decoder
      dependent features, as a result what you see may not exactly
      agree with what you see here. Only those variables that your
      decoder can implement will be shown.</p>

      <p>Below is a screen for OEM decoder that is used in the
      <strong>Athearn FP-45</strong> locomotive.shown in factory
      settings, which is normally address 3<br>
      .<img src="images/Basic_Program.png" alt="basic pane" height=
      "557" width="642"></p>

      <div align="center"></div>

      <p>You will see three options you can change, highlighted in
      yellow:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The decoder address (should be unique among your
        locomotives, unless you are operating several as a set)
        often the locomotive number is used.</li>

        <li>Two radio buttons that let you toggle between 2 digit
        (one byte, "Normal") or 4 digit<br>
        (two byte, "Extended") addressing</li>

        <li>Analog operation (enables the decoder to run under
        regular DC voltage/analog<br>
        control) Enable Analog Operation with caution, as some
        decoders will jump to full speed resulting in a "Runaway
        locomotive" if they are enabled for Analog Operation and
        encounter power spikes on a DCC digital signal. They seem
        to get confused, and revert to Analog operation and use the
        full track voltage DCC power to take off and GO! There is
        no stopping them without removing layout power. Very
        disturbing to your operating mates, but better than running
        into them at full tilt.</li>
      </ol>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>To enable Analog (old style DC, some vendors refer to
        this as dual mode) Operation select the appropriate entry
        from the drop-down list.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The yellow highlighting indicates these options are
      "probable" settings and have not been confirmed from the
      decoder. Settings that have been changed by the user and have
      not been written back to the decoder appear in a orange
      color. You will see examples of<br>
      this throughout the manual.</p><a name="ReadData" id=
      "ReadData"></a> To read the actual settings for these options
      (and IF your system and installed decoder will allow readback
      of decoder values), click on the <strong><input name="button"
      id="button" value="Read full sheet" type="button"></strong> .
      The individual settings will turn red while they are in the
      process of being read (clever, eh?), and will turn white once
      the values have been read successfully from the decoder. Once
      again, DecoderPro must play "Twenty Questions" to get this
      information, and sometimes even has to ask a couple of times.

      <p>Be patient, especially with older computers. At the very
      bottom of the pane (where it says "idle") you will see a
      running account of exactly what DecoderPro is doing, for
      example, the specific CV being read.</p>

      <p>Again, the <input name="button2" id="button2" value=
      "Read full sheet" type="button"> and <strong><input name=
      "button3" id="button3" value="Read all sheets" type=
      "button"></strong> functions are dependent on your command
      station. If your system does not have the capability to read
      CVs, then these buttons will not be available.</p>

      <p><a name="EnterEditData" id="EnterEditData"></a>If you wish
      to change the address of the locomotive, type in the new
      address. To turn on or off 4 digit addressing, select the
      desired radio button. . Be sure that the address type agrees
      with the number of characters in the address.</p>

      <p>When you are finished, click on <input name="button4" id=
      "button4" value="Write full sheet" type="button"> to write
      the new values in the decoder.</p>

      <p><a name="WriteData" id="WriteData"></a>Writing usually
      takes much less time than reading, because the value can be
      sent directly. As the write operation proceeds, the data will
      change from yellow to white. If there is difficulty writing
      to the decoder, the data will change to red. The software
      will automatically keep trying until the write operation is
      successful. In some instances the system will "time-out"
      after a certain number of tries without an acknowledgement
      from the decoder. This does not necessarily mean that the
      values have not been written, just that the program has not
      received an acknowledgement. This can be due to the
      locomotive moving and getting on dirty track so that it can't
      pulse back, or possibly because the command station or
      decoder cannot read back. Try moving the loco and try again.
      If it is a command station or decoder read-back issue, try
      the loco on the mainline and see if the programming was
      successful.</p>

      <p><a name="SaveData" id="SaveData"></a> To finish this
      "basic" programming of a decoder, click once more on the
      <strong>Roster Entry</strong> tab, You will see that the
      address field has now been filled in, so you can now click on
      the <strong><input name="button5" id="button5" value=
      "Save to roster" type="button"></strong> . Your new decoder
      settings have now been written not only to the decoder, but
      also saved to a computer file where they may be recalled in
      the future.</p>

      <p>I have programmed the address for this locomotive and
      clicked on the Write full sheet button to send the address to
      the command station to program the decoder. Note that the
      status line keeps you updated as to what is writing and
      should finish with OK, which is good or an error message
      which usually meant the write was not completed. All the
      entries are now in white color as they match the decoder.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Basic_Address.png" alt=
      "basic address" height="556" width="636"><br></p>

      <p>Now that we have entered the Roster data and set the
      desired address, lets return to DecoderPro Main window by
      closing the Programming window.</p>

      <p>Notice that we now have a list of all the locomotives
      programmed so far that are in our roster.</p>

      <p><img style="width: 900px; height: 425px;" alt="main" src=
      "images/Main_01b_main.png"><br></p>

      <p><a name="DoMore" id="DoMore"></a>What we've done so far is
      what is available in the Basic mode of programming in
      DecoderPro. Which is basically put Locomotive in the roster
      and assign an address. A good place to start for new folks or
      at a club. It's hard to go wrong, but you can change the loco
      address and add it the roster, which are the two most often
      needed actions with programming.<br>
      <br>
      The classic DecoderPro offered a number of modes, most of
      which were often redundant and confusing showing how the user
      could edit the underlying file to make special application
      programming modes. The Comprehensive Programmer was the most
      popular for a long time until Advanced came along with added
      features. So now they've been combined in DecoderPro. Thus
      the Comprehensive Programmer with added Advanced features is
      the only other programmer that DecoderPro offers.<br>
      Since we've already covered <strong>Basic</strong>, let's
      explore the DecoderPro <a href=
      "Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">Comprehensive Programmer</a>!</p>

      <p>Select the Locomotive that you want to program in
      Comprehensive Programmer, then double click on selection to
      open Programmer.</p>

      <p>At the bottom of the window is the <a href=
      "RosterMedia.shtml">Labels &amp; Media</a> and<a href=
      "dp3_Main_Throttle.shtml">Throttle</a> buttons. Use these
      buttons to set up the Icon photos for your roster entries and
      to set up the Function Labels on the software throttle
      included in JMRI. Click the links that we've included and
      take a look.</p>
