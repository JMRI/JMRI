      <h2>Motor Control Pane</h2>

      <p><strong>Motor</strong> control is divided into three
      separate panes. The <strong>Motor Control pane</strong> deals
      with CV's for simulating locomotive weight or inertia. The
      <a href="Comp_Speed.shtml" target="_parent"><strong>Basic
      Speed Control pane</strong></a><a href="Comp_Basic.shtml"
      target="_parent"></a> deals with basic motor control CV's and
      the third <a href="Comp_Speed_Talble.shtml" target=
      "_parent"><strong>Speed Table pane</strong></a> covers those
      dealing with the <strong>Speed Table</strong> method of
      controlling the motor. These last two methods of motor
      control are mutually exclusive. The selection is made with a
      radio button at the top of each of those two panes. The
      default selection is <strong>Basic Speed
      Control.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>The Motor Pane</strong></p>

      <p>The contents of the Motor pane will vary significantly
      between different brands and models of decoders. In the case
      of the decoder shown in the illustration:</p>

      <p><strong>Acceleration Rate</strong> and
      <strong>Deceleration Rate</strong> help simulate a locomotive
      under load - but don't use them unless you have very clean
      track, because an interruption of power can make a locomotive
      stop and cycle through the acceleration curve again! On the
      latest Tsunami Diesel sound decoders the firmware has been
      changed. The decoder now returns to the last speed setting
      before the power interruption but it has no knowledge of
      where it was in the acceleration curve. So if you have been
      in the habit of using lots of momentum and setting speed to
      maximum to get the sound of a notch 8 motor, be aware that if
      the loco loses power for just an instant from a dirt spot on
      the rails, it will resume at the top speed step and appear to
      be running away.</p>

      <p>High deceleration rates can make station stops and
      switching realistic, but very challenging!</p>

      <p><strong>Back EMF</strong> or <strong>Speed
      stabilization</strong> is implemented differently by each
      manufacturer.. See your decoder documentation for the best
      ways to implement these variables, and be prepared to do a
      lot of experimenting! However they do it and whatever they
      call it, you should find it in this pane.</p>
