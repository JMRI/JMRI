      <p>Three types of consists are used on DCC systems:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A <strong><em>basic</em></strong> or <strong><em>primary address consist</em></strong>,
        where each locomotive is assigned the same address on the programming track, or on the main
        with <a href="Programmer_OpsMode.shtml"><strong>OpsMode Programming</strong></a> (if
        supported by the command station and decoder).<br>
          <br>
        </li>

        <li>A <strong><em>Command Station Assisted Consist</em></strong> (CSAC) which builds the
        consist using a function of your command station. Command Station Assisted Consists go by
        the trade names listed below.<br>
          <br>

          <table>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Manufacturer</strong>
                </td>
                <td><strong>Trade Name</strong>
                </td>
                <td><strong>Usage Notes</strong>
                </td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Digitrax</td>
                <td>Universal Consist</td>
                <td>Limited to the number of slots supported by the system. Allows any address</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Lenz</td>
                <td>Double Header</td>
                <td>Limited to 2 locomotives. Allows any address but 00 to be used</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>NCE</td>
                <td>Old Style Consist</td>
                <td>Limited to 8 locomotives. Allows any address but 00 to be used</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>EasyDCC</td>
                <td>Standard Consist</td>
                <td>Limited to 8 locomotives. Allows any address but 00 to be used</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <br>
        </li>

        <li>A <em><strong>Decoder Assisted Consist (</strong></em>DAC), often referred to as
        Advanced Consist. The NMRA<sup>&reg;</sup> has set aside CV19 as a dedicated location for
        consist addresses. If CV19 contains a value other than 0, the locomotive will respond to
        speed and direction instructions sent to the address in CV19. If CV19 contains zero then it
        will respond to speed and direction commands sent to the usual short or long decoder
        address. Since the consist address is a single CV, it is limited to the range of 1 to 127.
        If you add 128 to the consist address, the locomotive will run backwards (relative to it's
        normal direction of travel) in the consist. The DAC can be set up in the <a href=
        "Comp_Consist.shtml"><strong>Consisting</strong></a> tab in the Comprehensive Programmer.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>DecoderPro Consisting Tool</h4>

      <p>The consist tool provides a visual tool for manipulating the <em><strong>Decoder Assisted
      Consists</strong></em> and , on some command stations, <em><strong>Command Station Assisted
      Consists.</strong></em></p>

      <p class="dp-center"><img style="width: 691px; height: 282px;" alt="consist" src=
      "images/Main_consist_01.png"><br>
      </p>

      <p>The <input name="radio" id="radio" value="radio" checked="checked" type="radio">
      <strong>Advanced Consist</strong> and the <input name="radio2" id="radio2" value="radio2"
      type="radio"> <strong>Command Station Consist</strong> allow you to select either consisting
      mode if supported by your command station. If not supported the options will be grayed
      out.</p>

      <p><strong>Consist</strong> text box: type the consist ID assigned to the locomotives in the
      consist for <em><strong>Decoder Assisted Consists.</strong></em> For Command Station Consist,
      this is automatically filled in with the address of the lead locomotive in the consist.</p>

      <p><strong>New Locomotive</strong> text box : type in a new locomotive address or select from
      you roster using the drop-down list.</p>

      <p>The <input name="checkbox" id="checkbox" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
      <strong>Direction Normal ?</strong> determines the direction of the locomotive travel as
      forwarded or reverse when the consist is traveling forward. Will be grayed out until the lead
      locomotive is selected.</p>

      <p>The <strong>add</strong> button adds the locomotive to the consist.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 691px; height: 282px;" alt="consist" src=
      "images/Main_consist_02.png">
      </p>

      <p>The <strong>reset</strong> buttton removes alll data for the locomotive.</p>

      <p><strong><input name="button3" id="button3" value="DEL" type="button"></strong> removes the
      consist. The list of the consist will have a <input name="button4" id="button4" value="DEL"
      type="button"> for each locomotive, allowing you to remove any locomotive from the
      consist.</p>

      <p><input name="button6" id="button6" value="Delelte" type="button"> deletes the entire
      consist.</p>

      <p><a href="dp3_Main_Throttle.shtml"><input name="button5" id="button5" value="Throttle"
      type="button"></a> opens a <strong><a href="dp3_Main_Throttle.shtml">throttle</a></strong>
      for the consist. Each time that yoiu select throttle the locomotive will be added to the
      consist.</p>

      <p><input name="button7" id="button7" value="Reverse" type="button"> reverses the direction
      of the consist.</p>
