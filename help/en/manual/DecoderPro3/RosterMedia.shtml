      <p>The Roster Media Pane is opened from the DecoderPro button in main window or from the
      Action menu, then select the Roster Media TAB.</p>

      <p>The Roster Media Pane allows you to add a main image and an icon to the engines roster.
      The main image may be used for Throttle background image if selected in the Throttle
      preferences. The icon image is used in the Throttle list and various roster combo boxes.</p>

      <p>The icon is the image that will appear in the Decoder Information part of the DecoderPro
      initial screen, once you have selected a locomotive from the list. The icon will also display
      in the icon column of the Locomotive Roster List.</p>
