      <h1>The Basic Programmer</h1>

      <h2>The Roster Entry Pane</h2>

      <div align="right">

      </div>
      <hr>

      <p>The Basic Programmer uses only the required panes to set
      up the decoder for DCC operation and creating a Roster entry
      and uses only the first two TABs. The first action in
      programming a locomotive with DecoderPro&reg; is to fill out
      the roster entry screen.</p>

      <p>A <b>roster</b> is a database of all locomotives that your
      installation of DecoderPro has programmed. All of this
      information will be contained in the list on the DecoderPro
      main page. It includes the information seen in the screen
      below:</p>

      <div align="center">
        <img style="width: 642px; height: 602px;" alt=
        "Basic roster" src="images/Basic_Roster.png"><br>
      </div>

      <p>Most of these fields are self-explanatory. However, note
      that the first field (<strong>ID</strong>) becomes the file
      name in the Roster for the locomotive you are programming.
      Set up a schema to identify your locomotive to its decoder
      program. i.e. Mfr, Loco Type, and Address (Kato_SD40-2_5645).
      Spaces in the ID field will be changed to underscores (_)
      when the file is written. In a club environment, often the ID
      begins with the owner's name, or member number. This way the
      Roster (which is sorted alphabetically) will keep all of an
      owner's locomotives listed together. DecoderPro also allows
      you to categorize roster entries into Groups, so you could
      have a separate group for each member.</p>

      <p>We'll get to Groups and all the other neat stuff that can
      be done with DecoderPro in a while. I just thought I'd give
      you peek behind the curtain, and give you a chance to
      mentally thank the JMRI developers for all their work on
      DecoderPro version 3. Of course a message to that effect
      posted to the JMRI Users group would also be warmly
      received.<br>
      <br>
      The DCC address will be filled in automatically when we get
      to programming the address. The Decoder Family and Model are
      entered automatically from the Selection page we just used to
      get here.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Decoder</strong> <strong>Comment</strong>
      field is a good place to add the date you purchased the
      locomotive, price, or any other information you might feel is
      important to record.</p>

      <p>The <input name="SaveToRoster" value="Save to Roster"
      type="submit"> button stores the current decoder information
      to your computer hard drive and folder where your roster file
      is located. The default storage is the same directory where
      the program is installed.</p>

      <p>The <input name="button" id="button" value=
      "Reset to Defaults" type="submit"> button can be used to
      return the Roster file to the condition of a new file for the
      type and version of the decoder listed in the roster entry.
      It does NOT change the values in the roster file on your hard
      disk, unless you specifically save it after using this reset
      button. It also is not written to the decoder until you
      specifically select a write operation. It was included in
      DecoderPro so that if you get hopelessly confused in
      proceeding screen to screen entering variables, you can
      return to the decoder manufacturers baseline default set and
      start again.</p>

      <p><br>
      Most decoders will activate the <strong>Reset Menu</strong>
      (next to the File menu at the top of the page). This will
      reset the decoder to the manufacturers default settings for
      all the CVs, or just some of them if the manufacturer has
      several reset routines. It does this by writing directly to a
      CV in the decoder, if the decoder has that feature, CV8 in
      the case of Digitrax. All decoders may not support reset and
      how they work is manufacturer and decoder dependent.</p>

      <p><br>
      One decoder with a lengthy list of reset routines is the QSI
      Revolution decoder, which enables a drop-down list of options
      for resetting the decoder as shown below:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src=
      "images/FactoryReset.jpg" alt="Factory reset" height="557"
      width="638"></p>

      <p>You will note that the decoder address is shown but grayed
      out (or blank if this is a new locomotive in the roster).
      This field is automatically filled in by the program and is
      determined from the address entered using the
      <strong>Basic</strong> tab which we will get to shortly. This
      address is used with the <strong>Ident</strong> function on
      the start page if you wish to recall a locomotive that is
      already in your roster.</p>

      <p><a name="ProgramModes" id="ProgramModes"></a>The
      Programming mode can be changed by clicking on the drop down
      box</p>

      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/SetProgramMode.png" alt="set program mode"
        height="218" width="653">
      </div>

      <p>There are options for several <a href=
      "Basic_Mode.shtml"><strong>programming modes</strong></a>.
      JMRI now selects the best mode for you. It determines this
      from the command station type you are using and the decoder
      model you are attempting to program. Usually this will be OK.
      If you find that you are having a problem with programming
      you may try a different mode.</p>

      <p>For most newer decoders, stay with <strong>Paged
      mode</strong> or whichever Direct mode your Command Station
      supports. Your decoder documentation should let you know if
      programming in some other mode is necessary... but if you are
      having problems, experiment. If a mode is not supported for
      the selected decoder and system, that option will be grayed
      out. For this decoder I will use Direct Bye Mode.</p>

      <p>When you make your selection, the programming mode should
      now display to the left of the in the dropdown box.</p>

      <p>Below is a Basic Programming Roster setup for Athearn
      FP-45 locomotive in n scale with OEM decoder (Tsunami 750)
      decoder. Note in the status at the bottom of pane indicates
      that the file has been saved.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src=
      "images/Basic_Roster01.png" alt="roster" height="557" width=
      "642"></p>

      <p>Now that we have the Roster information all in order, we
      can continue with programming the decoder.</p>

      <p>Now it's time to click on the <strong>Save to
      Roster</strong> button to save this data. Note that there
      will be brief message in status bar at the bottom of the
      screen that roster has been saved.</p>

      <p>Let's move on to the Basic Programmer.</p>
