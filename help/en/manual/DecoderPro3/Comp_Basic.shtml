      <p>One of the first things you will notice about the expanded
      <strong>Basic</strong> Pane in the <strong>Comprehensive
      Programmer</strong> is that there are a lot more options than
      you found in the <strong>Basic Programmer</strong>. Now use
      the Read full sheet button to read the values that the
      locomotive is programmed to. Now you can determine if you
      want to change any values.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style=
      "width: 903px; height: 582px;" alt="Extended Basic" src=
      "images/Extended_Basic_Program_Roster.png"><br></p>

      <p>Select 2 or 4 digit <b>addressing</b> radio button to
      select which mode of addressing you wish to be active</p>

      <p>You can enter locomotive addresses in both the
      <strong>Primary address</strong> and/or the <strong>Extended
      address</strong>. The address of a decoder is the prefix for
      the code it responds to. This is how you are able to run
      multiple locomotives on a single line and keep all their
      speeds and functions independent. Decoders originally could
      have only a two digit address... after all, who could
      possibly need more than 100 locomotives? Some lower-end
      command stations and decoders still use only two digit
      addressing. Newer decoders can have up to a four digit
      address. The "<b>Addressing Mode</b>" option lets you choose
      between two and four digit addresses. The addresses
      themselves are input into the appropriate text boxes. The
      "<b>Extended Addressing</b>" check box turns on and off the 4
      digit address mode. This allows you to have two different
      addresses stored in a decoder, and toggle between the
      two.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal direction of motion</strong>: Set the
      <strong>Locomotive direction: normal</strong> or
      <strong>reverse</strong> from the drop-down list. The option
      for <b>Normal direction of movement</b> is important for
      people who model railroads like the NS, who ran diesel
      locomotives long hood forward, or for the person who
      occasionally makes a mistake and hooks the decoder up in
      reverse. It lets you change the direction defined in the
      decoder as "forward" (no disassembling and rewiring).</p>

      <p><strong>Speed Steps:</strong> Unless your command station
      or decoder can only handle 14 speed steps,choose the 28/128
      setting. If your decoder offers 128 speed step operation,
      you'll find you get much finer control of your locomotives by
      using the <strong>128 speed steps</strong> setting. You
      choose between 128 or 28 with your throttle, when the
      locomotive is ready to roll on the track.</p>

      <p><strong>Analog operation</strong> (enables the decoder to
      run under regular DC voltage/analog<br>
      control) Enable Analog Operation with caution, as some
      decoders will jump to full speed resulting in a "Runaway
      locomotive" if they are enabled for Analog Operation and
      encounter power spikes on a DCC digital signal. They seem to
      get confused, and revert to Analog operation and use the full
      track voltage DCC power to take off and GO! There is no
      stopping them without removing layout power. Very disturbing
      to your operating mates, but better than running into them at
      full tilt.</p>

      <p>To enable Analog (old style DC, some vendors refer to this
      as dual mode) Operation select the appropriate entry from the
      drop-down list.</p>

      <p><strong>User ID #1</strong>" and <strong>User ID
      #2</strong> (off to the right} there are two CVs that have
      nothing to do with any function of the decoder. They simply
      provide you with a method of electronically marking your
      equipment. Use these CVs, even though you may have
      custom-painted equipment for your own freelanced railroad -
      it provides one more way to identify your decoders if they
      are removed from the loco.</p>

      <div align="right"></div>

      <h2>The Read and Write Buttons</h2>

      <p>At the bottom of all the programmer panes you will find
      three rows of buttons, as shown :</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Comp_03_Basic.png" alt=
      "comp basic buttons" height="168" width="929"></p>

      <p>The top row operates <span class=
      "ACCENT"><strong>ONLY</strong></span> on the currently
      visible pane. These buttons are:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Read changes on sheet</b> - an "Oops!" button that
        lets you recover data from the decoder if you've changed it
        accidentally on the computer (and don't remember what the
        values were!), but only if you haven't written it yet.</li>

        <li><b>Write changes on sheet</b> - faster than writing all
        the data on the sheet, and ideal for tweaking changes in
        <b>Ops mode</b>, programming on the main track.</li>

        <li><b>Read full sheet</b> - read all data in this pane
        from the decoder. Note this may take a great deal of time,
        depending upon the speed of your computer and the
        controller station in use.</li>

        <li><b>Write full sheet</b> - writes all data in this pane
        to the decoder.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The second row of buttons performs essentially the same
      functions, but on the <strong>entire range</strong> of CVs
      for the decoder. This allows you to read all CVs, for
      example, or to make a series of changes across several panes,
      and when done then write them all to the decoder. Again, you
      have the option of reading/writing only the changed data, or
      all data.</p>

      <p>Below the two rows of buttons is a text line that shows
      what the current <b>programming mode</b> setting, and a
      <b>Set</b><strong>...</strong> button that allows you to
      change it without exiting the programmer. <a href=
      "Basic_Mode.shtml"><strong>click here</strong></a> for
      further information on Programming Modes.</p>

      <p>Finally, the bottom line of the pane is a status bar that
      tells you exactly what the system is doing. It shows
      <strong>idle</strong> in these screen shots because the
      system was not actively programming decoders when they were
      made.</p>

      <p>Now Lets go to the Motor Tab.</p>
