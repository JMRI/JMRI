      <strong>Programming On Main</strong> and press
      <strong>Program</strong>.</p>

      <p><b>Operations Mode (Main Track) Programmer</b> - or
      <strong>Programming on the main(POM)</strong>. Opens the
      <strong>Operations Mode (Main Track)</strong> windowThis lets
      you program a specific decoder on the layout, even while it
      is operating. However, because it addresses a specific
      decoder address, some decoders will not allow you to change
      the decoder's address using this method!</p>

      <p>Some command stations will only "broadcast" programming
      commands, which can mean every locomotive on the layout gets
      the same programming! The same is true if you try to program
      a loco with address zero (or forget to enter an address when
      you start). If in doubt, check your documentation.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Reading from your Decoder on the main:</strong><br>
        <br>
        With a few exceptions it is not possible to read from a CV
        on the Main. If reading fails it usually reports as a 306
        error (Timeout Talking to Command Station.)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Writing to your decoder on the main:</strong><br>
        <br>
        Program on the Main writes are often called a "blind write"
        because there is no response from the decoder that the
        write was successful. POM is very useful for tuning loco
        performance while it is operating and the ack is the change
        in performance.<br>
        The decoder is first addressed by the Command Station, then
        the CV is addressed and then the data that is to be written
        into that CV of that decoder is sent. An exception is if
        address zero is used,(or you forget to enter an address
        when you start). Then <strong>ALL</strong> decoders on the
        main will write that data into the appropriate CV which
        usually is an "unintended consequence".

      <p>Some command stations will only "broadcast" programming
      commands, which can mean every locomotive on the layout gets
      the same programming! If in doubt, check your
      documentation.</p>

      <p>In this window you select the locomotive in which you wish
      to change CV values, and what programmer you want to use.
      Once they are selected you click <strong>Open
      Programmer</strong> button just as you would do in the
      <strong>Service Mode programmer</strong>.</p>
