<p>Motor  control is divided into three separate panes.&nbsp;  The<strong> Motor Control pane</strong> deals with CV&#8217;s for simulating locomotive weight or  inertia.&nbsp; The <a href="Comp_Speed.shtml" target="_parent"><strong>Basic Speed Control pane</strong></a><a href="Comp_Basic.shtml" target="_parent"></a> deals with basic  motor control CV&#8217;s and the third <a href="Comp_Speed_Talble.shtml" target="_parent"><strong>Speed Table pane</strong></a><a href="Comp_Speed.shtml" target="_parent"></a>
covers those dealing with the Speed Table method of controlling the
motor.&nbsp; These last two methods of motor control are mutually
exclusive.&nbsp; The selection is made with a radio button at the top
of each of those two panes.&nbsp; The default selection is Basic Speed
Control.
</p><p><strong>The  Motor Pane </strong></p>
<h1><img style="width: 801px; height: 372px;" alt="motor" src="images/Comp_03_Motor.png"><br></h1>

<p>The contents of the Motor pane will vary significantly between
different brands and models of decoders. In the case of the decoder
shown in the illustration:</p>

<p><strong>Acceleration Rate</strong> and <strong>Deceleration  Rate </strong>
help simulate a locomotive under load - but don't use them unless you
have very clean track, because an interruption of power can make a
locomotive stop and cycle through the acceleration curve again! On the
latest Tsunami Diesel sound decoders the firmware has been changed. The
decoder now returns to the last speed setting before the power
interruption but it has no knowledge of where it was in the
acceleration curve.&nbsp; So if you have been in the habit of using
lots of momentum and setting speed to maximum to get the sound of a
notch 8 motor, be aware that if the loco loses power for just an
instant from a dirt spot on the rails, it will resume at the top speed
step and appear to be running away. </p>
<p>High  deceleration rates can make station stops and switching realistic, but very  challenging!</p>
<p><strong>Back EMF </strong>or <strong>Speed stabilization</strong> <strong>(BEMF)</strong>is implemented differently by  each manufacturer.. See your 
decoder documentation for the best ways to implement these variables,  and be prepared to 
do a lot of experimenting! However they do it and whatever they call it,  you should find it 
in this pane. </p>
