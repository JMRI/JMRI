    <p>The <strong>Roster Groups</strong> function  allows you to take your entire roster and categorize it.&nbsp; At home you might want to break it down by  diesel vs. steam, or by railroad.&nbsp; At a  club it would be handy to have categories by member name in addition to any  other category you might think of.&nbsp; A  roster entry can be associated with more than one group.&nbsp; Again in a club environment, a roster entry  could be associated with the Steam, Union Pacific and John Member groups all at  the same time. There is always one group  present and it is called Global.&nbsp; All the  roster entries are in the Global Group.&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;Once the  associations have been made, then you can select the Active Roster Group.&nbsp;  Once this is done then the Print and Print Summary actions will show only the  roster entries associated with that group.&nbsp; As an example you could select  the Group <strong>Santa Fe</strong> and only the roster entries in this Roster Group will  be printed.&nbsp; The printout does not currently show the active group in  the header.&nbsp;&nbsp; The active group will also influence any drop down  box which has a list of entries in it, such as Throttle, edit entry, copy,  etc.&nbsp; Also, when adding a new roster  entry it will automatically be associated with the currently active group, so  it is good practice when finishing working with a group to return the active  group to Global. </p>
  <h4><strong><em><br>
    Restoring Roster to include all Engines</em></strong></h4>
  <p>    To return your roster to  show all engines, <strong>Select  Roster Group</strong> to All Entries. Then you may be certain that you are  working with all engines in your  roster.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Disassociation of Roster Entry to Group</em></strong><br>
  </p>
  <p>To diassociate a roster entry to a Roster Group, open Roster Group Table and uncheck roster selection and save new Group by closing the Roster Group Table.</p>
