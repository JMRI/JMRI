<p>Opens a Windows <strong>Open</strong> dialog box to allow you to
select the file of your choice and a file that meets the criteria
defined herein. Note that the program will only add cars that don't
exist in the program's car roster. It the car already exists, the
import will be skipped by the program. You must also create the
locations and their tracks before importing the cars into the
operations program.</p>
<p>To improve the speed of the car import, you can close the <strong>Cars</strong>
window. It takes significantly more processor cycles to update the cars
panel than to actually import the cars. </p>
<p>After importing your cars, you must save them if you want to keep
them as part of your roster. Select any car by pressing the edit button
and then press the <input name="button" id="button" value="Save" type="submit">
that can be found at the bottom right of the <strong>Edit Car</strong>
window. </p>
<p>If you already have a list of cars in a database, you can import the
cars into the program. The import function requires an ACSII text file,
with one line for each car. The import order is car number, car road
name, car type, car length, car weight, car color. The following shows
two examples of the correct format: </p>
<p>336 GCR Flat 40 3.8 Black <br>
655578 UP Boxcar 40 3.8 Yellow</p>
<p>Each line can start with a space and multiple spaces between fields
is okay. Optionally you can include additional information in the
following order, owner name, date built, and location. The location can
have two fields, the location name followed by the location's siding or
yard name separated by a hyphen. The following shows two examples of
the correct format:</p>
<br>
336 GCR Flat 40 3.8 Black AT 1930 Home Town USA - George's Oil Terminal
<br>
655578 UP Boxcar 40 3.8 Yellow DB 1934 York - York Freight
<p>If you prefer to use comma delimiters instead of spaces, place the
word "comma" at the start of your import file and use commas instead of
spaces. The following are two examples of importing cars with comma
deliminters.</p>
<p>comma <br>
336,GCR,Flat Car,40,3.8,Black,AT,1930,Home Town USA,-,George's Oil
Terminal <br>
655578,UP,Tank Car,40,3.8,Yellow,DB,1934,York,-,York Freight</p>
<p>You need to be very careful with spaces when importing a comma
delimitated file. The program will include leading and trailing spaces
if they exist between the commas.</p>
