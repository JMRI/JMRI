<hr>
<p>If you would like to see cars delivered in a particular sequence, or
with a specific load for delivery or shipping, the program allows you
to apply a schedule to a siding. This is an optional feature and
shouldn't be used until you become very familiar with how the program
generates manifests and switch lists. A schedule provides very fine
control on the order types of cars will be delivered to a siding. You
can also specify the road name for the type of car delivered. For
example, if you wanted two SP boxcars to be delivered followed by a
tank car loaded with "Oil", you can create a schedule that will do
exactly that.</p>
<p><a name="Schedules"></a>You can also access your Schedules from the <a href="Ops_Locations.shtml">Locations window Tools menu</a>.
The Schedules table provides status for each schedule. Since you can
assign a schedule to multiple spurs, the table also provides additional
status for each of the spurs that use that particular schedule. The
table also allows you the edit a schedule once its been assigned to a
spur. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/Ops_Schedule07.png" alt="schedule" height="218" width="900"></p>
<p> </p>

<h4>Creating a Schedule</h4>
<p>First open the<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="Ops_Locations.shtml"> Locations&nbsp;</a> window.</p>


<p>Then press 
  <input name="button" id="button" value="Edit" type="submit"> 
in the column to the right of the location that you desire to schedule and the&nbsp; <strong>Edit Location </strong>window will &nbsp;open.</p><p><img src="images/Ops_Schedule02.png" alt="schedule" height="544" width="777"></p>
<p>To schedule a location, select 
  <input name="button2" id="button2" value="Edit" type="button"> in the column to the right to schedule the specific track at a location, then the&nbsp;<strong>Edit (Spur or other type of track) Track</strong> window will open.. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="90%">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="44%"><input name="schedule" id="schedule" src="images/Ops_Schedule03.png" type="image"></td>
    <td align="left" valign="top" width="56%"><p>Next to <strong>Optional Schedule</strong>
        <select name="select" id="select"></select>
on the <strong>Edit Siding Track</strong> panel. Press
<input name="button3" id="button3" value="Edit" type="submit">
should open the <strong>Add Schedule</strong> panel. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The <strong>Edit Schedule for <em>spur</em></strong>---- window opens if the schedule exists and you want to modify it. If no schedule is selected, then when 
  <input name="button8" id="button8" value="Edit" type="button"> 
is pressed the <strong>Add Schedule for <em>Spur</em>----</strong> window opens. </p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_Schedule04.png" alt="schedule" height="281" width="900"></p>
<p>The schedule can operate in two modes, sequential, if you want cars
in sequence. Use match mode when you do not care about car order.</p>
<p>Type  a <strong>Name </strong>for your schedule and then press
  <input name="button4" id="button4" value="Add Schedule" type="submit">
on the bottom of the panel. Multiple sidings can use the same  schedule as long as the sidings use the same car types and roads.</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_Schedule05.png" alt="schedule" height="281" width="900"></p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_Schedule05a.png" alt="schedule" height="281" width="900"></p>
<p> Now  add your first delivery for this siding by selecting a car type 
  <select name="select2" id="select2"><option>Boxcar</option></select>
then pressing 
<input name="button5" id="button5" value="Add car type" type="submit">
. A new item should appear in your schedule  containing the type of car,</p>
<p><img src="images/Ops_Schedule06.png" alt="schedule" height="281" width="900"></p>
<p> You can if you wish specify a particular road for the type of car
you entered, or leave it blank if you don't care about the road name.
You can also specify the car load received and shipped. Also a
Timetable may be specified. All with the use of the drop-down menus</p>
<p> If you wanted more than one car type to be delivered consecutively,
increase the count to the number that you wish. The maximum count is 10
and the minimum is 1. Repeat selecting the car types and pressing <input name="button6" id="button6" value="Add car type" type="submit">
until your have a delivery schedule you like. Press
<input name="button7" id="button7" value="Save Schedule" type="submit">
and close the schedule panel when you are done. </p>
<p>Note only car types and roads that are accepted by this siding are
available. If a car type or road isn't available, check the car types
and roads for this siding and location. </p>
<p>If you want a specific load for your cars,  you can create them using the <a href="Ops_CarAttributes.shtml">Edit Car  Attributes</a> for car <strong>Load</strong>.
Each new load is associated with the car type. For example you can have
"Screws" for a boxcar, and "Oil" for a tank car. The program will only
deliver cars with a "Schedule" load to a spur that has a Schedule that
also requests that particular load. However, cars with a Schedule load
can still be placed at yards, staging, and interchanges. </p>
<p>You can optionally use your staging tracks to empty cars with a
"Schedule" load, and you can also optionally create "Schedule" loads
using staging tracks. </p><hr>
