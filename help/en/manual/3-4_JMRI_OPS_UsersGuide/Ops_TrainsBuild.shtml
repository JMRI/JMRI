<p><strong>Switch Lists by Location</strong></p>
<p>A switch list shows the work required to service all of the trains
visiting that location. Normally a switch list is given to the person
in charge of a yard or a location with many spurs or industries.</p>
<p>To Preview or Print Switch Lists, select the location(s) and set printer, then press 
  <input name="button14" id="button14" value="Preview Switch Lists" type="button">
  or 
  <input name="button15" id="button15" value="Print Switch Lists" type="button">
  </p>
<p>
  <input name="button16" id="button16" value="Save" type="button">

<p><strong>Building Trains</strong></p>
<p>To build one train, press
  <input name="button17" id="button17" value="Build" type="submit">
  in the row for the desired  train in the <strong>Trains</strong> window. After the train is built
  <input name="button17" id="button18" value="Build" type="submit">
  changes to
  <input name="button18" id="button19" value="Print" type="submit"> 
  or 
  <input name="button52" id="button52" value="Preview" type="button">
  .</p><p>You may select the &nbsp;Action that you want to perform on &nbsp;all trains that are selected.</p><p><img style="width: 422px; height: 126px;" alt="action" src="images/Ops_Trains_action.png">
</p>
<p><img style="width: 1016px; height: 146px;" alt="Trains build" src="images/Ops_TrainsBuild01.png"><br></p>
<p>If you want to review how the train was built,  select the
  <input name="checkbox5" id="checkbox5" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
  <strong>Build Reports</strong> before pressing
  <input name="button19" id="button20" value="Preview" type="submit">
  for the desired train.&nbsp;</p><p><img style="width: 635px; height: 148px;" alt="trains build" src="images/Ops_trainsBuild03.png"></p><p>If the
  <input name="checkbox5" id="checkbox6" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
  <strong>Preview Manifest </strong>is  selected, the program will generate the build report and manifest and  present them in preview windows.</p>
<p><img style="width: 319px; height: 126px;" alt="trains build" src="images/Ops_TrainsBuild02.png"><br></p>
<p> If you want to build several trains without having to press
individual buttons for each train, select the trains that you want
built in the <strong>Build</strong> column
  <input name="checkbox5" id="checkbox7" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
  and press
  <input name="button20" id="button21" value="Build" type="submit">
  found at the  bottom of the trains panel. The program will then build manifests for  all of the selected trains. </p>
<p>If a train fails to build, the
  <input name="button21" id="button22" value="Move" type="submit">
  will change its text  to
  <input name="button22" id="button23" value="Report" type="submit">
  . Pressing
  <input name="button23" id="button24" value="Report" type="submit">
will print or preview the build report for this train. Whenever a train
fails to build, a build failure message will appear. If you want to
disable this feature deselect the checkbox <input name="checkbox5" id="checkbox8" type="checkbox">
  <strong>Build Messages</strong>.</p>
<p>With
  <input name="checkbox5" id="checkbox9" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
  <a href="Ops_ManifestPreview.shtml">Preview Manifest</a> press
  <input name="button24" id="button25" value="Preview" type="submit">
  and the Train Manifest is displayed using your system printer's preview window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With
  <input name="checkbox6" id="checkbox10" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
  <strong>Preview Manifest</strong>,
  <input name="checkbox7" id="checkbox11" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
  <a href="Ops_BuildReportPreveiw.shtml"><strong>Build Reports</strong></a> and
  <input name="checkbox8" id="checkbox12" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
  <strong>Build Messages</strong> selected,
  press
  <input name="button25" id="button26" value="Preview" type="submit">
and all the Reports and Train Manifest are previewed, then you may
print the desired reports or manifest using your system print dialog.</p>
<p><strong>Problems Building Trains</strong></p>
<p>If you have a problem building a train you can select the
  <input name="checkbox9" id="checkbox13" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
  <strong>Build  Reports </strong>checkbox at the bottom of the train panel. When a build fails  for any reason and the
  <input name="checkbox10" id="checkbox14" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
  <strong>Build  Reports</strong> checkbox is selected, the program  will send a report to your printer if the
  <input name="checkbox11" id="checkbox15" type="checkbox">
  <strong>Preview Manifests</strong> isn't  selected; or to a preview window if the
  <input name="checkbox12" id="checkbox16" checked="checked" type="checkbox">
  <strong>Preview Manifests</strong>
is selected. The build report can print out different levels of detail,
from minimal to very detailed. See the Settings section <a href="Ops_PrintOptions.shtml">Build  Report Details</a> for more information on how to change the build report  detail level.</p>
<p>The program now confirms during the build that all of the cars in a kernal have the same departure location and track.</p>
<p>The program will wait for the scripts to complete prior to building a train.</p>
<h4>Building Multiple Trains for a Session</h4>
<p>Most operating sessions require more than one train to keep your
operators busy. The correct way to do this is to build and print all of
the trains needed before terminating them. So if you need a dozen
trains for a session, you must build twelve trains before you terminate
any one train. Terminating a train tells the program that the engines
and cars in that particular train have been delivered to their final
locations and can be used again when building new trains. So always
build all, print all, THEN terminate each train after completing its
run! It is okay to build all trains, print all train, and then use the <input name="button37" id="button45" value="Save Builds" type="submit">
  and shut down the program. Later you can restart the  program and terminate the trains that completed their runs. </p>
<p>The correct time to terminate a train is when the train actually
arrives at its destination. Terminating a train before it completes it
run means that the operation database believes that the engines and
cars have been delivered. It is better to build and print twelve trains
and then later find out that only nine trains completed their runs. You
would then terminate nine trains, and leave the other three for next
time. Or if you wish you could reset any trains that didn't depart from
their terminal. Reseting trains really isn't necessary, the trains that
didn't run during this session could run the during the next session. </p>
<p>An alternate method is to build, print, and use the
  <input name="button39" id="button46" value="Move" type="submit">
for each train to track the actual movement of the trains during your
session. As long as the trains on your layout match the locations in
the program you can build a new train. </p>
<h4>Moving Trains</h4>
<p>After providing your operators with a printed manifest or location
switch list, you must keep the program database synchronized with the
actual movement of trains on your layout. This is done by the <input name="button38" id="button47" value="Move" type="submit">
  located on the far right of the train menu. Pressing the
  <input name="button40" id="button48" value="Move" type="submit">
will cause the train to depart its current location move to the next
location in the route. The engines and cars assigned to the train will
travel to the next location on the railroad. At each location, cars can
be picked up or dropped off. You can also move a train by selecting the
train's icon and selecting <input name="button41" id="button49" value="Move" type="submit">
  from the icon's popup menu. Each  press of the
  <input name="button42" id="button50" value="Move" type="submit">
moves the train closer to its terminal location. When the train arrives
at the last location in the route, the last press of the <input name="button43" id="button51" value="Move" type="submit">
  will terminate the train. Once a train  is terminated, you can build it again. </p>
<p>Each time an engine or car is moved a count associated with them is
incremented. The program uses this to determine which cars haven't
moved recently and tries to select cars with the least number of moves
when building new trains. Each time a location has a car picked up or
dropped, the program increments a count associated with that location.
The program tries to move cars to locations that have experienced the
least number of car operations.</p>
