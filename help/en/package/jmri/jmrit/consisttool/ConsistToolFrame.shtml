<h1>Consist Tool</h1>

	<h2>Using the Consist Tool</h2>
	<p>
	When you first open the consist tool, you will see a screen similar to the following:
        </p>
	<img src=images/ConsistTool.png alt="Blank Consist Tool">
        <p>
	   The buttons on the top row are used to select between an Advanced (or 
           Decoder Assisted) Consist and a Command Station Assisted 
           Consist.  If the Command Station Assisted Consists are not 
           supported by the tool for your system, these selections will be 
           grayed out.
        </p>
	<p>
           The box Next to the label <b>Consist:</b> is used to specify the 
           consist ID.  For Decoder Assisted Consists, this should be the 
           short address used to identify the consist.  For Command 
           Station Assisted Consists, this value may automatically be 
           filled in with the lead locomotive address when you try to add 
           it to the consist.
        </p>
        <p>
           Adding a typical ID for a Decoder Assisted Consist should look 
           like the following:
        </p>
	   <img src=images/ConsistTool-IDAdded.png alt="Consist Tool - ID Added">
        <p>
	   The second line of the consisting tool is used to add locomotives.
           A locomotive may be added either by entering it's number in the 
           box next to <b>New Locomotive</b> or by selecting it's number 
           from the roster drop down box.
        </p>
           <img src=images/ConsistTool-LeadLoco.png alt="Lead Locomotive Selected">
        <p>
          Clicking the <b>add</b> button will add a locomotive to the 
          consist, and it will appear in the list below the second line.
        </p>
          <img src=images/ConsistTool-LeadLocoAdded.png alt="Lead Locomotive Added to Consist">
        <p>
          Clicking the <b>reset</b> button will clear the information for 
          this locomotive.
        </p>
	<p>
           The <b>Direction Normal</b> checkbox is used to determine if 
           the locomotive is traveling in forward or reverse when the 
           consist is traveling forward.
        </p>
        <p>
           You may notice from the previous screen shots that this box is 
           grayed out until a lead locomotive is selected.  With 
           subsequent locomotives, you can check this box to indicate the
           direction of the locomotive relative to the lead locomotive.
        </p>
           <img src=images/ConsistTool-SecondLoco.png alt="Second LocoMotive Selected - Direction Reversed">
        <p>
           After adding the second locomotive to the consist, with the
           direction reversed, you should see something like the following:
        </p>
           <img src=images/ConsistTool-SecondLocoAdded.png alt="Second Locomotive Added">
        <p>
           If you made a mistake, and add a second locomotive to the 
           consist with the wrong direction, you can change it's direction 
           simply by clicking on the checkbox in the Direction Normal column.
	</p>
           <img src=images/ConsistTool-SecondLocoDirChange.png alt="Second Locomotive - Direction Change">
        <p>
           The direction of the lead locomotive cannot be changed once 
           added.
        </p>
        <p>
           To delete an individual locomotive from the consist, you can
           select the <b>Delete</b> button in the right most column of the 
           appropriate row of the table of addresses.
        </p>
        <p>
           To <b>delete an entire consist</b> you can use the <b>Delete</b> 
           button at the bottom of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
           To <b>Reverse the consist</b> you can use the <b>Reverse</b> 
           button at the bottom of the screen.  This operation will cause
           order of the locomotives in the consist to reverse and the 
           direction of each consist to change from normal to reverse and 
           vice vera.
        </p>
        <p>
           The <b>throttle button</b> at the bottom of the screen can be used to
           bring up a JMRI throttle for this address.
        </p>
        <p>
           The <b>Restore</b> button at the bottom of the screen is used to
           force the consit tool to re-write the consist to the command station.           This option is useful if either the consist has been erased from 
           the command station and/or decoder memory.
e       </p>
        <p>
           To Add a new consist, you can select the blank entry in the 
           drop-down box next to the current consist's ID.
        </p>
	   <img src=images/ConsistTool-NewConsist.png alt="Select New Consist">
        <p>
           To Recall an existing consist, you can select the appropriate 
           entry from the drop-down box next to the current consist's ID.
        </p>
	   <img src=images/ConsistTool-SelectConsist.png alt="Select a Consist">
        <p>
           Begining with JMRI version 4.17.3, an option exists in the File
           menu to <b>Scan Roster for Consists</b>.  This option reads the
           files of the roster and examines CV19 (The Consist Address).  If
           a consist address is found, the locomotive is added to that consist.
           This operation does not write consist information to the command 
           station. 
        </p>
