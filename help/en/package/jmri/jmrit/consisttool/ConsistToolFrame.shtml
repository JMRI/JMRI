      <h1>Consist Tool</h1>

      <h2>Using the Consist Tool</h2>

      <p>When you first open the consist tool, you will see a screen similar to the following:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool.png" alt="Blank Consist Tool">
      <p>The buttons on the top row are used to select between an Advanced (or Decoder Assisted)
      Consist and a Command Station Assisted Consist. If the Command Station Assisted Consists are
      not supported by the tool for your system, these selections will be grayed out.</p>

      <p>The box Next to the label <strong>Consist:</strong> is used to specify the consist ID. For
      Decoder Assisted Consists, this should be the short address used to identify the consist. For
      Command Station Assisted Consists, this value may automatically be filled in with the lead
      locomotive address when you try to add it to the consist.</p>

      <p>Adding a typical ID for a Decoder Assisted Consist should look like the following:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-IDAdded.png" alt="Consist Tool - ID Added">
      <p>The second line of the consisting tool is used to add locomotives. A locomotive may be
      added either by entering it's number in the box next to <strong>New Locomotive</strong> or by
      selecting it's number from the roster drop down box.</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-LeadLoco.png" alt="Lead Locomotive Selected">
      <p>Clicking the <strong>add</strong> button will add a locomotive to the consist, and it will
      appear in the list below the second line.</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-LeadLocoAdded.png" alt="Lead Locomotive Added to Consist">
      <p>Clicking the <strong>reset</strong> button will clear the information for this
      locomotive.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Direction Normal</strong> checkbox is used to determine if the locomotive is
      traveling in forward or reverse when the consist is traveling forward.</p>

      <p>You may notice from the previous screen shots that this box is grayed out until a lead
      locomotive is selected. With subsequent locomotives, you can check this box to indicate the
      direction of the locomotive relative to the lead locomotive.</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-SecondLoco.png" alt=
      "Second LocoMotive Selected - Direction Reversed">
      <p>After adding the second locomotive to the consist, with the direction reversed, you should
      see something like the following:</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-SecondLocoAdded.png" alt="Second Locomotive Added">
      <p>If you made a mistake, and add a second locomotive to the consist with the wrong
      direction, you can change it's direction simply by clicking on the checkbox in the Direction
      Normal column.</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-SecondLocoDirChange.png" alt=
      "Second Locomotive - Direction Change">
      <p>The direction of the lead locomotive cannot be changed once added.</p>

      <p>To delete an individual locomotive from the consist, you can select the
      <strong>Delete</strong> button in the right most column of the appropriate row of the table
      of addresses.</p>

      <p>To <strong>delete an entire consist</strong> you can use the <strong>Delete</strong>
      button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

      <p>To <strong>Reverse the consist</strong> you can use the <strong>Reverse</strong> button at
      the bottom of the screen. This operation will cause order of the locomotives in the consist
      to reverse and the direction of each consist to change from normal to reverse and vice
      vera.</p>

      <p>The <strong>throttle button</strong> at the bottom of the screen can be used to bring up a
      JMRI throttle for this address.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Restore</strong> button at the bottom of the screen is used to force the
      consit tool to re-write the consist to the command station. This option is useful if either
      the consist has been erased from the command station and/or decoder memory. e</p>

      <p>To Add a new consist, you can select the blank entry in the drop-down box next to the
      current consist's ID.</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-NewConsist.png" alt="Select New Consist">
      <p>To Recall an existing consist, you can select the appropriate entry from the drop-down box
      next to the current consist's ID.</p>
      <img src="images/ConsistTool-SelectConsist.png" alt="Select a Consist">
      <p>Begining with JMRI version 4.17.3, an option exists in the File menu to <strong>Scan
      Roster for Consists</strong>. This option reads the files of the roster and examines CV19
      (The Consist Address). If a consist address is found, the locomotive is added to that
      consist. This operation does not write consist information to the command station.</p>
