     <h1>JMRI : Cab Signals</h1>
       
       <p>JMRI generated Cab Signals are currently available for the following hadware types : </p>

        <ul>
        <li>LocoNet</li>
        <li>MERG CBUS</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Signal Data Table Columns</h2>

            >
    
        <ul>
        <li>Loco ID</li>
        <li>Send Cabdata checkbox - Will send data for Cab Signalling when 
            the next signal aspect or speed changes.
            Will not send when the master Cabdata button is paused.</li>
        <li>Block - Current Block Username</li>
        <li>Direction of current block</li>
        <li>Block Button - "Block Lookup" Will search for a block which 
            matches the loco ID or alternative TD value.
            <br>If an existing block is set, the "Change Direction" button 
            can manually reverse the current block direction.</li>
        <li>Next Block Username</li>
        <li>Next Signal Mast Username</li>
        <li>Next Aspect</li>
        <li>Next Aspect ( Icon )<br>The icon orientations can be changed 
            via the Aspect Icon Menu in the top menu bar.</li>
        </ul>
                
        <p>The table will attempt to identify which 
        block the train is in via the 
        block value ( train describer ).</p>
        
        <p>The table will update when the 
        train number is the block value.</p>
        
        <p>A block initially has no direction set, 
        forward values can only be calculated 
        when JMRI knows what direction the block is set.</p>
        
        <p>The direction is normally calculated by 
        JMRI when a new block is occupied, 
        then comparing neighbouring blocks.</p>
        
        <p>This process can be triggered manually by clicking 
        the Block Lookup button.</p>
        
        <p>The button will change to a Reverse Direction button 
        if a block is located for the train ID.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>Layout Editor blocks can be checked for continuity 
        in Layout Editor by 
        taking the panel into edit mode, 
        then clicking on Tools > Check.</p>
        
        <p>You can view block routing by right clicking 
        on an individual Layout Editor 
        track segment and selecting View Block Routing.</p>
        
        <p>The table will follow the block route of the train until 
        it finds the next signal or bumper / buffer stop.</p>  

        <p>Signals used by this tool are defined using <a href="../../../../html/tools/signaling/AspectSignaling.shtml">Aspect Signalling</a>.

    <h2>Digitrax Throttle Cab Signals</h2>

        <p>The LocoNet Cab signal indications is intended to work with Digitrax         throttles with digitrax throttles that include semaphore icons for the 
        Left and Right throttles.  The code was developed and tested using a 
        DT402 and a DT500.  The basic message format shold work with a DT300 
        and DT400 as well, though they have not been tested by the author.</p>

        <p>As of JMRI 4.15.4, it is only possible to send cab signal 
        indications to throttles when they are plugged in to the 
        LocoNet.  This is limitation of the hardware and is true even on 
        Duplex Wireless systems.</p>

        <p>When a cab signal is active, The throttle will beep every time a
        new aspect is sent to the throttle.  The beep may occur even when no
        change of aspect is seen.</p>

        <p>The Digitrax Cab Signal Semaphores have 3 controlable blades 
        (horizontal, diagonal, and verticle).  When the semaphore is active,
        Each blade can be turned on and off.  The semaphore can also be set 
        to flash.</p>

        <p>The JMRI support for Digitrax Cab Signal Semaphores uses the 
        speed indication from the Aspects as indicated in the following table.</p>
