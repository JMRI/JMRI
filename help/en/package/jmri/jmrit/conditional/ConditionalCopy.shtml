      <h1>Conditional Copy List</h1>

      <dl>
        <dd>
          <h2><a name="logix" id="logix">Logix Copy</a></h2>

          <p>The conditionals of one logix can be copied into another 
          logix by selecting the "Copy" item from the <strong>Select</strong>
          menu. The <Strong>Copy Logix</strong> window will be displayed.
          This window is similar to the <Strong>Add Logix</strong> window and
          the same rules must be be followed when creating a new logix.
          Additionally, you may enter the name of an existing logix and copy 
          conditionals into it. You may even copy logix conditionals back into the same
          logix.  Of course the same restrictions about duplicate system and
          user names of conditionals must be followed. For detailed information
          about editing conditionals see the
          <a href="../../../../html/tools/Logix.shtml">Logix main page</a>.</p>
          <p></P>

          <h2><a name="CopyList" id="CopyList">The Copy List</a></h2>

          <p>After choosing a target logix and pressing the copy button, the 
          <strong>Copy List</strong> window is displays the list of conditionals
          of the source logix.  Select a conditional from the list to copy.
          There are two ways to add the conditional to the target logix.
          Either is done by the radio buttons under the conditional list.</p>
           <p></P>
           
          <h3>The Change Items Only Button</h3>

          <p>This choice (the default) displays a copy of the selected conditional
          for quick copying where you only want to change the items tested or
          items to react. The tests and actions of the item are shown but cannot
          be changed. The logical expression cannot be changed either.</p>
          
          <p>The items under the <strong>Name</strong> columns of the Variables and
          Actions tables are combo boxes (see "Logix Option Choices" below). 
          These drop down to select the change of item for
          the variable or action. Actions may be deleted, but not variables.</p>
          
          <p>This choice is intended to for simply changing item names. Provide 
          a name for the new conditional and press the
          <strong>Save</strong> button.  The conditional is saved to the target
          logix and you are returned to the Copy List window.</p>
          <p></P>

          <h3>The Edit all Data Button</h3>

          <p>This choice displays a copy of the selected conditional with
          full conditional editing capabilities. There are no restrictions
          on how the copy is changed.</p>
          
          <p>Provide a name for the new conditional and press the
          <strong>Save</strong> button.  The conditional is saved to the target
          logix and you are returned to the Copy List window.</p>
          <p></P>

          <h2>Logix Option Choices</h2>

          <p>The choices made under the Logix <strong>Options</strong> menu are 
          followed by edit conditional window displayed by the
          <strong>Edit all Data</strong> button.</p>

          <p>The quick edit window displayed by the <strong>Change Items Only</strong> 
          button uses drop drop down combo boxes for the "Traditional Pick List"
          option. If you prefer using a picklist other than combo boxes, use
          the "Single Pick List" option. To enter an indirect reference to a
          memory, the "Single Pick List" option must be used.</p>
