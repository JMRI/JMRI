      <h1>Conditional Tree Editor</h1>

      <p>The tree based Conditional Editor uses a single window to display and edit all
      of the conditionals for the selected Logix.</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
      <a href="images/TreeEditor.png">
      <img src="images/TreeEditor.png"
      alt="Conditional Tree Editor" height="383" width="886">
      </a>
      </div>

      <p>The window is divided into 4 sections.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The top section contains the Logix system and user names.  The user
      name can be changed. Enter the name and press Enter.</li>
      <li>The left pane of the center section contains the tree structure for
      all of the conditionals for the currently selected Logix.  The tree can
      expand and collapse to control the amount of detail being displayed.</li>
      <li>The right pane of the center section contains the detail information,
      if any, about the currently selected tree row.</li>
      <li>The right side of bottom section contains the <strong>Done</strong>
      button which closes the editor window.  The left side contains the
      <strong>Action</strong> buttons.  These buttons vary depending on the
      selected tree row.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong><em>The workflow for the tree editor is dynamic.  As each
      change is made, it is applied to the Conditional tables.  As long as the
      panel xml file has not been updated, it is still possible to recover.
      </em></strong></p>

      <p>The tree structure makes it very easy to move around.  The only
      restriction is that a different tree node cannot be selected if there is
      an active edit.  To make an active edit apparent, the detail <strong>
      Cancel</strong> and <strong>Update</strong> buttons become active and the
      action bar buttons become inactive.  Clicking on any field in the detail
      pane changes the pane from Display mode to Edit mode</p>

      <p>The first level of the tree contains the Conditionals that belong to
      the current Logix. The second level contains the Antecedent field, the
      Logic Type and Trigger Mode fields along with a Variables and Actions
      node.  The third level contains the detail rows for Variables and
      Actions.</p>

      <p>1 &mdash; Move is actually an <strong>Up</strong> button and a
      <strong>Down</strong> button.<br>
      2 &mdash; Move is disabled for Variables if the Logic Type is set to
      <strong>Mixed</strong>.</p>

      <h2>The Edit Process</h2>
      <p>When the tree editor is started, the conditionals for the selected
      Logix are displayed.  Each row contains the system name, the user name,
      and the current state in brackets.  Select a row to change the user name
      using the detail pane.  When the change is done, press <strong>Update
      </strong>. The user name may not be the same as the user name of another
      Conditional in this Logix, but may be the same as the user name of a
      Conditional in a different Logix.</p>

      <p>To change the order of the Conditionals, select a Conditional row
      and use the <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons to
      move the row. Note that the order that Conditionals are listed in the
      Logix does not determine the order in which they're evaluated, nor does
      it force evaluation of one Conditional when an earlier or later
      one is evaluated. For more on this, see the discussion on the
      <a href="../../../../html/tools/Logix.shtml">Logix main
      page</a>.</p>

      <p>Conditionals are statements of the form:</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p><code>if (logical expression) then
      (action)</code></p></div>

      <p>When a Conditional row is expanded, five rows are displayed.  The
      Antecedent, Variables and Logix Type rows are used to build the Logical
      Expression.  The Trigger Mode and Actions rows are used to build the
      Action.</p>

      <h2>Logical Expression</h2>

      <p>Expand the <strong>Variables</strong> row to see the individual
      <strong>Variable</strong> rows. Each row starts with a row number (Rn)
      which is used to create manual logic when the Logic Type has been set
      to <strong>Mixed</strong>.  A description of the statement follows.  The
      trigger setting and the last calculated state are in bold at the end.</p>

      <p>When a Variable row is selected, the information will be displayed in
      the detail section.  The first 4 detail rows are common to all Variable
      types. The first row is the selected type.  The second one will be set
      to AND or OR.  This is set automatically by the Logic Type or manually
      when using MIXED.  The third row can be set to NOT.  If set, that will
      invert the test.  The fourth row is the Trigger Calculation checkbox.
      For those cases where a change in a specific entity (sensor, turnout,
      etc.) should not trigger a calculation result, you should uncheck the
      checkbox by clicking on it. Unchecking the checkbox tells the program to
      monitor that entity for state changes and calculate the state of the
      Conditional, but take no action on the result of the calculation.</p>

      <p>The remaining fields in the detail section will vary depending on
      selected Variable Type. If you don't know what needs to be entered in a
      data field, hover your cursor over the label, and a hint message will
      appear. For details, see
      <a href="StateVariableActionList.shtml#variable">State Variables</a>.</p>

      <p>The Logic Type can be set to <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>
      or <strong>MIXED</strong>.  If AND or OR, the descriptive portion of the
      Variable will display all AND or all OR.  If set to MIXED, each line can
      have its own value.  See below.</p>

      <p>The default <strong>Logic Type</strong> is "AND". In this case the
      Conditional will test if all variable tests are true, after taking the
      "NOT" negations into account. Using the <strong>Logic Type</strong> row,
      you can change that to "OR" or "Mixed". "OR" means the conditional will
      be true if any one of the variable tests are true, after accounting for
      the negations.</p>

      <p>Selecting "Mixed" will enable the Antecedent row.  Select this row to
      display the antecedent field in the detail pane. This will let you enter
      a logical expression using AND's, 'OR's and NOT's and the row numbers. In
      this expression, each variable is referred to by number, e.g. R1, R2, R3
      for the first three variables, you can use the operators "and", "or" and
      "not" in addition to parentheses. Some examples:</p>
      
      <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p><code>
      R1 and R2<br>
      R1 or (R2 and R3)<br>
      (R2 and R3) or (R3 and R1)
      </code></p></div>

      <h3>Adding a New State Variable</h3>

      <p>Press the <strong>Add</strong> button when either the Variables row or
      a Variable row is selected to add a state variable. The detail pane will
      display a choice box for the user to select a state variable type.
      Available state variables are documented at
      <a href="StateVariableActionList.shtml#variable">State Variables</a>.
      When a type is chosen, additional fields will be added to the detail pane.

      The text field for the name must contain an existing entity (sensor,
      turnout, light, etc.). The actual format for entering names will depend
      on the conditional name selection method setting. See
      <a href="../beantable/LogixTable.shtml#logixOptions">
      Conditional Name Selection Method</a>.</p>
      
      <p>For Conditional Variables, the text input field is replaced by two
      drop down combo boxes.  The first box is used to select the Logix, the
      second box is used to select a Conditional that belongs to the selected
      Logix.
      <span class="since">since 4.7.4</span></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
      <a href="images/SelectConditionalReference.png">
      <img src="images/SelectConditionalReference.png"
      alt="Logix/Conditional Combo Boxes" height="148" width="558">
      </a>
      </div>

      <p>After the name is entered, select the required state from the
      <strong>Variable State</strong> drop down box.  Depending on the selected
      variable type and state, additional fields may be displayed.

      <p>After you have completed your updates, you can select the Variables
      row and use the <strong>Check State</strong> button to evaluate the state
      variables. When this button is pressed, the checking and evaluation
      proceeds until the check completes successfully, or an error is detected.
      If an error is detected, the checking stops for the user to correct the
      error and click <strong>Check State</strong> again.</p>

      <p>Select <strong>Update</strong> to save the changes or
      <strong>Cancel</strong> to discard the changes.</p>

      <h2>Action</h2>

      <p>Expand the <strong>Actions</strong> row to see the individual
      <strong>Action</strong> rows. Each row starts with a phrase that indicates
      under what conditions it will be invoked.  A description of the Action
      follows.</p>

      <p>Actions are evaluated in the order listed. To change that
      order, select an Action row and use the <strong>Up</strong> and
      <strong>Down</strong> buttons to move the row.</p>

      Select an Action row to display the details in the detail pane.  Click on
      a field to enter edit mode.  To create a new Action, select
      <strong>Add</strong> from either the Actions or Action button list.

      <p>If a new Action is being created, only the Action Group will be
      displayed. Once a choice has been made, other fields will be displayed
      based on the selected type. Available Action types are documented at
      <a href="StateVariableActionList.shtml#action">Actions</a>.</p>

      <p>When a type is chosen, the Edit Action window displays a text field for
      the name of the entity to be used for the Action. When a name
      (either system name or user name) is entered, it must
      correspond to an existing entity (sensor, turnout, light,
      etc.). The actual method for entering names
      will depend on the conditional name selection method setting.
      See <a href="../beantable/LogixTable.shtml#logixOptions">
      Conditional Name Selection Method</a>.</p>
      
      <p>The data items needed to completely specify the
      action will appear in the detail pane. If you don't
      know what needs to be entered in a data field, hover your
      cursor over the label, and a hint message will appear.</p>

      <p>For each action, three options are available for when to
      trigger the action:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On Change to True</li>
        <li>On Change to False</li>
        <li>On Change</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These refer to the calculated state
      of the Conditional, which is equal to the value of the
      logical expression as specified in the state variable table.
      One of these options must be selected.</p>

      <p>If the <strong>Trigger Mode:</strong> row has been changed to
      <strong>Execute Action whenever triggered</strong>, then the options are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When Triggered True</li>
        <li>When Triggered False</li>
        <li>Whenever Triggered</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Select <strong>Update</strong> to save the changes or
      <strong>Cancel</strong> to discard the changes.</p>
