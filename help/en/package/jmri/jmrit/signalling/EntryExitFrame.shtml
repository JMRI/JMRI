<h1>JMRI: Entry/Exit (NX)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
	The Entry/Exit system uses Sensors assigned to Block boundaries in the JMRI Layout Editor 
to set a route up between two locations in the Layout Editor when these Sensors are activated in 
the correct order. These two sensors are refered to as the NX Pair.
<p>
<b>Block Boundaries</b>
Sensors, like Signals (either Heads or Masts), should be added at block boundaries. 
 To do this, right click on the "Anchor Point" between two track segments. 
 If this location is a boundary point (i.e. with a different block on each side), then you 
 will get the option in the menu to set Signals, Sensors or Signal Masts. 
 What this does is associate that item with that particular location on the layout.  
 <br> The window that pops up allows you to assign the item to work in a particular direction 
 (or protecting a certain block). 
<p>
There are three different types of Entry/Exit that can be configured.
<ul>
    <li>Turnout Only</li>
    <li>Turnout and SignalMast Logic</li>
    <li>Full Interlocking</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Turnout Only</b> With turnout only, the NX Pair will only set the turnouts to the correct state for
that route.  If a block is already showing as occupied or reserved within that route, and an alternative 
one is available then the alternative route will be set, otherwise the route will not be set.
<p>
<b>Turnout and SignalMast Logic</b> This option includes what is covered by "Turnout Only" 
and will also generate the SignalMast Logic for that route.  The logic will include the turnout states 
and the blocks that are within that route.  For this to work, SignalMasts must also be placed at the 
same boundary points as the sensors working in the same direction.  The SignalMast logic will remain 
for the duration of the operating session, however it is not saved and will be re-created the next time 
the panel is open.
<br>
When there is no route set then the SignalMast will be placed in a held state.
<br>
<p>
<b>Full Interlocking</b> This covers the same things as the other two items above.  In addition, it will also 
"reserve" or "lock out" each block in the route so that no other conflicting route can be set.  If block occupancy 
detection is being used the route will automatically be cleared down.  If no block occupancy is being used, then
it is possible to manually clear the route down by selecting the corresponding NX pair, it will leave the last block 
as showing occupied, as if the train had travelled the route and was now sitting waiting at the next signal.<br>
If there are no Signalmasts configured between the NX pair, then the route will still be set and reserved, but no 
SignalMast Logic will be generated.<br>
The route will stay active, until either a train has passed through the blocks and they have returned to an unoccupied 
state, the route has been manually cleared down, or has been cancelled.
<p>
<h2>Entry/Exit (NX) Window</h2>
From this window you can create and delete Entry Exit Pairs for a given layout panel
<p>
You first need to assign sensors at Block boundaries on the layout editor, by using the pop up window
on block boundaries, turnouts or Level Crossings.  These sensors act the NX selection buttons.
<p>
From the Entry Exit window, select the layout panel that you are working on, you can then either 
manually select the source and destination sensor pair, or all the system to automatically discover 
all the valid paths, by pressing the "Auto Generate Entry Exit Pairs" button.
<p>
The result will be populated in the table below the button.
<p>
The auto discovery will only discover fully valid pairs for sensors that are effectively protecting
 blocks that are in the same direction.  This also means that to set the route through you must first 
 set the "From" sensor then set the "To" sensor, if you want to be able to set the route by selecting 
 either sensor first, then you will need to check the "Both Way" option.  If the end point is assigned 
 to an end Bumper then this will not be possible.
<p>
It is possible to manually add Entry Exit pairs for sensors that are in effect protecting blocks that 
work in opposite directions.  Here you will need to use the drop down options to select the start and 
finish locations against a layout panel.  Again you can select this pair to be "Both Way" working.
<p>
For turnouts you need to right click on the circle at the centre, again this will bring up 
the same options to set, if there are block boundaries present.  
On a turnout you can only assign items that will protect the block the turnout is in, 
you can not protect/assign an item on the way out of a turnout so to speak. The same with level-crossings.

<h3>Options</h3>
<b>Route reselection</b> Determines what should occur when the NX route is reselected by the user, the options are<ul>
<li>Prompt User - Ask the user what they would like to do</li>
<li>Clear Route - Automatically clear the route down</li>
<li>Cancel Route - Cancel the route</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Initial colour of path while route it Setup</b> While the route is being setup, set the track colour to that in the drop down, 
after a predetermined time the track will revert back to that defined in the block configuration.
<p>
<b>Duration of setting Colour(ms)</b> How long the initial colour will be displayed for after the route has initial been selected.
<p>
<b>Integrate With Dispatcher</b> Select this option if you want to use the NX route to extend the path of an Active Train in the dispatcher, this option will only work if the block prior to the NX route is allocated to an active train and that block is also the end block.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once the NX pairs have been created, you can set a route by simply selecting the Entry Sensor, followed by the Exit Sensor, if a valid path can be found then the route will be set up according to how it has been configured.  If a full interlock has been configured the NX Sensors will remain active.
<p>Whenever you select a NX Sensor, it will flash until a valid Exit sensor has been selected.  If no valid Exit sensor has been selected it will automatically be cancelled after 30 seconds.

<p><b>Extended Route Setting</b>
<p>Normally with the NX interlock, you would set a route up selecting the Entry/Exit sensors along a path, so for example to get from location A to D, you would first set up A-B, then B-C and finally C-D.  However the system will allow you to set up a route directly from A to D, simply by selecting the A&amp;D NX sensor, it will then go through and find the best valid path and setup each individual interlock along the path. 
<br><b>Note - </b> If you are cancelling or clearing an Extended when set as a Full Interlock (see below), then you will be prompted to cancel or clear each individual interlock.  In addition it is not currently possible to Stack an extended route.

<h3>Full Interlock</h3>
<p>When using the Full Interlock method, it will highlight the route and prevent a conflicting route from being set.  In addition the Entry and Exit Sensors will remain active, to show where the path has been set from and to.  Once a train has entered the route, the Entry sensor will return back to inactive, while the Exit sensor will only go inactive if no onward route has been selected.
<p><b>Cancel Route</b>
<p>To cancel a route that has been setup, simply reselect the Entry and Exit Sensors.  You will then be given four options, simply select "Cancel".

<p><b>Route Stacking</b>
<p>If a route cannot be set due to a Block already being allocated or occupied, you will be presented with the option to "stack" the route.  When the route is stacked a new window will pop up on the screen which shows the routes that have been stacked.  Once a route has been stacked, the system will check every 10 seconds to see if it is possible to set-up that NX route, multiple NX routes can be stacked, and they are checked in the order which they were stacked in, a NX route cannot be stacked more than once.  To cancel a NX route, selected it in the table and click on the cancel button at the bottom.

<p><b>Manual Route Clear Down</b>
<p>If the layout is not fully block detected, then with the NX has the ability to clear down the route. What occurs here is that the blocks are made Occupied, then Unoccupied in the correct order, leaving the last block Occupied, thus simulating a train passing through the interlock.  To do this, reselect the route and select "Clear Down".
