      <h1>Adding/Editing Signal Mast Logic</h1>

      <p>After clicking on the "Add..." button below the <a href=
      "../beantable/SignalMastLogicTable.shtml">Signal Mast Logic
      Table</a>, the following window appears:</p><a href=
      "../beantable/images/SignalMastLogicAdd.png"><img src=
      "../beantable/images/SignalMastLogicAdd.png" align="right"
      width="340" height="300" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt=
      "Signal Head Logic Add window"></a>

      <p>The first thing you must do when creating a Signal Mast
      Logic is to select the Source Signal Mast followed by the
      Destination Signal Mast. The source signal mast is the one
      which you wish to control and set the appearances on. The
      destination signal mast is the next signal mast down the
      line. The Appearance of the destination Signal Mast along
      with the state of the Turnouts and Blocks that you check on
      this screen will have a direct effect on the Appearance of
      the source signal mast.<br>
      If you are not using the Layout Editor, then <em>no</em>
      validation is performed of the source and destination Signal
      Masts. If the Layout Editor is being used, then the system
      will try and determine if the destination Signal Mast is
      reachable from the source mast.</p>

      <p>The check box "Use Layout Editor Paths" allows you to get
      JMRI to automatically generate the required Blocks, Turnouts
      and Signal Masts, along with their states, that are located
      between the source and destination Signal Masts.<br>
      On selecting "Use Layout Editor Paths", two further check
      boxes will appear: "Use Turnout Details From Layout Editor"
      and "Use Block Details From Layout Editor". Selecting either
      of these will determine what information from the Layout
      Editor is used when the system automatically generates the
      route.<br>
      The automatically generated information is not saved with the
      panel file, but it is generated each time the layout panel is
      opened.<br>
      If the information on the layout editor panel is edited, the
      change is not reflected in the Signal Mast Logic; you will
      need to store the panel, close JMRI and re-open the panel for
      the Signal Mast Logic to be updated.</p>

      <p>The "Allow The Logic to Automatically Determine
      Conflicting SignalMasts" option tries to determine which
      Signal Masts could possibly cause a conflicting route if they
      were not set to danger.</p>

      <p>The "Lock Turnouts when Signal Mast Logic is active"
      feature allows you to selectively disable accessory (turnout)
      commands from cabs and/or locally-wired pushbuttons. When
      selected, JMRI disables pushbuttons by sending pushbutton
      disable commands to the Turnout decoders when the route is
      locked, and enables the pushbuttons when the route is
      unlocked. When locking a Turnout from cab commands, the JMRI
      program will monitor the Turnout's accessory address and if
      it detects a change command from a cab, will cancel the
      command immediately by sending out the opposite command to
      the Turnout. All Turnouts that are being monitored by the
      JMRI program and are included in the route will be
      locked.</p>

      <p>The "Show"" radio buttons allow you to show all or only
      the selected Turnouts, Sensors, Blocks or Signal Masts that
      are part of this Signal Mast Logic.</p>

      <p>There are four tabs below the "Show" buttons, each
      containing the details of Blocks, Turnouts, Sensors and
      Signalmasts that make up the Signal Mast Logic for this
      Source Mast. In each of these tabs, there is an editable
      table that allows you to manually select which item(s) should
      be included in the Signal Mast Logic and the state which each
      item should be in.<br>
      Below that is a second table that shows the automatically
      generated items (except in the sensor tab). Manually entered
      items over-ride the automatically generated items, therefore
      if you wish to over-ride any item in automatically generated
      list then in the manual table select the corresponding item
      and set the state. Click the "Include" box in any of the
      tables to add the desired item to your Signal Mast Logic.
      Next to the "Include" box is the State option which that item
      must be in for the Source Signal Mast to come active. For
      example, if you wish a Turnout to be in a Thrown state to
      trigger the Signal Mast Logic, then select "Thrown" in the
      drop down box. If you wish to over-ride a turnout that was
      automatically included, and you don't care what state it is
      set to, select "Any State" from the drop down box.</p>

      <p>Clicking on the "Update Signal Mast Logic" button will add
      or update this Signal Mast Logic to the system. Apply will
      do that too, and close the Edit pane. Once a new Logic is added,
      the tables holding the automatically generated data will be
      re-populated.</p>
