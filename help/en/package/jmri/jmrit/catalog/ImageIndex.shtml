      <h1>The Image Index Editor</h1>This window is used to create
      an Image Index. The index may be organized according to any
      taxonomy you wish. Using it allows you to access any image
      file that is accessible from your computer without moving or
      copying the file. It is similar to a table of contents or
      index that you might find in a reference textbook.

      <h2>Contents of the Image Index Editor</h2><img src=
      "ImageIndex.png" align="right">

      <p>The window contains two panes side by side. The left side
      is your current Image Catalog. This is what the Icon Editors
      have been using to change icons. The top panel of this pane
      consists of one or more trees. The default tree is "Program
      Directory", the catalog of all the image files downloaded
      with the version of JMRI you are using. These are files that
      were encapsulated in "jmri.jar". Another default tree may be
      "Preferences Directory", the catalog of all the image files
      contained in the "resources" directory in your JMRI
      preferences directory. If you have not created a "resources"
      directory in your JMRI preferences directory you will not see
      this tree. Other trees that you may see are those that you
      have installed after using the <b>Open File System
      Directory</b> menu item in one of the Icon Editor windows and
      pressed the <b>Add to Catalog</b> button there. (The "Add to
      Catalog" button does not appear in this window.) Next to each
      tree is a "Preview" pane that displays the images found in
      any node that you have selected from one of the above trees.
      "Nodes" are the folder icons that appear when you click on
      the handle to the left of a folder icon. Clicking on a node
      will open a pane that displays the icons contained in the
      node.</p>

      <p>The "Preview" pane has a label that states how many image
      files are referenced in the node. Beneath each image (icon)
      is a label that states the "scale" at which the image is
      displayed. Below the icons are "View on:" combo boxes
      that allow you to choose a  background for the icons.
      This may help you determine what parts of the icon are
      opaque and what parts are transparent.</p>

      <p>The right side is the <b>Image Index</b> you may edit. It
      is similar to the left pane in that the left half shows the tree
      of the Index you are creating. Likewise, the right half
      displays the images found in any node of the tree that you
      select. Initially, there will be just one node labeled "Image
      Index". You are able to add additional nodes to this node by
      using the menus below.</p>

      <h2>The Menus</h2>

      <p>The <b>File</b> menu shown with the Create/Edit Image Index
      pane contains three items:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Store Image Index</b>. This stores a permanent record
        of the Image Index that will be restored the next time the
        Panel Editor is opened. The Image Index will be included in
        the Catalog trees used by the Icon Editors.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Open a File System Directory</b>. This opens a file
          chooser dialog where you may open any directory that
          has image files. To open the directory, select any image
          file contained in it and a pane will attempt to display
          all the image files found in that directory.
          See <a href="../display/IconAdder.shtml">Icon
          Editors</a> for more details on this menu item.

          <br>The icons displayed in the "preview" panel of any
          directory window opened from this menu item can be added
          to the Image Index. How to do this is described
          below.
        </li>

        <li>
        <b>Search File System for Icons</b>. Opens a file chooser
        dialog to start a search for image files. A panel filled with
        all found image files is shown as the search finishes.<br>
        Drag one of the found icons to your Catalog.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <b>Edit</b> menu has three items:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Add Node</b>. First select a node in the Image Index
        tree. Then, use this menu item to add a sub-node the the
        selected node. A "sub-node" is a node that branches from
        under the selected node.</li>

        <li><b>Delete Node</b>. First select a node in the Image
        Index tree. Then, use this menu item to delete the node.
        Since this will also delete the nodes and icon references
        that branch off from under this node, a confirmation dialog
        is opened with the total of all the items that will be
        deleted.</li>

        <li><b>Rename Node</b>. First select a node in the Image
        Index tree. Then, use this menu item to change the name of
        the node.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Adding Icons to the Image Index</h2>

      <p>Use "Drag and Drop" to copy an icon from either the
      Catalog pane (left pane) or a File Directory window. Press
      the mouse button down on any icon appearing in the "preview"
      panel of either of these windows to "drag" the icon to a node
      of the Image Index tree (right pane). (Dragging means holding
      the mouse button down as you move the mouse pointer to a node
      of the Image Index tree.) Actually, it is only the reference
      to the location of the icon that is saved by the Image Index.
      As long the file remains in place, it will be displayed by
      the Catalog, the Image Index and your Panel (if you have
      installed it there).</p>

      <h2>Deleting and Renaming icons in the Image Index</h2>

      <p>Pressing and releasing (clicking) the mouse button over an
      icon in the preview pane of the Image Index activatea a
      "pop-up" menu. Pop-Up menus display the name and reference
      location of the icon. The pop-up also provides items to
      modify icons in the Image Index.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Rename Icon</b> opens a dialog box where a new name
        can be entered.</li>

        <li><b>Delete Icon</b> removes the icon from the Image
        Index node.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">
          <p>Note: <i>the "preview" pane will only show these
          changes after leaving the node and then returning to the
          node.</i></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
