      <p>This document explains some basic <b>programmer tabs</b>,
      and ideas on how to use them</p>

      <h3>Roster tab</h3>

      <p>A roster is a database of all locomotives that your
      installation of Decoder Pro has programmed. It includes the
      information seen in the screen below:</p>

      <p><img src="RosterTab.png"></p>

      <p>The first field "ID" becomes the file name in the Roster
      for the locomotive you are programming.</p>

      <p>The DCC Address Field is the active DCC address for this
      loco, see the <a href="#Basic">Basic Pane</a>.</p>

      <p>The Throttle Speed Limit sets the Maximum throttle
      percentage allowed.</p>

      <p>You can put any thing you want in the other fields.</p>

      <p>The Save button stores the current decoder information to
      your Roster folder. The default storage is in the same
      directory the Preferences are stored in.</p>

      <p>The "Reset to Defaults" button, not a "factory reset",
      returns the Decoder CVs to the Default value that was
      programmed into the decoder xml file. It does NOT change the
      values in the roster file on your hard disk, unless you Save
      it The Values are not written to the decoder until you select
      a to write them.</p>

      <p>Most decoders will activate the Reset Menu (next to the
      File menu at the top of the page). This is the "Factory
      Reset", some of the manufacturer has several reset routines.
      It does this by writing directly to a CV in the decoder, CV8
      in the case of Digitrax. All decoders may not support Factory
      Rest and how they work is manufacturer and decoder
      dependent.</p>

      <p><a name="Basic" id="Basic"></a></p>

      <h3>Basic Tab</h3>

      <p><img src="BasicTab.png"></p>

      <p>The Basic pane is where you set the Decoder address, you
      can set the short and the long address and then select which
      one is Active.</p>

      <p>The items that displayed may be different for each
      decoder. It depends on how the decoder definition file was
      written and what options the manufacture included in the
      decoder.</p>

      <p>You can select the Locomotive Direction. If you want the
      loco to go in the other direction set Reverse.</p>

      <p>The Speed Steps for the Loco can be selected, usually its
      28 steps.</p>

      <p>You can select wither the loco responds to DV voltage or
      not.</p>

      <p>You can enter any number you want into the "User id's"</p>

      <p>The Manufacture ID and the Manufacture Version ID are set
      in the decoder by the Manufacture. JMRI uses these to
      identify the decoder.</p>

      <p><a name="Other Tabs"></a></p>

      <h3>Other tabs</h3>The other tabs are dependent on what the
      manufacture installed in the decoder, if the options were not
      installed the panes are either gray or not enabled.

      <p><a name="Speed Table"></a></p>

      <h3>Speed Table Tab</h3>

      <p><img src="SpeedTab.png"></p>

      <p>This panel may look different depending on how the decoder
      xml was built. To use the Speed Table CV's usually the basic
      speed option needs to be turned off. The little boxes under
      each slider are very useful. To see how they work check one
      in the middle of the table then slide the last slider down.
      Notice that the values do not change below the one you
      checked. They also do not change for steps above if a lower
      step is changed.</p>
