<p>
A roster is a database of all locomotives that your installation
of Decoder Pro has programmed. It includes the information seen in the screen
below:

<p>

</p>



<p>
The first field "ID" becomes the file name in the Roster for the locomotive you are programming.
<p>The DCC Address Field is  the active DCC address for this loco, see the <a href="#Basic">Basic Pane</a>.
<p>The Throttle Speed Limit sets the Maximum throttle percentage allowed.

<p>
You can put any thing you want in the other fields.

<p>
The Save button stores the  current decoder information to your Roster folder. The default storage is in the 
same directory the Preferences are stored in. 

<p>
The "Reset to Defaults" button, not a "factory reset", returns the Decoder CVs to the Default value that was programmed 
into the decoder xml file. It does NOT change the values in the roster  file on your hard disk, unless you 
Save it  The Values are not written to the decoder until you select a  to write them. 

<p>
Most decoders will activate the Reset Menu (next to the File menu at  the top of the page).
This is the "Factory Reset", some of the manufacturer has several reset routines. It does this by writing directly to 
a CV in  the decoder, CV8 in the case of Digitrax. All  decoders may not support Factory Rest and how they work is manufacturer and decoder  dependent.</p>

 

<p>
<a NAME="Basic"></a><H3>Basic Tab</H3></a>

</p>

<p>The Basic pane is where you set the Decoder address, you can set the short and the long address and then select which one is Active.
<p>The items that displayed may be different for each decoder. It depends on how the decoder definition file was written and what options the manufacture included in the decoder.

<p>You can select the Locomotive Direction. If you want the loco to go in the other direction set Reverse. 
<p>The Speed Steps for the Loco can be selected, usually its 28 steps.
<p>You can select wither the loco responds to DV voltage or not. 
<p>You can enter any number you want into the &quot;User id's&quot; 
<p>The Manufacture ID and the Manufacture Version ID are set in the decoder by the Manufacture. JMRI uses 
these to identify the decoder.
<p>
<a NAME="Other Tabs"></a>
<h3>Other tabs</h3>
The other tabs are dependent on what the manufacture installed in the decoder, if the options were not installed 
the panes are either gray or not enabled.
  
<p>
<a name="Speed Table"></a>
<H3>Speed Table Tab</H3>
<p>
<img src="SpeedTab.png" >
</p>
<p>
This panel may look different depending on how the decoder xml was built. To use the Speed Table CV's usually the 
basic speed option needs to be turned off. The little boxes under each slider are very useful. To see how they 
work check one in the middle of the table then slide the last slider down. Notice that the values do not change 
below the one you checked. They also do not change for steps above if a lower step is changed.
