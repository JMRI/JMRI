      <h1>Speedometer</h1>

      <p>The Speedometer measures the time from one sensor to another, then calculates the speed by
      calculating the distance covered by the time taken.</p>

      <p>Enter a Sensor Sysname in 'starts timers on' field. Then enter another Sensor Sysname in
      the 'stops timer 1 on' field. Measure the distance between the two, convert that into feet
      for your scale and enter that into the 'Distance 1' field.</p>

      <p>The speed of your train between the two Sensors will be displayed in the 'Timer 1 Speed'
      field.</p>

      <p>You can add a third Sensor in the 'stops timer 2 on' field and that will give the speed
      between the starts sensor and that sensor in the 'Timer 2 Speed' field. You also need to
      enter the value in the 'Distance 2' field in scale feet between the start sensor and this
      sensor.</p>

      <p>You can select to trigger the start/end of the timers with the entry or exit buttons. The
      indicators on the right side of the pane is the state sensors you selected.</p>
