<H2>Setup Fast Clock
</H2>
    
The JMRI internal fast clock system consists of two parts:
A "Timebase" provides the basic
time information, while one or more displays show you what's going on.
<P>
This window (reached from "Setup Fast Clock" item in the 
"Clocks" submenu under the "Tools" menu) is where you set up the
internal timebase.

<P>
To configure the time base, you can:
<UL>
<LI>Select the timebase source to control (typically, this is the internal computer
clock)
<LI>Set the rate at which the clock runs
<LI>Set the time
<LI>Start and stop the clock
</UL>

Once you have created a timebase by configuring it in this window, you 
can open clocks that will display on your screen. Currently, JMRI has three
types available:
<UL>
<LI>Analog clock - the traditional circular clock with hands.  You can resize
it by dragging the window edges.  There's also a pause/run button.
<LI>Nixie clock - a digital clock that looks like the old-style Nixie tubes
<LI>Panel clock - you can also embed a clock in a panel (instead of a separate window)
from the panel editor.
</UL>
