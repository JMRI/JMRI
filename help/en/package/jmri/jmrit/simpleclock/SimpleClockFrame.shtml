    <h1>Fast Clock Setup </h1>

    <h2>Introduction to JMRI Fast Clocks</h2>
      <p>JMRI provides a fast
      clock that can get its time from an internal fast clock or a
      selected hardware fast clock if one exists on your layout.</p>

      <p>This window ( Tools > Clocks > Set up Fast Clock )
      provides for setting options for this fast clock system.</p>


      <p>Information you set up here is saved when you save your
      panels and configuration and allows you to set start
      up options that take effect when you load your panels and
      configuration.</p>

      <p>JMRI also has clock displays that can run in
      stand-alone dialogs or on a PanelPro panel.</p>

      alt="Fast Clock Setup config pane" style="float:right"></a>

    <h2>Pausing and Running the Fast Clock</h2>
      <p>Your fast clock may be set paused or running by using the : </p>

      <ul>
      <li><b>Pause Clock / Run Clock</b> button at the top of this setup window.</li>
      <li><b>Pause / Run</b> button at the bottom or side of a clock window.</li>
      <li>Internal sensor with system name <b><i><a href="#isclockrunning">ISCLOCKRUNNING</a></i></b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>When the fast clock is resumed after having been paused,
      the fast clock time continues where it left off.</p>
      <p>The current fast time is displayed at the top of the screen, the tooltip of
      which displays the full date, time and timezone.</p>


    <h2>Setting Fast Clock Time and Fast Clock Rate</h2>

      <p>The <b>Fast Clock Time</b> is entered as hours and minutes
      using a 24-hour clock. After entry click the <b>Set</b>
      button, the time is updated and broadcast to synchronized clocks.</p>

      <p>The <b>Fast Clock Rate</b> is a factor that multiplies the
      wall clock time rate. <br>For example, a fast clock rate of 4.000
      means that the fast clock will run 4 times faster than the
      wall clock, or will move an hour when the wall clock only
      moves 15 minutes.</p>

      <p>Enter your fast clock rate after <b>Fast
      Clock Rate:</b>, then click the <b>Set</b> button to the
      right of it.</p>
      <p>It's important that
      all clocks run with the same rate, even if they are
      synchronized.</p>

      <p>If any of the entered values are not right, an error message
      is displayed, and the time / rate is not changed.
      </p>





    <h2>Setting up your Time Source</h2>

      <p>Look in the <b>Time Source</b> selection box to see what
      might be available for your system. If you don't have a
      hardware fast clock, skip to the next section.</p>

      <p>Usually you
      will want to select <b>Internal Computer Clock</b> even if a
      hardware fast clock is available. Usually also you will want
      to check <b>Synchronize Internal Fast Clock with xxxxx Fast
      Clock</b> so that the two clocks will show the same time,
      even over long periods.
      <br>Both the <b>Fast Clock Rate</b> and
      the <b>Fast Clock Time</b> are synchronized when you check
      this option.</p>

      <p>For some hardware fast clocks another check box,
      <b>Correct hardware clock</b>, will be shown.
      <br>If you tried
      using your DCC command station to create a fast clock, you
      may have noticed that it didn't keep particularly good time.
      <br>If <b>Correct hardware clock</b> is available and you check
      it, JMRI will adjust the rate of your hardware clock so that
      it keeps better time.</p>

      <p>Some hardware fast clocks support changing a
      12-hour/24-hour display option from the computer.
      <br>For those
      that do, a check box labeled <b>Use 12-hour clock
      display</b>, will be shown.
      <br>If you check this option, your
      hardware clock will set up for a 12-hour clock display.
      <br>If
      this option is unchecked (the default), a 24-hour clock
      display will be set up.</p>

      <p>If you select <b>Internal Computer Clock</b> as your time
      source, and do not check either the <b>Synchronize...</b> or
      <b>Correct...</b> options, only the internal clock will be
      used, and no commands will be sent to your hardware clock.</p>

      <p>At
      the end of this documentation there is more information on
      specific hardware fast clocks, which includes recommendations on
      the best way to set them up.</p>

      <p><b>Caution: This window may show you have a time source
      when you really don't have one.</b> For example, if
      you're running LocoNet Simulator, a LocoNet Fast Clock will
      be listed but doesn't exist. Unless you know you have the
      hardware fast clock listed, you should not select the
      hardware clock as your Time Source, and you should not check
      either the <b>Synchronize...</b> or <b>Correct...</b> options
      even if they show on this window.</p>

    <h2>Setting Start Up Options</h2>

      <p>The options set in this section take effect when you load
      your panel file (or configuration file if you don't have any
      panels).</p>

      <p>The clock can be started up paused or running, depending on the selection.

      <p>You can request that your fast clock start at a
      specified time, by checking <b>Set Fast Clock Time to</b> and
      entering the time after it.
      <br>As with <b>Fast Clock Time</b>,
      the time is entered as hours and minutes using a 24-hour
      clock.</p>

      <p>If you select a display clock in the <b>Start Selected
      Clock</b> popup menu, that clock display will be
      automatically started when your file is loaded.
      <br>Clocks displayed on a PanelPro panel are configured
      using Panel Editor or Layout Editor, and are saved and
      restarted with your panel.</p>

      <p><b>Important Note: To preserve the settings and options
      entered in this dialog, you must save your configuration.</b>
      <br>Fast clock settings are stored as part of your configuration
      in the same file as your panels (if you have any).

      <br>The safest
      and easiest way to ensure that all your configuration items
      and panels are saved is to save using <b>Store Configuration
      and panels...</b>. (<b>Store panels...</b> may be used even
      if you don't have any panels.)
      <a href="images/FastClockSetupSave.png">
      <img src="images/FastClockSetupSave.png" width="333" height="140"
      alt="Fast Clock Setup config pane" style="float:right"></a>
      <b>Store</b> options may be found in the <b>File</b> menu
      while working on the Fast Clock Setup. A prompt will give
      you the option to save either form when you close the
      Fast Clock Setup by clicking Apply.</p>

      <p>The clock settings are stored with table content and panels.
      See <a href="../../../../html/apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">Loading and Storing Your Work</a> for details.

    <h2><a name="isclockrunning" id="isclockrunning">Clock-related Sensor and Memory</a></h2>
      <p>When a clock is
      running, JMRI creates an internal sensor and a memory
      variable that you can use to control and access the clock.</p>

      <p>The ISCLOCKRUNNING sensor controls whether the clock is
      running (ACTIVE) or stopped (INACTIVE).</p>

      <p>The state of this sensor
      automatically follows the state of the fast
      clock-<b>Active</b> if the fast clock is running, and
      <b>Inactive</b> if the fast clock is paused. </p>

      <p>You could add a <b>Sensor Icon</b> on your PanelPro panel
      (Panel Editor or Layout Editor). Changing the
      state of this sensor will run and pause your fast clock.</p>

      <p>Regardless of which method you use to run and pause your
      fast clock, button labels and the
      <b><i>ISCLOCKRUNNING</i></b> sensor's state follow along.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>The IMCURRENTTIME memory contains the current fast-clock
      time, and can be easily accessed from Logix and scripts.</p>

      <p>The
      format of the time / date string is controlled by the
      jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockBundle TimeStorageFormat
      property, and can be changed via the JMRI <a href=
      "../../../../html/doc/Technical/I8N.shtml">Internationalization</a>
      mechanism. More information on the DateFormat mechanism used
      for this is available <a href=
      "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">
      here</a>.</p>
