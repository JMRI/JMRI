      <h1>Fast Clock Setup </h1>

      <h2>Introduction to JMRI Fast Clocks</h2>
      <p>JMRI provides a fast
      clock that can get its time from an internal fast clock or a
      selected hardware fast clock if one exists on your DCC
      system. This dialog (reached from <b>Set up Fast Clock</b> in
      the <b>Clocks</b> submenu under the <b>Tools</b> menu)
      provides for setting options for this fast clock system.
      Information you set up here is saved when you save your
      panels and configuration. This dialog allows you to set start
      up options that take effect when you load your panels and
      configuration. JMRI also has clock displays that can run in
      stand-alone dialogs or on a PanelPro panel.</p>

      <h3>Setting up your Time Source</h3>

      <p>Look in the <b>Time Source</b> popup menu to see what
      might be available for your system. If you don't have a
      hardware fast clock, skip to the next section. Usually you
      will want to select <b>Internal Computer Clock</b> even if a
      hardware fast clock is available. Usually also you will want
      to check <b>Synchronize Internal Fast Clock with xxxxx Fast
      Clock</b> so that the two clocks will show the same time,
      even over long periods. Both the <b>Fast Clock Rate</b> and
      the <b>Fast Clock Time</b> are synchronized when you check
      this option.</p>

      <p>For some hardware fast clocks another check box,
      <b>Correct hardware clock</b>, will be shown. If you tried
      using your DCC command station to create a fast clock, you
      may have noticed that it didn't keep particularly good time.
      If <b>Correct hardware clock</b> is available and you check
      it, JMRI will adjust the rate of your hardware clock so that
      it keeps better time.</p>

      <p>Not all hardware fast clocks support changing a
      12-hour/24-hour display option from the computer. For those
      that do, a check box labeled <b>Use 12-hour clock
      display</b>, will be shown. If you check this option, your
      hardware clock will set up for a 12-hour clock display. If
      this option is unchecked (the default), a 24-hour clock
      display will be set up.</p>

      <p>If you select <b>Internal Computer Clock</b> as your time
      source, and do not check either the <b>Synchronize...</b> or
      <b>Correct...</b> options, only the internal clock will be
      used, and no commands will be sent to your hardware clock. At
      the end of this documentation there is more information on
      specific hardware fast clocks, including recommendations on
      the best way to set them up.</p>

      <p><b>Caution: This dialog may show you have a hardware fast
      clock when you really don't have one.</b> For example, if
      you're running LocoNet Simulator, a LocoNet Fast Clock will
      be listed but doesn't exist. Unless you know you have the
      hardware fast clock listed, you should not select the
      hardware clock as your Time Source, and you should not check
      either the <b>Synchronize...</b> or <b>Correct...</b> options
      even if they show on this dialog.</p>

      <h2>Setting Fast Clock Rate and Fast Clock Time</h2>

      <p>The <b>Fast Clock Rate</b> is a factor that multiplies the
      wall clock time rate. For example, a fast clock rate of 4.000
      means that the fast clock will run 4 times faster than the
      wall clock, or will move an hour when the wall clock only
      moves 15 minutes. Enter your fast clock rate after <b>Fast
      Clock Rate:</b>, then click the <b>Set</b> button to the
      right of it. When this button is pushed, JMRI checks the
      value you entered. If anything is not right, an error message
      is displayed and nothing is changed. If the entered rate
      checks out, it is sent to all clocks. (It's important that
      all clocks run with the same rate, even if they are
      synchronized.)</p>

      <p>The <b>Fast Clock Time</b> is entered as hours and minutes
      using a 24-hour clock. After entry click the <b>Set</b>
      button, so JMRI will check the entered time. If anything is
      not right, an error message is displayed, and the time is not
      changed. If the entry checks out, the time is immediately
      changed on all clocks.</p>

      <h2>Setting Start Up Options</h2>

      <p>The options set in this section take effect when you load
      your panel file (or configuration file if you don't have any
      panels). If <b>Start with Fast Clock Stopped</b> is checked,
      your fast clock will start up stopped (paused). If not
      checked, your fast clock will start running immediately after
      loading. You can request that your fast clock start at a
      specified time, by checking <b>Set Fast Clock Time to</b> and
      entering the time after it. As with <b>Fast Clock Time</b>,
      the time is entered as hours and minutes using a 24-hour
      clock. After you enter the time, be sure to hit the
      <b>Set</b> button so the time will be read into the
      computer.</p>

      <p>If you select a display clock in the <b>Start Selected
      Clock</b> popup menu, that clock display will be
      automatically started when your file is loaded. This option
      only applies to clock displays that run in a stand-alone
      window. Clocks displayed on a PanelPro panel are configured
      using Panel Editor or Layout Editor, and are saved and
      restarted with your panel.</p>

      <p><b>Important Note: To preserve the settings and options
      entered in this dialog, you must save your configuration.</b>
      Fast clock settings are stored as part of your configuration
      in the same file as your panels (if you have any). The safest
      and easiest way to ensure that all your configuration items
      and panels are saved is to save using <b>Store Configuration
      and panels...</b>. (<b>Store panels...</b> may be used even
      if you don't have any panels.)
      <a href="images/FastClockSetupSave.png">
      <img src="images/FastClockSetupSave.png" width="333" height="140"
      alt="Fast Clock Setup config pane" align="right"></a>
      <b>Store</b> options may be found in the <b>File</b> menu
      while working on the Fast Clock Setup. A prompt will give
      you the option to save either form when you close the
      Fast Clock Setup by clicking Apply.</p>
      <p>If you want to automatically load your panel
      file when your application starts, add it to <b>Load panel
      file at startup:</b> in the <b>Advanced Preferences</b>
      section of your <b>Preferences...</b> window.</p>

      <h2>Starting and Stopping the Fast Clock</h2>

      <p>Your fast clock may be started and stopped using the
      <b>Start Clock/Stop Clock</b> buttons at the bottom of this
      dialog. Or you can use the <b>Run/Pause</b> button at the
      bottom of the Analog Clock. Or you can click on a <b>Sensor
      Icon</b> on your PanelPro panel (Panel Editor or Layout
      Editor) that you've linked to the internal sensor with system
      name <b><i>ISCLOCKRUNNING</i></b>. The state of this sensor
      automatically follows the state of the fast
      clock-<b>Active</b> if the fast clock is running, and
      <b>Inactive</b> if the fast clock is stopped. Changing the
      state of this sensor will start and stop your fast clock.
      Regardless of which method you use to start and stop your
      fast clock, button labels and the
      <b><i>ISCLOCKRUNNING</i></b> sensor's state follow along.
      When the fast clock is restarted after having been stopped,
      the fast clock time continues where it left off.</p>

      <h2>Supported Hardware Clocks</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>LocoNet Fast Clock</b> - A Digitrax LocoNet can
          contain it's own fast clock, driven by the DCS100,
          DCS200, or DCS50 command stations. A separate LocoNet
          fast clock is available from Logic Rail Technologies.
          JMRI can work with any of these, or with any clock that
          uses the standard Digitrax method to control fast clocks.
          The recommended settings for running with these clocks
          is: set <b>Time Source</b> to <b>Internal Computer
          Clock</b>, and check both the <b>Synchronize...</b> and
          <b>Correct...</b> options. However you can try other
          settings. If you use the internal computer clock as the
          time source, you will not be able to change the fast
          clock rate or the fast clock time from a throttle.</p>

          <p>If you use a Logic Rail Technologies fast clock, it
          should be set up as a slave clock, not as a master. You
          may notice that the Logic Rail Technologies fast clock
          lags behind by one fast clock minute. Be assured that the
          correct commands are being sent by JMRI. This lag, if
          present, is just an artifact of the Logic Rail clock's
          internal programming.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>NCE Fast Clock</b> - The NCE fast clock can be
          either a source of fast time or can be commanded to
          follow the internal clock. The best synchronization is
          when the NCE clock is the master source. It works by
          adjusting the internal clock ratio so the fast minutes
          will be the same. The provides for the clocks to be
          basically in sync all the time. Adjustments are made
          about every 20 fast seconds.</p>

          <p>You may also have the internal clock drive the NCE
          fast clock. However, this requires some number of seconds
          to be added or skipped in the NCE fast clock so the
          minutes will roll over at the same time. That minute roll
          over is critical for the NCE as that is when the time is
          sent to all the Pro cabs. Due to limited adjustments in
          the NCE fast clock this method causes the clock to run
          fast for part of the minute and slow for the other part
          of the minute so the minute roll over is correct.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Clock-related Sensor and Memory</h2>
      <p>When a clock is
      running, JMRI creates an internal sensor and a memory
      variable that you can use to control and access the clock.</p>

      <p>The ISCLOCKRUNNING sensor controls whether the clock is
      running (ACTIVE) or stopped (INACTIVE).</p>

      <p>The IMCURRENTTIME memory contains the current fast-clock
      time, and can be easily accessed from Logix and scripts. The
      format of the time/date string is controlled by the
      jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockBundle TimeStorageFormat
      property, and can be changed via the JMRI <a href=
      "../../../../html/doc/Technical/I8N.shtml">Internationalization</a>
      mechanism. More information on the DateFormat mechanism used
      for this is available <a href=
      "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">
      here</a>.</p>
