    <h1>JMRI: Entry/Exit (NX) Tool</h1>

    For a full description of Entry/Exit (NX), see
    <a href="../../../../html/tools/EntryExit.shtml">Entry/Exit (NX)
    Documentation</a>.

    <h2>Add Entry/Exit Points</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Add Entry Exit Points</strong> pane is accessed from the
    Layout Editor <b>Tools</b> menu.<br>
    It is used to create and delete Entry Exit Pairs for a given Layout Editor
    panel. It is also used to enable the <b>Both Way</b> option and to
    enable/disable specific NX Pairs by checking the boxes in the corresponding
    column.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <a href="images/EntryExitWindow.png">
      <img src="images/EntryExitWindow.png" height="517" width="896"
      alt="NX Window"></a>
    </div>

    <p>NX Panel Sensors are assigned at <strong>Block</strong> boundaries
    on the Layout Editor panel by using the pop up menu on anchor points,
    turnouts, level crossings, end bumpers and edge connectors.<br>
    These sensors act as the NX selection buttons and are used to create the
    <strong>Entry Point</strong> and <strong>Exit Point</strong> combo box
    content.</p>

    <h3>Combo Boxes</h3>
    <p>When the Add Entry/Exit Points pane is first opened, the <strong>Select
    Panel</strong> selection will be the current Layout Editor panel.<br>
    Use the top combo box to configure NX settings for another panel.<br>
    The <strong>Entry Point</strong> combo box list now
    contains the sensors for the currently selected panel. The <strong>Exit
    Point</strong> list will contain all of the sensors from all layout editor
    panels.</p>
    <p><em>The Exit Point can be on another panel as long as the panels
    are linked using edge connectors.</em><span class="since">since 4.11.1</span></p>
    <p>The <strong>
    <a href="../../../../html/tools/EntryExit.shtml#nxtypes">NX Type</a></strong>
    defaults to <strong>Set Turnouts Only</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <p>At the center of the pane are two buttons to populate the NX Pair Table:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Add Pair</strong> &mdash; Select sensors from the Entry Point
    and Exit Point lists, select the NX Type and click on <b>Add Pair</b>.
    <strong>Notice:</strong> <em>The sensor pair is not checked for validity</em>.</li>

    <li><strong>Auto Generate Entry-Exit Pairs</strong> &mdash; The auto generate
    process will find all of the valid sensor pairs on all of the panels using
    the Layout Editor Block routing utilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>NX Pair Table Columns</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entry</strong> &mdash; The sensor name for the entry point. If the
      block boundary has a signal mast, it will be listed in parenthesis.</li>
      <li><strong>Exit</strong> &mdash; The sensor name for the exit point. If the
      block boundary has a signal mast, it will be listed in parenthesis.</li>
      <li><strong>Active</strong> &mdash; Yes when there is a active route.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear</strong> &mdash; If the entry is active, cancel the route
      segment.</li>
      <li><strong>Both Way</strong> &mdash; Enable the ability to press the entry
      and exit buttons in either order.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete</strong> &mdash; Delete the NX sensor pair.</li>
      <li><strong>NX Type</strong> &mdash; The selected NX type for the NX sensor
      pair.</li>
      <li><strong>Disabled</strong> &mdash; When checked, the NX pair is Inactive.
      Attempts to create a route will result in a error dialog.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>NX Options</h2>
    <p><img src="images/NxOptionsPane.png" width="394" height="194"
    alt="NX Window" align="right">While the Entry/Exit (NX) Tools is displayed,
    its Options menu allows you to set shared settings for the tool.<br>
    The <b>Entry Exit Options</b> pane contains the following items:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Route Re-selection Result</strong> &mdash; Determines what should occur when the
    NX route is reselected by the user.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prompt User - Ask the user what they would like to do.</li>
      <li>Clear Route - Automatically clear the route down. The blocks in the
      route will become active and then inactive as if a train had traversed
      the route. The final block will left active.</li>
      <li>Cancel Route - Cancel the route.</li>
      <li>Stack Route - Stack the route.<span class="since">since 3.4</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Initial color of path while route it set up</strong> &mdash;
    While the route is being setup, set the track color to that in the drop
    down, after a predetermined time the track will revert back to that defined
    in the block configuration.</p>

    <p><strong>Duration of setting Color (ms)</strong> &mdash; How long the
    initial color will be displayed for after the route has initially been
    selected.</p>

    <p><strong>Integrate with Dispatcher</strong> &mdash; Select this option if
    the NX route is to extend the path of an <b>Active Train</b> in the
    <a href="../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a> module.<br>
    This option will only work if the Block prior to the NX route
    is allocated to a Dispatcher Active Train and that Block is also the
    end block.</p>
