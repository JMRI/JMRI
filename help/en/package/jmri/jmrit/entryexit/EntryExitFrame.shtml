    <h1>JMRI: Entry/Exit (NX) Tool</h1>

    For a full description of Entry/Exit (NX), see
    <a href="../../../../html/tools/EntryExit.shtml">Entry/Exit (NX)
    Documentation</a>.

    <h2>Add Entry/Exit Points</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Add Entry Exit Points</strong> pane is accessed from the
    Layout Editor <b>Tools</b> menu.<br>
    It is used to create and delete Entry Exit Pairs for a given Layout Editor
    panel. It is also used to enable the <b>Both Way</b> option and to
    enable/disable specific NX Pairs by checking the boxes in the corresponding
    column.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <a href="images/EntryExitWindow.png">
      <img src="images/EntryExitWindow.png" height="517" width="896"
      alt="NX Window"></a>
    </div>

    <p>NX Panel Sensors are assigned at <strong>Block</strong> boundaries
    on the Layout Editor panel by using the pop up menu on anchor points,
    turnouts, level crossings, end bumpers and edge connectors.<br>
    These sensors act as the NX selection buttons and are used to create the
    <strong>Entry Point</strong> and <strong>Exit Point</strong> combo box
    content.</p>

    <h3>Combo Boxes</h3>
    <p>When the Add Entry/Exit Points pane is first opened, the <strong>Select
    Panel</strong> selection will be the current Layout Editor panel.<br>
    Use the top combo box to configure NX settings for another panel.<br>
    The <strong>Entry Point</strong> combo box list now
    contains the sensors for the currently selected panel. The <strong>Exit
    Point</strong> list will contain all of the sensors from all layout editor
    panels.</p>
    <p><em>The Exit Point can be on another panel as long as the panels
    are linked using edge connectors.</em><span class="since">since 4.11.1</span></p>
    <p>The <strong>
    <a href="../../../../html/tools/EntryExit.shtml#nxtypes">NX Type</a></strong>
    defaults to <strong>Set Turnouts Only</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <p>At the center of the pane are two buttons to populate the NX Pair Table:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Add Pair</strong> &mdash; Select sensors from the Entry Point
    and Exit Point lists, select the NX Type and click on <b>Add Pair</b>.
    <strong>Notice:</strong> <em>The sensor pair is not checked for validity</em>.</li>

    <li><strong>Auto Generate Entry-Exit Pairs</strong> &mdash; The auto generate
    process will find all of the valid sensor pairs on all of the panels using
    the Layout Editor Block routing utilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>NX Pair Table Columns</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entry</strong> &mdash; The sensor name for the entry point. If the
      block boundary has a signal mast, it will be listed in parenthesis.</li>
      <li><strong>Exit</strong> &mdash; The sensor name for the exit point. If the
      block boundary has a signal mast, it will be listed in parenthesis.</li>
      <li><strong>Active</strong> &mdash; Yes when there is a active route.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear</strong> &mdash; If the entry is active, cancel the route
      segment.</li>
      <li><strong>Both Way</strong> &mdash; Enable the ability to press the entry
      and exit buttons in either order.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete</strong> &mdash; Delete the NX sensor pair.</li>
      <li><strong>NX Type</strong> &mdash; The selected NX type for the NX sensor
      pair.</li>
      <li><strong>Disabled</strong> &mdash; When checked, the NX pair is Inactive.
      Attempts to create a route will result in a error dialog.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>NX Options</h2>
    <p><img src="images/NxOptionsPane.png" width="392" height="304"
    alt="NX Options Window" align="right">While the Entry/Exit (NX) Tools is displayed,
    its Options menu allows you to set shared settings for the tool.<br>
    The <b>Entry Exit Options</b> pane contains the following items:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Route Reselection Result</strong> &mdash; Determines what should occur when the
    NX route is reselected by the user.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prompt User - Ask the user what they would like to do.</li>
      <li>Clear Route - Automatically clear the route down. The blocks in the
      route will become active and then inactive as if a train had traversed
      the route. The final block will left active.</li>
      <li>Cancel Route - Cancel the route.</li>
      <li>Stack Route - Stack the route.<span class="since">since 3.4</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The next 3 items provide alternate options for using NX when panels are displayed
    using the JMRI Web Server.  The web server cannot handle dialogs so default responses
    are necessary along with an alternate method for displaying route allocation messages.
    Note:  The Web interface does not support flashing NX icons.<span class="since">since 4.19.3</span></p>

    <p><strong>Route Overlap Result</strong> &mdash; Determines what should occur when the
    NX route overlaps an active route.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prompt User - Ask the user what they would like to do.</li>
      <li>Cancel Route - Cancel the proposed route.</li>
      <li>Stack Route - Stack the route.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Memory Variable (Optional)</strong> &mdash; Select a memory variable that
    will contain any route allocation messages.  This provides feedback that can be added
    to a panel.  This helpful when the route overlap is set to cancel or stack since the
    dialog is not displayed, such as when using browser based panels.  The message will
    be cleared when the next route is selected or after a delay (see below).</p>

    <p><strong>Automatic Memory Clear Delay</strong> &mdash; Automatically clear the memory
    variable after a number of seconds.  Set to 0 to disable automatic memory clearing.</p>

    <p><strong>Initial color of path while route it set up</strong> &mdash;
    While the route is being setup, set the track color to that in the drop
    down, after a predetermined time the track will revert back to that defined
    in the block configuration.</p>

    <p><strong>Duration of setting Color (ms)</strong> &mdash; How long the
    initial color will be displayed for after the route has initially been
    selected.</p>

    <p><strong>Integrate with Dispatcher</strong> &mdash; Select this option if
    the NX route is to extend the path of an <b>Active Train</b> in the
    <a href="../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a> module.<br>
    This option will only work if the Block prior to the NX route
    is allocated to a Dispatcher Active Train and that Block is also the
    end block.</p>
