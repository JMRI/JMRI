    <h1>JMRI: Entry/Exit (NX) Tools</h1>

    For a full description of Entry/Exit (NX), see
    <a href="../../../../html/tools/EntryExit.shtml">Entry/Exit (NX)
    Documentation</a>.

    <h2>Entry/Exit (NX) Window</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Add Entry Exit Points</strong> window is used to create
    and delete Entry Exit Pairs for a given layout panel. It is also used to
    enable the Both Way option and enable/disable NX Pairs. The panel is
    accessed from the Layout Editor Tools menu.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em">
    <img src="images/EntryExitWindow.png" height="517" width="896" alt="NX Window">
    </div>

    <p>Sensors are assigned at <strong>block</strong> boundaries
    on the layout editor panel by using the pop up window on anchor points,
    turnouts, level crossings, end bumpers and edge connectors. These sensors
    act as the NX selection buttons and are used to create the
    <strong>Entry Point</strong> and <strong>Exit Point</strong> combo box
    content.</p>

    <p>When the panel is opened, the <strong>Select Panel</strong> selection
    will be the current layout editor panel. Use the combo box to select the
    NX content for other panels.  The <strong>Entry Point</strong> list
    contains the sensors for the currently selected panel.  The <strong>Exit
    Point</strong> list contains all of the sensors from all layout editor
    panels. <em>The Exit Point can be on another panel as long as the panels
    are linked using edge connectors.</em><span class="since">since 4.11.1</span></p>
    <p>The <strong>NX Type</strong> defaults to <strong>Set Turnouts
    Only</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Add Pair</strong> &mdash; Select sensors from the Entry Point
    and Exit Point lists, select the NX Type and click on Add Pair.
    <strong>Notice:</strong> <em>The sensor pair is not checked for validity</em>.</li>

    <li><strong>Auto Generate Entry-Exit Pairs</strong> &mdash; The auto generate
    process will find all of the valid sensors pairs on all of the panels using
    the layout block routing utilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Columns</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Entry</strong> &mdash; The sensor name for the entry point. If the
    block boundary has a signal mast, it will be listed in parenthesis.</li>
    <li><strong>Exit</strong> &mdash; The sensor name for the exit point. If the
    block boundary has a signal mast, it will be listed in parenthesis.</li>
    <li><strong>Active</strong> &mdash; Yes when there is a active route.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear</strong> &mdash; If the entry is active, cancel the route
    segment.</li>
    <li><strong>Both Way</strong> &mdash; Enable the ability to press the entry
    and exit buttons in either order.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> &mdash; Delete the NX sensor pair.</li>
    <li><strong>NX Type</strong> &mdash; The selected NX type for the NX sensor
    pair.</li>
    <li><strong>Disabled</strong> &mdash; When checked, the NX pair is Inactive.
    Attempts to create a route will result in a error dialog.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Options</h2>
    <p><strong>Route Re-selection</strong> &mdash; Determines what should occur when the
    NX route is reselected by the user.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prompt User - Ask the user what they would like to do.</li>
      <li>Clear Route - Automatically clear the route down. The blocks in the
      route will become active and then inactive as if a train had traversed
      the route. The final block will left active.</li>
      <li>Cancel Route - Cancel the route.</li>
      <li>Stack Route - Stack the route.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Initial colour of path while route it Setup</strong> &mdash;
    While the route is being setup, set the track colour to that in the drop
    down, after a predetermined time the track will revert back to that defined
    in the block configuration.</p>

    <p><strong>Duration of setting Colour(ms)</strong> &mdash; How long the
    initial colour will be displayed for after the route has initial been
    selected.</p>

    <p><strong>Integrate With Dispatcher</strong> &mdash; Select this option if
    the NX route is to extend the path of an Active Train in the
    dispatcher. This option will only work if the block prior to the NX route
    is allocated to an active train and that block is also the end block.</p>
