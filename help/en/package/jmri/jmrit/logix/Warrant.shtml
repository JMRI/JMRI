      <h1>JMRI: Warrants</h1>
      <p>A Warrant in JMRI is a collection of information
      sufficient to run an automated train. It will set the
      turnouts for a specified route and drive the train over the
      route. When running, using block occupancy detection and
      signal configuration, it will make a best effort to control
      speed according to signal aspects or by occupancy of other
      trains or other track conditions ahead.<br>
      A JMRI Warrant is suggestive of what
      a warrant does on a prototype railroad, but there is no
      intention to replicate any particular railroad's mode of
      operation. It is simply the idea of giving an automated train
      the trackage rights to move from point A to point B (and then
      move it along). Warrants are issued using the
      <a href="../display/ControlPanelEditor.shtml">Control Panel
      Editor</a> and the <a href="WarrantTable.shtml">The Warrants
      List</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Warrants</b> depend on having an accurate description
      of the layout in terms of <b>OBlocks</b>, <b>Portals</b> and
      <b>OPaths</b>.<br><span class="since">since 2.7.8</span>
      These elements are created by entering data into the
      <b><a href="OBlockTable.shtml">Occupancy Block Tables</a></b>
      or by using the graphical interface of the
      <b>Circuit Builder</b>, part of Control Panel Editor. Initially
      however, these tools are not visible in the Panel Editor
      as they require some preparations, described next.</p>

      <h2>Get Started with Warrants</h2>
	  Definitions of OBlocks, Portals and OPaths may be found
      <a href="OBlockTable.shtml">here</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>First, it is important that the <b>scale</b> of your layout
        is known so that the Warrant can compute the distances required
        when encountering signals. Open the <b>Warrants</b> pane of JMRI
        <b><a href="NXWarrant.shtml#prefs">Preferences</a></b> to set
        the layout scale. There are other parameters related to Warrants
        there that you may wish to change later, but the defaults are
        generally sufficient without further change. See
        <a href="NXWarrant.shtml#prefs">Warrant Preferences</a>
        for information about configuration of Warrant parameters.</li>

        <li>Next, open the Occupancy Block Tables by choosing
        the <b>Tools-&gt;Tables-&gt;Occupancy Blocks</b> menu item
        from the main PanelPro menu bar, or the <b>Add
        Items-&gt;Occupancy Blocks</b> menu item
        from within Control Panel Editor.</li>

        <li>Create your OBlocks, Portals and OPaths using these
        tables, as described in <a href="OBlockEdit.shtml">Creating
        and Editing OBlocks, Portals and OPaths</a>.</li>

        <li>OBlocks, Portals and Paths can also be created using the
        <b>Circuit Builder</b> tool found in the Control Panel
        Editor. Using that tool, OBlocks, Portals and OPaths are
        defined by selecting track icons of your layout diagram.
        The Circuit Builder can be opened using the <b>Open
        Circuit Builder</b> menu item under the <b>Warrants</b>
        menu. Follow the
        <a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit
        Builder</a> instructions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Circuit Builder Tool</h2>
      <span class="since">since 2.12</span>
      <p>Circuit Builder is an interactive tool that creates OBlocks,
      Portals and Paths graphically. In order to use the tool, you
      need to have a track diagram of your layout expressed with
      track icons (track segments and turnout icons) in a Control
      Panel Editor panel. OBlocks and OPaths are created by clicking
      on the track icons.
      The Circuit Builder can convert the track segments and turnout
      icons of your Panel into Indicator Track and Indicator Turnout
      icons. These icons display the status of the OBlock they
      represent by color, i.e. whether the track circuit of the OBlock
      is Occupied or Unoccupied, whether a Warrant has allocated it
      or whether a Train under Warrant currently is proceeding over
      the circuit. Details are found in the <a href=
      "../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a> Help.</p>

      <h3>Compatibility with Layout Editor</h3>
      <p>OBlocks, Portals and OPaths can be used with Layout Editor.
      Compatibility is
      achieved by using the same occupancy detection sensors for
      LayoutBlocks as for OBlocks. If there is no corresponding
      Control Panel layout diagram, Circuit Builder cannot be used.
      The Occupancy Block Tables will have to be used to define the
      OBlocks, Portals and Paths.</p>

      <h2>Creating a Warrant</h2>
      <p>In order to create a
      <b>Warrant</b> you must first have created two or more
      OBlocks. These Blocks don't have to be fully defined, but
      their existence indicates that you are interested in using
      Warrants, that is, you have a block to start a train and a
      block to stop it. When two or more OBlocks exist in PanelPro,
      Control Panel Editor will change the <b>Warrants</b> menu
      to include the following menu items:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Warrant List</b> - Opens a table of Warrants from
        which you can control warrant routes and dispatch trains.
        See <a href="WarrantTable.shtml">The Warrant
        List</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Edit Warrant...</b> - Shows the list of existing
        Warrants. Selecting one will open a Warrant Editing Window.
        The operations of this frame are discussed in <a href=
        "CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing
        Warrants</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Create New Warrant</b> - After providing system and
        user names this opens a blank Warrant Editing Window to
        create a new Warrant.<br>
        The operations of this frame are
        discussed in <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and
        Editing Warrants</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Train Trackers</b> - Opens window where the
        identity of trains can be displayed as they are moved by
        operators from one occupancy block to another.</li>

        <li><b>Create NX Warrant</b> - Opens a window to create a
        temporary eNtry/eXit (NX) Warrant. This is discussed
        in <a href="NXWarrant.shtml">About NX Warrants</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Open Session Log</b> - <span class="since">since
        3.7.3</span> Opens a window to name a file that records
        the Warrant and train tracking status messages.</li>
      </ul>

	  <h3>Warrants without Occupancy Detection</h3>
      <p>It is possible to create and run Warrants without block
	  detection.  OBlocks can be defined when they
	  do not necessarily have to have detection sensors.  Such blocks
	  are called "Dark Blocks".  Dark blocks, the portals and paths
	  within the block can be defined for a layout diagram
	  without detection sensors. A Warrant
	  can be recorded and can be played back, including
	  having its route set. However, be advised for such trains
	  without detection sensors
	  <b><i>there is no protection for having it collide with
	  other trains or throwing switches under other trains.</i></b>
	  Trains will run <b>merely</b> according to the <i>elapsed times</i>
      and <i>throttle settings</i> that were recorded.</p>

	  <h3>Warrants without Turnout Control</h3>
	  <p>It is possible to create and run Warrants without having
      turnouts thrown by JMRI. JMRI internal turnout devices will
      show the route on the layout panel, but you will need to manually
      set and verify that the route is properly set on the layout itself.
      Again, the train will proceed according to the <i>elapsed times</i>
      and <i>throttle settings</i> that were recorded.</p>
	    
      <h3>The Importance of Block Path Lengths</h3>
      <p>A Warrant detects a position of its train when it enters
      a block having occupancy detection.  All other positional
      information must be calculated. For this, the track speed of the
      train and the length of the path it is on must be known.</p>

      <p>To properly respond to a slower speed change required by a
      signal aspect, the train should prototypically slow down and
      complete the speed change before entering the block the signal
      protects.  This requires the Warrant to calculate the time and
      position for the slowdown to occur.
      </p><p>
      See <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">When Warrant Speeds Are Modified</a>
      for what track conditions require speed changes, they are detected
      and how Warrants make gradual changes of speed.
	    
      <h3>Warrant Types</h3>
      <p>There are three types of Warrants available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <b>Recorded Script Warrant</b>, where throttle commands 
        are recorded from a throttle you use to drive a train over
        preselected route. The Warrant then replicates all the
        commands when played back. To create a Recorded Script
        Warrant, select the <b>Warrants-&gt;Tables-&gt;Create New Warrant</b>
        menu item and select 'Prototypical' or 'Add Speeds' as Warrant
        type.</li>

        <li>An <b>NX Warrant</b> (eNtry/eXit), where throttle commands
        are generated automatically to move a train between Blocks
        chosen by you "on the fly". A dialog allows you to choose
        start and destination distances and to set the maximum 
        Throttle settings. To create an NX Warrant,
        select the <b>Warrants-&gt;Tables-&gt;Create NX Warrant</b>
        menu item. More on <a href="NXWarrant.shtml">NX Warrants</a></li>

        <li>A <b>Fast Reacting</b> Warrant. This type does not follow
        the usual Warrant rules, but reacts to signals
        when entering their approach block with an immediate speed
        change. The throttle settings are a fixed proportion of the
        Aspect Speed Names in Warrant Preferences. This type of warrant
        is better suited to smaller layouts. To create this type
        of Warrant, select the <b>Warrants-&gt;Tables-&gt;Create New Warrant</b>
        menu item and select 'Fast Reacting' as Warrant type.
        More on <a href="SCWarrant.shtml">Fast Reacting Warrants</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creating a Warrant</h2>
      <p>A Warrant consists of two parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <b>Route</b> over which a Train will run</li>
        <li>the <b>Commands</b> it will receive when running over the
        route.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To define the commands for a Warrant, you
      drive the train over the route you selected and the commands you
      used are recorded for playback later. For an NX Warrant, commands
      are generated automatically for the route you have selected.</p>

      <a name="CreateRoute" id="CreateRoute"></a>
      <h3>Creating the Route</h3>

      <p>A Warrant Route is a series of Block Paths linked together
      so a Train may travel over it. A
      Warrant Route is created by first choosing an <b>Origin
      block</b>, a starting Path and a Portal to exit the
      originating block. Then, a <b>Destination block</b> is chosen
      and a Path on which to end the route. Optionally, you may
      also choose a <b>Via</b> Block, that is, a Block the route
      <i>must</i> include and an <b>Avoid</b> Block, that is, a
      Block the route <i>must not</i> include. Blocks are
      inserted by typing in the block name or dragging it from a
      displayed OBlock Table. Blocks can also be selected in Control
      Panel Editor by clicking on track icons that represent these
      OBlocks. To use this feature, your Control Panel must have
      your layout depicted by Indicator Track Icons placed there
      either by Circuit Builder or manually defined by you.<br>
      Successive clicks cycle through the four block fields and
      fill in the name of the Block you clicked on.</p>

      <p>A computer algorithm determines all the intermediate
      blocks, portals and paths to make the route. If more than one
      route meets the criterion, you are presented with a list to
      review and select the route you want. Note that the Portal
      and Paths need to be chosen for the route also. If no route
      is found, a dialog is offered where you can examine the
      routes that were attempted with the current Block, Portal and
      Path selections.
      <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing
      Warrants</a> has more information about creating routes.</p>

      <h3>Scripting the Train Action</h3>
      <p>The second part of a
      Warrant are the throttle commands to control the train as it
      traverses the route. These commands are recorded
      automatically by running a train over the route in "Learn
      Mode" or are generated automatically as an "NX Warrant". The
      script commands contain the elapsed time between commands.
      Playback will duplicate this timing. However, when a Warrant
      is run with a different engine or a different consist, or
      even the same train depending whether the motor is hot or
      cold, this timing may not be replicated exactly. Because of
      this the command script is synchronized upon entering each
      detection OBlock. So, if the train is slow in reaching the
      next block, the commands for the next block will be delayed
      until the train enters the block. Conversely, if the train
      reaches the next block ahead of time, any remaining commands in
      the block just left are issued immediately so that
      the Train can <i>catch up</i> to the script.</p>

      <p>Warrant scripts are recorded or generated with a
      <i>"Clear"</i> Aspect throughout the route, even through
      blocks with restricted speeds. These speeds in the script are
      the <i>"Normal"</i> speeds. However, after creation when running,
      track conditions may not be <i>"Clear",</i> due to a signal's
      speed restriction, a block's speed restriction, occupancy by a
      rogue train or even intervention by you to halt the train.<br>
      Warrants are able to deal with these
      restrictions and will modify their <i>"Normal"</i> speeds as needed
      to comply with the restrictions. 
      <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">When Warrant Speeds Are Modified</a>
      explains this relationship.</p>

      <h4>Recording Scripts</h4>
      <p>A Warrant script is written by putting a JMRI screen
      Throttle into <i>Learn Mode</i> to record all the throttle
      commands you make when driving the train over the route. The
      script can then be replayed to drive the train automatically.
      All possible throttle functions can be recorded and played
      back. <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and 
      Editing Warrants</a> details how to do this.</p>

      <p>With LocoNet you may steal the address and manual
      LocoNet throttle. For other command systems, a WiFi
      throttle may take the same address as the screen throttle 
      and be used to record a walk around script.</p>

      <h4>Generated Scripts</h4>
      <p>For NX Warrants, the script is generated by the Warrant
      itself. It ramps the train up to a
      specified speed and ramps it down at the destination. It
      obeys all the traffic occupancy and signals as do the
      Recorded Warrants. See <a href="NXWarrant.shtml">About
      NX Warrants</a> for how to run these.</p>

      <h4>"Normal" Track Speeds</h4>
      When recording a Warrant throttle command script, the train
      should be run with all track conditions set to "Clear". 
      NX Warrant script are generated using "Clear" track conditions also.
      This is reported in status messages as the "<b>Normal</b>"
      speed.  However, when running the Warrant, the train may
      be confronted with occupation ahead by another train or
      a signal required a reduction of speed. Warrants respond
      to these and other track conditions by automatically
      modifying the scripted throttle settings.
      <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">When Warrant Speeds Are Modified</a>
      has details about how Warrants modify recorded speeds.

      <h3>Customizing the Script</h3>A Warrant script can be edited
      to modify the recorded commands. Additional non-throttle
      events can be added to the script such as triggering or
      responding to external sensors. <a href=
      "CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing Warrants</a>
      has more information about creating and customizing scripts.

      <h2>Using the Warrant List</h2>
      <p>The <b>Warrant List</b> menu
      item opens the <b>Warrant Table</b>. Each row represents a
      Warrant that was created and saved or a running NX Warrant.
      The Warrant Table reports the current status of each Warrant
      in the list and can issue commands to Halt, Resume or Abort.
      Warrant routes can be allocated, i.e. reserved for that
      Warrant, the Turnouts for route can be set and when the
      Warrant is run, its status is shown and controlled using the
      columns in the table. See <a href="WarrantTable.shtml">The
      Warrant List</a> for more information.</p>

      <h2>Tracking Trains</h2>Any train running on the layout can
      be tracked. The layout must be represented with Indicator
      Track Icons to track trains. The fourth Warrants menu item
      opens the <b>Tracker Table</b>. Pressing the <b>New
      Tracker</b> button in this window opens a dialog to enter a
      train name and the OBlock it occupies. Pressing the done
      button creates a row in the Tracking Table. The row shows the
      train name and the block it currently occupies and the length
      of time it has occupied the block. As the train moves from
      block to block, this status is updated. The Indicator Track
      Icons can display the train name.

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <b>Note:</b> The <b>Edit Icon</b> popup menu item opens a
        dialog for Indicator Track Icons containing a <b>Display Train
        Name when occupied</b> checkbox to select to display text
        for train tracking or Warrant running.
      </div>

      <p>The window also has a <b>Refresh Tracker Info</b>
      button to poll the trackers listed in the Tracker table and an
      <b>OBlock Pick List</b> button to display a picklist.</p>

      <p>The location of the train can be set by typing, by
      dragging block name from the picklist, or by clicking on an
      Indicator Track Icon in the panel.</p>

      <p>Tracking can also be done for a train by dragging and
      dropping a Loco Icon onto the OBlock the train occupies. This
      is the most simple way of tracking in that both the name and
      location are done with a single drag and drop.</p>

      <h2>Using Warrants in Logix</h2>
      <p>Several of the operations that can be done from the Warrant
      List and Warrant Editing frame can be done with Logix
      Conditionals. You may design and implement a dispatcher's
      panel using the Warrant state variables and actions found
      in Logix.</p>

      <h3>Warrant State Variables</h3>
      <p>When a Warrant has been
      allocated or is in effect, the following state variables can
      be tested in a Logix conditional.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Route Free</b>: - True when all Blocks in the
        Warrant route are not allocated to anyone and are not
        occupied. False otherwise.</li>

        <li><b>Route Set</b>: - True when all blocks in the Warrant
        route are allocated and the turnouts set for this Warrant.
        False otherwise.</li>

        <li><b>Route Allocated</b>: - True when all blocks in the
        Warrant route are allocated to this Warrant. False
        otherwise.</li>

        <li><b>Route Occupied</b>: - True when none of the blocks
        in the Warrant route, other than the origin block, are
        occupied. (Assumes the train of this Warrant is occupying
        the origin block). False otherwise.</li>

        <li><b>Train Running</b>: - True when the train specified
        in the Warrant is running either in Learn Mode or Auto Run
        Mode. False otherwise.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Warrant Actions</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Allocate Warrant Route</b>: - Allocates the route to
        this Warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Deallocate Warrant</b>: - Deallocates the route of
        this Warrant (only). This will not deallocate the route of
        a different Warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Set Route Turnouts</b>: - Sets the signals and
        turnouts for the route as far along the route that it can
        until it reaches an occupied block or a block allocated to
        another Warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Auto Run Train</b>: - Issue the throttle commands to
        the train in the Warrant. This should only be done when the
        train occupies the Origin block.</li>

        <li><b>Set Train Id</b>: - Set the engine consist to be
        used in the Warrant from a trainId in the Engine Roster.
        Alternatively, the DCC address can be used to identify the
        engine.</li>

        <li><b>Set Train Name</b>: - Set the name of the train to
        display in the loco marker indicating the current position
        of the train when running.</li>

        <li><b>Control Train</b>: - Send a control command
        (<b>Halt</b>, <b>Resume</b> or <b>Abort)</b> to a running
        train under warrant.</li>
      </ul>
