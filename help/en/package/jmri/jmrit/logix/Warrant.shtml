      <h1>Warrants</h1>A Warrant is a collection of information
      sufficient to run an automated train. It will set the
      turnouts for a specified route and drive the train over the
      route. When running, using block occupancy detection and
      signal configuration, it will make a best effort to control
      speed according to signal aspects and occupancy and other
      track conditions ahead. A JMRI Warrant is suggestive of what
      a warrant does on a prototype railroad, but there is no
      intention to replicate any particular railroad's mode of
      operation. It is simply the idea of giving an automated train
      trackage rights to move from point A to point B.

      <p><b>Warrants</b> depend on having an accurate description
      of the layout in terms of <b>OBlocks</b>, <b>Portals</b> and
      <b>OPaths</b>. These elements are created by entering data
      into the <b>Occupancy Block Tables</b> or by using the
      graphical interface of the <b>Circuit Builder</b>. Initially
      neither of these subsystems are visible in Control Panel
      editor.</p>

      <p>It is important that the scale of your layout is known so
      that the warrant can compute the distances required when
      encountering signals. Go the <b>Warrants</b> panel of
      <b>Preferences</b> to set the layout scale. There are other
      parameters related to warrants there, that you may wish to
      change later, but the defaults are generally sufficient
      without change. See <a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Warrants">Warrant
      Preferences</a> for information about configuration.</p>

      <h2>How To Get Started</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Definitions of OBlocks, Portals and OPaths are found at
        <a href="OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block
        Tables</a>.</li>

        <li>Opening the Occupancy Block Tables is done by either
        the <b>Tools-&gt;Tables-&gt;Occupancy Blocks</b> menu item
        from the menus in the main PanelPro window, or by
        the <b>Add Items-&gt;Occupancy Blocks</b> menu item 
        from the menus of Control Panel Editor. How to create
        OBlock, Portals and OPaths is described in <a href=
        "OBlockEdit.shtml">Creating and Editing OBlocks, Portals
        and OPaths</a>.</li>

        <li>OBlocks, Portals and Paths can be created using the
        <b>Circuit Builder</b> tool found in the Control Panel
        Editor. Initially, the Circuit Builder can be opened using
        the <b>Open Circuit Builder</b> menu item under the
        <b>Warrants</b> menu. Instructions for use are found in
        <a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">The Circuit
        Builder</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is Circuit Builder</h3>Circuit Builder is an
      interactive tool that creates OBlocks, Portals and Paths
      graphically. It is necessary to have a track diagram of your
      layout expressed with track icons (track segments and turnout
      icons) in a Control Panel Editor panel. OBlocks are created  
      by clicking on the track icons. The
      Circuit Builder can convert the track segments and turnout
      icons of your layout into Indicator Track and Indicator Turnout
      icons. These icons display the status of the OBlock they
      represent by color, i.e. whether the track circuit of the OBlock
      is occupied or unoccupied, whether a warrant has allocated it
      or whether a train under warrant currently is proceeding over
      the circuit. Details are found at <a href=
      "../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">The Circuit Builder</a>,

      <h3>Compatibility With Layout Editor</h3>OBlocks, Portals and
      Paths can be used with Layout Editor. Compatibility is
      achieved by using the same occupancy detection sensors for
      LayoutBlocks as for OBlocks. If there is no corresponding
      Control Panel layout diagram, Circuit Builder cannot be used.
      The Occupancy Block Tables will have to be used to define the
      OBlocks, Portals and Paths.

      <h3>More About Getting Started</h3>In order to create a
      <b>Warrant</b> you must first have created two or more
      OBlocks. These blocks don't have to be fully defined, but
      their existence indicates that you are interested in using
      Warrants, that is, you have a block to start a train and a
      block to stop it. When two or more OBlocks exist Control
      Panel Editor will change the items under the <b>Warrants</b>
      menu to be the following menu items. The Warrant menu items
      are:

      <ul>
        <li><b>Warrant List</b>: - Opens a table of warrants from
        which you can control warrant routes and dispatch trains.
        See <a href="WarrantTable.shtml">The Warrants
        List</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Edit Warrant...</b>: - Shows the list of existing
        warrants. Selecting one will open a Warrant Editing Window.
        The operations of this frame are discussed in <a href=
        "CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing
        Warrants</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Create New Warrant</b>: - After providing system and
        user names this opens a blank Warrant Editing Window to
        create a new warrant. The operations of this frame are
        discussed in <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and
        Editing Warrants</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Train Trackers</b>: - Opens window where the
        identity of trains can be displayed as they move from one
        occupancy block to another.</li>

        <li><b>Create NXWarrant</b> - Opens a window to create an
        eNtry/eXit warrant. this is discussed in <a href=
        "NXWarrant.shtml">About NXWarrants</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Open Session Log</b> - Opens a window to name a file
        that records the warrant and train tracking status
        messages.</li>
      </ul>The editor also will display a <b>Circuit Builder</b>
      menu. Otherwise, this menu is not displayed. The circuit
      Builder menu contains menu items to create and edit OBlocks,
      Portals and OPaths and to position icons that represent them.

	  <h3>Warrants without Occupancy Detection</h3>
	    It is possible to create and run warrants without block 
	    detection.  OBlocks can be defined and they 
	    do not necessarily have to have detection sensors.  Such blocks
	    are called "Dark Blocks".  Dark blocks, Portals and the paths
	    within the block can be defined for a layout diagram.  A Warrant
	    can be recorded and be able to be played back, including 
	    having its route set.  However, be advised for such trains
	    <b><i>there is no protection for having it collide with 
	    other trains or throwing switches under other trains.</i></b>
	    It will proceed <b>only</b> according to the <i>elapsed times</i>
	    and <i>throttle settings</i> that were recorded.
	    
	    <h3>The Importance of Block Path Lengths</h3>
	    A Warrant detects a position of its train when it enters
	    a block having occupancy detection.  All other positional 
	    information must be calculated. For this, the speed of the
	    train and the length of the path it is on must be known.
	    Please see <a href="#RampParams">Parameters Needed for Ramping</a>
	    below if you intend to use NXWarrants and employ gradual changes 
	    of speed.
	        
      <h2>Creating a Warrant</h2>There are three types of warrants;
      <ul>
        <li>A recorded script Warrant, where throttle commands are
        recorded from a throttle you use to drive a train over
        preselected route. The warrant then replicates all the
        commands when played back. To create a recorded script
        warrant, select the menu item <b>Create New Warrant</b>
        from the <b>Warrants</b> menu.</li>

        <li>An <a href="NXWarrant.shtml">NXwarrant</a>, that is, an
        eNtry/eXit warrant. These warrants are created by selecting
        a start position and an end position and having the warrant
        generate the commands to drive the train from start to end.
        To create an NXwarrant select the menu item <b>Create
        NXWarrant</b> from the <b>Warrants</b> menu.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In either case, first a route must be chosen on which to
      run the train. The <b>Creating Routes</b> section below
      describes how this is done.</p>

      <h2>Elements of a Warrant</h2>A warrant consists of two
      parts; The route over which a train will run and the commands
      it will receive when running over the route. For a Warrant, you
      drive the train over the route you selected and the commands you
      used are recorded for playback later. For an NXWarrant, commands
      are generated automatically for the route you have selected.

      <h3>Creating Routes</h3>A warrant route is a series of block
      paths linked together so a train may travel over it. A
      warrant route is created by first choosing an <b>origin
      block</b>, a starting path and a portal to exit the
      originating block. Then, a <b>destination block</b> is chosen
      and a path on which to end the route. Optionally, you may
      also chose a <b>Via</b> block, that is, a block that route
      <i>must</i> include and a <b>Avoid</b> block, that is, a
      block the the route <i>must not</i> include. Blocks are
      chosen by typing in the block name or dragging it from a
      displayed OBlock table. Blocks can also be chosen by clicking
      on track icons that represent these OBlocks. To use this
      feature your panel must have your layout depicted by
      Indicator Track Icons placed there by Circuit builder or
      by you manually.
      Successive clicks cycle the choices through the four block
      fields.

      <p>A computer algorithm determines all the intermediate
      blocks, portals and paths to make the route. If more than one
      route meets the criterion, you are presented with a list to
      review and select the route you want. Note that the Portal
      and Paths need to be chosen for the route also. If no route
      is found, a dialog is offered where you can examine the
      routes that were attempted with the current Block, Portal and
      Path selections.
      <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing
      Warrants</a> has more information about creating routes.</p>

      <h3>Scripting the Train Action</h3>The second part of a
      Warrant are the throttle commands to control the train as it
      traverses the route. These commands are recorded
      automatically by running a train over the route in "Learn
      Mode" or are generated automatically as an "NXWarrant". The
      script commands contain the elapsed time between commands.
      Playback will duplicate this timing. However when a warrant
      is run with a different engine or a different consist, or
      even the same train depending whether the motor is hot or
      cold, this timing may not be replicated exactly. Because of
      this the command script is synchronized upon entering each
      detection OBlock. So, if the train is slow in reaching the
      next block, the commands for the next block will be delayed
      until the train enters the block. Conversely, if the train
      reaches the next block ahead of time, any remaining commands in
      the block just left will issued with no elapsed time so that
      the train can <i>catch up</i> to the script.

      <p>Warrant scripts are recorded or generated with a
      <i>"Clear"</i>, aspect throughout the route even through
      blocks with restricted speeds. These speeds in the script are
      the <i>"Normal"</i> speeds. However, after creation when running, track
      conditions may not be <i>"Clear",</i> due to a signal's speed
      restriction, a block's speed restriction, occupancy by a
      rouge train or even intevention by you to halt the train. 
      Warrants are able to deal with these
      restrictions and will modify their <i>Normal"</i> speeds as needed
      to comply with the restrictions. The section <a href=
      "#SpeedMap">"Warrants and Speed Restrictions"</a> below
      explains this relationship.</p>

      <h4>Recording Scripts</h4>This is done by putting a screen
      throttle into <i>Learn Mode</i> that records all the throttle
      commands you make when driving the train over the route. This
      script can then be replayed to drive the train automatically.
      All possible throttle functions can be recorded and played
      back.

      <p>With LocoNet you may steal the address and manual
      LocoNet throttle. For other command systems, a WiFi
      throttle may take the same address as the screen throttle 
      and be used to record a walk around script.</p>

      <h4>Generated Scripts</h4>For NXWarrants the script is
      generated by the warrant itself. It ramps the train up to a
      specified speed and ramps it down at the destination. It
      obeys all the traffic occupancy and signals as do the
      recorded warrants. See <a href="NXWarrant.shtml">About
      NXWarrants</a> for how to run them.

      <h3>Customizing the Script</h3>A warrant script can be edited
      to modify the recorded commands. Additional non-throttle
      events can be added to the script such as triggering or
      responding to external sensors. <a href=
      "CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing Warrants</a>.
      has more information about creating and customizing scripts.

      <a name="SpeedMap" id="SpeedMap"></a>
      <h2>Warrants and Speed Restrictions</h2>A train running under
      a warrant must be aware of track conditions ahead. Signals
      may indicate reduced speed or permission to return to normal
      speed. Blocks may impose yard limit speed restrictions. Rogue
      trains may show up unexpectedly in the route. In our
      imagination, we can presume
      their detection means our warrant "engineer" sees a fusse. For
      each of these cases the warrant must look ahead, detect the
      need for a speed change and schedule the right time to do it
      - all the while making the change smoothly and completing it
      in prototypical fashion.
      
      <h3>Configuring Speed Restrictions</h3>
      For a warrant to detect a <b>signaled speed change</b> the signal 
      must be configured in the Occupancy Block Tables. 
      The Signal Table there configures the entrance Portal to the
      OBlock that the signal protects.  The warrant then uses the 
      signal system configured for the signal to detect the aspect
      speed.
      <p>Likewise, <b>block speeds</b> are configured in the Occupancy 
      Block Tables.  A column in the OBlock Table allows you to
      choose an aspect speed that the warrant will enforce.</p>
      
      <p>When a <b>occupancy</b> sensor is activated ahead of the train
      on its route, the warrant will take note of it and
      make any necessary speed change.</p>
      <p>Finally, <b>you</b> can instruct the warrant to ramp down to a stop
      or issue an emergency stop.  Also, you can ramp up from a stop 
      and resume the former speed.</p>
      
	  <p>When a warrant ramps down a speed change due to a signal, block
      or rouge occupancy condition, That speed change remains in
      effect until the condition is removed. At that time the
      speed is ramped up to the previous "normal" speed.  The
      precedence order is: rouge occupancy, signal aspect, block speed.</p>
            
      <h3>A Note About Ramps</h3>When JMRI needs to intervene and
      enforce a speed change that was not recorded, several calculations
      must be made. Two pieces of information are vital.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Distance</b> from the train to the situation requiring  
        the speed change.  For this the lengths of the paths of the 
        route must be known. </li>
        <li><b>Speed</b> of the train.  For this a 
        correlation of the throttle settings to the actual speed
        of the train on the layout must be known.</li> 
      </ul>
      There are several options in providing this information and there
      are default values for all of the parameters.  You may want
      to experiment with warrants using these default settings
      and defer reading the following sections until later.

      <a name="RampParams" id="RampParams"></a>
      <h2>Parameters Needed for Ramping</h2>To compute how far to
      look ahead and the time when to modify speed the following
      must be known.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Block Lengths</b> are needed for distances.  There
          is a length column in the OBlock Table.  There is also
          a column to open its path tables. Each path table has
          a length column as well.  Likewise the OBlock and OPath
          windows in Circuit Builder have text fields to enter 
          lengths. Inches or centimeters may be used.
          <p>When no block length is specified a rather
          large value is assumed.  It is <b><i>highly recommended
          </i></b> that block lengths be specified. <i>Your
          wild guess is better than the default.</i>  If the 
          paths within a block vary widely, path lengths
          should be set. Otherwise, path
          lengths are inherited from the block length.
        </li>
        <li><b>Layout Scale</b> is needed for distances when speed is
        expressed as Mph or Km/h.  This is set from a drop down box at
        the <b>Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</b> menu of the main 
        PanelPro window</li>
        <li>
          <b>Track Speed</b> is more difficult to obtain reproducibly.
          <ul>
            <li>
            A first approximation is the <b>"Throttle Setting/Speed Factor"</b>
            value at Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants.
            <p>When used this factor is a linear multiplier to relate throttle
            setting to track speed.  Note this is a global value so 
            all of the locomotives
            in your fleet may not operate optimally with the same factor.
            However, it could be satisfactory for your tastes.</li>
            <li> 
            For more precision a <b>Speed Profile</b> can be made for each
            locomotive.  While somewhat laborious to do, it does provide
            values to make more accurate calculations. The Speed Profiler
            is found at <b>Roster-&gt;Speed Profiling</b>.</li>  
          </ul>
          In spite of precise calculations, there are parameters
          such as train length, the friction of individual cars, track
          cleanliness, motor performance (and on and on) that influence
          actual track speed.  
          A rough approximation of speed factors may be sufficient for 
          your satisfaction.
         </li>  
      </ul>  
        
         The smoothness for slow down and
      speed up are done by stepping up and down with two "ramp"
      parameters; the throttle increment per step and the time
        interval of each step.  These two parameters are paired to
        make a "stair step" pattern for changing speed.  
        Generally, they are paired in that a small throttle increment
        should be done in a short time interval and a large increment
        in a longer time. When setting them, the time interval should
        be long enough for the speed increment to complete given the 
        momentum you have programmed into your decoders.
        They are set in <b>&gt;Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</b>.
	  <ul>
        <li><b>Ramp Step throttle Increment</b>  This value is
        a ratio of full throttle. Seven or eight speed steps of a
        128 step throttle is an appropriate increment for a
        locomotive with modest momentum. A value of 0.03 to 0.06 is
        recommended.</li>

        <li><b>Ramp Step time</b> Depending how you have
        configured momentum on your
        locomotives, adjust this value so the speed change is 
        completed within this period of time. Typically 
        300 to 1000 milliseconds would be appropriate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Getting Speed Profiles for Your Trains</h3>Converting a
      throttle setting to achieve a given track speed is dependent
      on the engine and its decoder. The decoder's speed
      curve to deliver voltage to the motor, and the motor's rpm
      response under load with that voltage is rarely linear. 
      Likewise, whether the
      motor is driving the train forward or reverse often results
      in different track speeds.

      <p>A Speed Profile can be made for an engine that will
      provide the necessary factors to set throttle settings that
      will result in more accurate track speeds. These profiles are
      maintained in the Roster and there is a tool that will create
      them at <b>Roster-&gt;Speed Profiling</b>. Alternatively, Speed
      Profile factors for a selected set of throttle settings for
      the motive power used in a warrant can be determined by using
      the NXWarrant <b>Compute Throttle Factor</b> checkbox.</p>

      <p>NXWarrants have a feature whereby running the train over a
      block of known length will compute a speed profile throttle
      factor for the train. Frequently, calibrating a slow, medium
      and fast throttle setting for both forward and reverse will
      be sufficient. See <a href="NXWarrant.shtml#Calibrate">About
      NXWarrants</a>.</p>

      <h2>Aspect Speed Map and its Interpretation</h2>Speeds are
      named in the aspects.xml files that signal masts use in the
      Signal Mast System. These speed names are also used in the
      Blocks tables. To control train speed, values must be
      assigned to these speed names. The Aspect Speed Map found at
      <i>&gt;Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</i> provides a value
      for each named speed. It is up to the user to assign a value
      to the name and a meaning to the value. On the preferences
      warrant panel there are four radio buttons to assign meaning
      to the values entered into the Speed Map Table.

      <p>In defining the four choices, to help explain them we'll
      use a few examples and compare them as the warrants approach
      a signal whose entrance speed name is "Medium". In the
      examples, the throttle setting for "Normal" is the recorded
      throttle setting when approaching the signal.<br>
      <b>Warrant#1</b> is recorded with Engine A and it achieves a
      scale speed of 60 mph (or 96 kmph) at a throttle setting of
      0.8 (102 speed steps). This was the "Normal" speed recorded
      by the warrant approaching the signal.<br>
      We will also assume engines B and C use Warrant#1. Engine B
      only reaches a scale speed 50 mph at an 0.8 throttle setting
      and Engine C attains a scale speed 70 mph at an 0.8 throttle
      setting is also used in the warrant.<br>
      <b>Warrant#2</b> is recorded with engine C and the "Normal"
      throttle setting approaching the signal was 0.68 which would
      be about 60 mph.<br>
      <b>Warrant#3</b> is a slow freight recorded with engine C and
      the "Normal" throttle setting approaching the signal was
      0.36, which would be about 31.5 mph.</p>

      <p>We have the situation where the warrants are looking ahead
      to a signal showing an aspect of "Medium" speed. The
      prototype railroad using this signal defines medium speed as
      30 mph. We will also assume we have set the Aspect speed name
      value to be the best guess we can make to duplicate
      prototypical speed at layout scale.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Percent of Normal</b> - The value is a percentage of
          the recorded ("Normal") speed. Speed names are
          restrictive, therefore this value should be less than
          100.

          <p>Best guess for the table value of "Medium" is 50.<br>
          Warrant#1 will reduce the setting to 0.40 and this could
          be a perfect scale 30 mph for Engine A and Engine B is
          likely to reduce speed to 25 mph, but engine C will
          likely pass the signal at 35 mph.<br>
          Warrant#2 will reduce the setting to 0.34 and this could
          be a perfect scale 30 mph for Engine C. Engine A is
          likely to pass the signal at 25.5 mph and Engine B at
          about 21 mph.<br>
          Warrant#3 will reduce the setting to 0.18 and this is
          likely to give Engine C a speed of 16 mph passing the
          signal. The speeds of Engines A and B will be even
          slower.<br>
          In all case the recorded speed is reduced by half. That
          is, <i>speed is always changed</i></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Percent of Full Throttle</b> - The value is an
          absolute throttle setting expressed as a percentage of
          full throttle, i.e. a number between 0 and 100.

          <p>A best guess for the table value for "Medium" is
          40.<br>
          Warrant#1 will make the setting 0.40 and so Engine A most
          likely will pass the signal at 30 mph. Engine B is likely
          to reduce speed to 25 mph, but engine C will likely pass
          the signal at 35 mph.<br>
          Warrant#2 will make the setting 0.40 and so Engines A, B
          and C will pass the signal at the same speeds as
          above.<br>
          Warrant#3 will not change the setting since it is already
          less than 0.40 so Engine C's speed will be unchanged at
          31.5 mph. Engine A most likely will pass the signal at 27
          mph and Engine B at 22.5 mph.<br>
          This interpretation <i>puts an upper limit on the
          throttle setting</i>, but not the scale track speed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Miles per hour</b> - The value is the scale miles per
          hour.<br>
          The table value for "Medium" should be 30.

          <p>For Warrant#1 and Warrant#2, using each engine's
          throttle factor Engines A. B, and C all will likely pass
          the signal at 30 mph.<br>
          Warrant#3 will modify Engine C's speed to 30 mph. It will
          not modify the speeds of Engines A and B. Engine A most
          likely will pass the signal at 27 mph and Engine B at
          22.5 mph.<br>
          Given that a sufficient Speed Profile has been made,
          <i>Prototypical signal speeds can be done without speed
          matching.</i></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Kilometers per Hour</b> - The value is the scale
          kilometers per hour.<br>
          The table value for "Medium" should be 48.

          <p>The results are the same as the Mph case. This is
          simply using the metric system units.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>To sum up; if you are not fussy about being prototypical
      and always want to see speed change when signals are passed,
      use "Percent of Normal". If you have calibrated a sufficient
      Speed Profile for each of your engines you can use either of
      the last two speed interpretations which express throttle
      setting in terms of scale track speed.

      <h3>The Signal Head Appearance Table</h3>If signal heads are
      used on the layout, their appearances can be mapped to the
      speed names of signal masts in this table on the warrant
      preferences panel.

      <p>One use of this is to use virtual signal heads to
      dynamically influence the behavior of warrants. The
      appearance of these signals can be set either by panel icons
      or Logix. Since there are 8 possible signal head appearances
      additional speed names can be created so a unique speed can
      be made for each appearance.</p>

      <h3>Editing the Speed Map Table</h3>Rows can be added or
      deleted. The default speed map has the names "Fifty" and
      "Sixty". These names only appear in signal mast systems for
      UP-2008 and BNSF-1996, so they can safely be deleted if you
      do use these signal systems. You only need but <i>must
      have</i> all the speed names that appear in the signal system
      you have configured for your layout.

      <p>If you add a new speed name for a signal head appearance,
      then add a row for that name in the Signal Map Table.</p>

      <h2>Block speed Names</h2>A speed name can be set for each
      block by selecting a name from the <b>Speed Notch</b> column
      of the OBlock Table. One use of this feature could be to
      enforce a yard limit speed. Unlike signal speed names, block
      speed names are bi-directional. To return a warrant's speed
      to normal when leaving a yard limit, the speed names of the
      OBlocks on either side of the yard block should set to
      "Normal". Use care when combining this feature with signals
      to avoid providing conflicting speed change messages.

      <p>To unset an OBlock speed name choose the blank setting
      from the <b>Speed Limit</b> column. As with the absence of a
      signal, when there is no speed name the warrant continues at
      its current speed.</p>

      <h2>Using the Warrant List</h2>The <b>Warrant List</b> menu
      item opens the <b>Warrant Table</b>. Each row is a warrant
      that has been created and saved or is a running NXWarrant.
      The Warrant Table reports the current status of each warrant
      in the list and can issue commands to Halt, Resume or Abort.
      Warrant routes can be allocated, i.e. reserved for that
      warrant, the turnouts for route can be set and when the
      warrant is run, its status is shown and controlled using the
      columns in the table. See <a href="WarrantTable.shtml">The
      Warrant List</a> for information about the table.

      <h2>Tracking Trains</h2>Any train running on the layout can
      be tracked. The layout must be represented with Indicator
      Track Icons to track trains. The fourth Warrants menu item
      opens the <b>Tracker Table</b>. Pressing the <b>New
      Tracker</b> button in this window opens a dialog to enter a
      train name and the OBlock it occupies. Pressing the done
      button creates a row in the Tracking Table. The row shows the
      train name and the block it currently occupies and the length
      of time it has occupied the block. As the train moves from
      block to block, this status is updated. The Indicator Track
      Icons can display the train name.

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <b>Note:</b> The <b>Edit Icon</b> popup menu item opens a
        dialog for Indicator Track Icons have a <b>Display Train
        Name when occupied</b> checkbox to select to display text
        for train tracking or warrant running.
      </div>The window also has a <b>Refresh Tracker Info</b>
      button to poll the trackers listed in the Tracker table and a
      <b>OBlock Pick List</b> button to display a picklist.

      <p>The location of the train can be set by typing, by
      dragging block name from the picklist, or by clicking on a
      Indicator Track Icon in the panel.</p>

      <p>Tracking can also be done for a train by dragging and
      dropping a Loco Icon onto the OBlock the train occupies. This
      is the most simple way of tracking in that both the names and
      location are done with a single drag and drop.</p>

      <h2>Using Warrants in Logix</h2>Several of the operations
      that can be done from the Warrant List and Warrant Editing
      frame can be done with Logix Conditionals. You may design and
      implement a dispatcher's panel using the Warrant state
      variables and actions found in Logix.

      <h3>Warrant State Variables</h3>When a warrant has been
      allocated or is in effect, the following state variables can
      be tested in a Logix conditional.

      <ul>
        <li><b>Route Free</b>: - True when all blocks in the
        warrant route are not allocated to anyone and are not
        occupied. False otherwise.</li>

        <li><b>Route Set</b>: - True when all blocks in the warrant
        route are allocated and the turnouts set for this warrant.
        False otherwise.</li>

        <li><b>Route Allocated</b>: - True when all blocks in the
        warrant route are allocated to this warrant. False
        otherwise.</li>

        <li><b>Route Occupied</b>: - True when none of the blocks
        in the warrant route, other than the origin block, are
        occupied. (Assumes the train of this warrant is occupying
        the origin block). False otherwise.</li>

        <li><b>Train Running</b>: - True when the train specified
        in the warrant is running either in Learn Mode or Auto Run
        Mode. False otherwise.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Warrant Actions</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Allocate Warrant Route</b>: - Allocates the route to
        this warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Deallocate Warrant</b>: - Deallocates the route of
        this warrant (only). This will not deallocate the route of
        a different warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Set Route Turnouts</b>: - Sets the signals and
        turnouts for the route as far along the route that it can
        until it reaches an occupied block or a block allocated to
        another warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Auto Run Train</b>: - Issue the throttle commands to
        the train in the warrant. This should only be done when the
        train occupies the Origin block.</li>

        <li><b>Set Train Id</b>: - Set the engine consist to be
        used in the warrant from a trainId in the Engine Roster.
        Alternatively, the DCC address can be used to identify the
        engine.</li>

        <li><b>Set Train Name</b>: - Set the name of the train to
        display in the loco marker indicating the current position
        of the train when running.</li>

        <li><b>Control Train</b>: - Send a control command
        (<b>Halt</b>, <b>Resume</b> or <b>Abort)</b> to a running
        train under warrant.</li>
