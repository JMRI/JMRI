<H1>Warrants</H1>

A Warrant is a collection of information sufficient to run an automated train.
It will set the turnouts for a specified route and drive the train over the route.  
When running, using block occupancy detection and signal configuration, it will 
make a best effort to control speed according to signal aspects and  
occupancy conditions ahead.
A JMRI Warrant is suggestive of what a warrant does on a prototype railroad, but
there is no intention to replicate any particular railroad's mode of
operation.  It is simply the idea of giving an automated train trackage rights to 
move from point A to point B.
<p>
<b>Warrants</b> depend on having an accurate description of the layout in terms of
<b>OBlocks</b>, <b>Portals</b> and <b>OPaths</b>.  These elememts are
created using the <b>Occupancy Block Tables</b>.  They are a menu item under 
the <b>Tools</b> menu in the PanelPro window under the <b>Add Items</b> menu of Control 
Panel Editor.  Also they may be created using the menu items under the <b>Circuit Builder</b>
menu of Control Panel Editor.  Their definitions listed found at
<a href="OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block Tables</a>.  There, it is explained
how to create them by filling out table entries. 
<p>
Alternatively,
<b>OBlocks</b>, <b>Portals</b> and <b>OPaths</b> can be created using
the <b>Circuit Builder</b> tool found in the Control Panel Editor.  Circuit Builder
is an interactive tool that creates OBlocks, Portals and Paths graphically.  The Circuit 
Builder will also convert the track segments and turnout icons of your layout to 
Indicator Track and Indicator Turnout icons.  These icons display the
status of the OBlock they represent by color - whether the track circuit of the OBlock is
occupied or unoccupied, whether a warrant has allocated it or whether a train 
under warrant currently is proceeding over the circuit.  The <b>Circuit Builder</b>
is accessed under the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu of the Control Panel Editor.
Instructions for use are found in 
 <a href="..\display\CircuitBuilder.shtml">The Circuit Builder</a>.
</p> 

<H2>Creating a Warrant</H2>
There are two types of warrants; 
		<li>a recorded script Warrant, where 
throttle commands are recorded from a throttle you use to drive a train over
preselected route.  The warrant then replicates all the commands when played back.</li>
	and
		<li>an NXwarrant, that is, an eNtry/eXit warrant. These warrants are created by
selecting a start position and an end position and having Control Panel Editor
generate the commands to drive the train from start to end.</li>
<p>		

In order to create a <b>Warrant</b> you must first have created two or more OBlocks.
These blocks don't have to be fully defined, but their existence indicates that you 
are interested in using Warrants.
When two or more OBlocks exist    
Control Panel Editor will display a <b>Warrants</b> menu with the following
menu items.  The Warrant menu items are:
<ul>
        <li><b>Warrant List</b>: - Opens a table of warrants from which you
        	can control warrant routes and dispatch trains.</li>
        <li><b>Edit Warrant...</b>: - Shows the list of existing  warrants.
        	Selecting one will open a Warrant Editing Window.  The
        	operations of this frame are discussed in <A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml">
        	Creating and Editing Warrants</A>.</li>  
        <li><b>Create New Warrant</b>: - After providing system and user names this
		opens a blank Warrant Editing Window to create a new warrant. The
        	operations of this frame are discussed in <A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml">
        	Creating and Editing Warrants</A>.</li>
	  <li><b>Train Trackers</b>: - Opens window where the identity of trains can be
		displayed as they move from one occupancy block to another.</li>
	  <li><b>Create NXWarrant</b> - Opens a window to create an eNtry/eXit warrant.</li>
	  <li><b>Open Session Log</b> - Opens a window to name a file that records the
	  warrant and train tracking status messages.</li>
</ul>

The editor also will display a <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu.   Otherwise, this menu is not displayed.
The circuit Builder menu contains menu items to create and edit OBlocks, Portals and OPaths
and to position icons that represent them.
<p>
<H2>Elements of a Warrant</H2>
A warrant consists of two parts; The route over which a train will run and the commands
it will receive when running over the route.

<H3>Creating Routes</H3>
A warrant route is a series of block paths linked together so a train
may travel over it.  A warrant route is created by first choosing an <b>origin
block</b>, a starting path and a portal to exit the orginating block.  Then,
<b>destination block</b> is chosen and a path on which to end the route.  Blocks
are chosen either by typing in the block name or dragging it from a displayed 
OBlock table.  The origin and destination blocks can also be chosen by clicking on track
icons that represent these OBlocks.  To use this feature your panel must have your layout
depicted by Indicator Track Icons placed there by Circuit builder. A computer algorithm
determines all the intermediate blocks and paths to make the route.  You have options to
include or avoid specified blocks in the route.
<A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml"> Creating and Editing Warrants</A>. has more
information about creating routes.</p>

<H3>Scripting the Train Action</H3>
The second part of a Warrant are the throttle commands to control the train as it traverses the
route.  This is done by putting a screen throttle into <i>Learn Mode</i> that records all the 
throttle comands you make when driving the train over the route.  This script can then
be replayed to drive the train automatically. All possible throttle functions can be recorded
and played back.
<p>
For NXWarrants the script is generated by Control Panel Editor.  It ramps the train up to speed
and ramps it down at the destination.  It obeys all the traffic occupancy and signals as do the
recorded warrants

<H3>Customizing the Script</H3>
The script can be edited to modify the recoreded commands.  Additional non-throttle events
can be added to the script such as triggering or responding to external sensors.
<A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml"> Creating and Editing Warrants</A>. has more
information about creating and customizing scripts.</p>
<p>
<H2>Using the Warrant List</H2>
The <b>Warrant List</b> menu item opens the <b>Warrant Table</b>.  Each row is a
warrant that has been created and saved.  Warrant routes can be allocated, i.e. reserved
for that warrant, the turnouts for route can be set and when the warrant is run, its status
is shown and controlled using the columns in the table.

<H3>Columns in the Warrant Table</H3>
<ul>
        <li><b>Warrant</b>: - The name of the warrant.</li> 
        <li><b>Route</b>: - The route of the warrant is listed in a drop down combo box by 
		clicking the table cell</li>
        <li><b>Train Name</b>: - The Train Id, as stated in the Roster.  This cell can be
		edited and its content is displayed by the Indicator Track Icons when the train
		occupies their OBlock. (The edit popup of Indicator Track Icons have a checkbox 
		to enable this function)</li>
        <li><b>DCC Address</b>: - The DCC Address of the locomotive or consist.  This cell can
		be edited to correspond to the current motive power of the train.</li>
        <li><b>Allocate</b>: - A button that reserves the route for the warrant.  The Indicator
		Track Icons display green to indicate the route.</li>
        <li><b>Deallocate</b>: - A button that removes the reservation for the warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Set</b>: - A button that allocates and sets the turnouts for the warrant route.</li>
        <li><b>AutoRun</b>: - A button that runs the train over the route according to the 
		throttle commands of the warrant. The recorded speed of the train will be modified 
		according to the occupancy and signal aspects encountered on the route.  The 
		Indicator Track Icons display the current position of the
		of the train with a blue color.</li>
        <li><b>ManRun</b>: - A button that allocates the warrant and sets the route for
        a manual operator to run the train.  The script is not run.  The 
		Indicator Track Icons display the current position of the
		of the train with a blue color.</li>
        <li><b>Control/Status</b>: - The status of the warrant is shown.  It also has a 
		drop down combo box that can send the following commands to a running train. 
		<b><i>Note</b>: This column has two functions - 
		Status messages and control buttons.</i>
        <ul>
        	<li><b>Halt</b> - Temporarily halts the train and suspends execution of the 
			throttle command script</li>
		<li><b>Resume</b> - Ramps up the speed of the train to its former setting and 
			restarts the throttle command script
		<li><b>Retry</b> - Repeats the test for whether a signal aspect has changed or
			an occupied block ahead has cleared.  (Ocaisionally a sensor change can be
			missed due to a short or other hardware malfunction.  This retest may allow 
			a stopped train to continue.)
		<li><b>Abort</b> - Abort the script and deallocate the warrant.</li>
	  </ul>
        <li><b>Edit</b>: - A button that opens an editing window for the warrant,</li>
        <li><b>Delete</b>: - A button that deletes the warrant.</li>
</ul></p>

<H3>Creating NX Warrants</H3>
Warrants from an eNtry block to an eXit block can be created "on the fly" using the 
<b>Generate NX Warrant</b> button at the lower
left of the Warrant List table.  This feature is particularly useful for taking trains on or
off the visible layout to and from staging.
<p>
The button opens a window where occupancy blocks can be specified for the <b>Origin</b>, 
<b>Destination</b>, <b>Via</b> and <b>Avoid</b> blocks of the warrant.   Clicking on the 
Indicator Track Icon of a block will insert the block name into block text fields.  The 
<i>first click</i> sets the Origin block, the <i>second click</i> the Destination block, 
the <i>third</i> the Via block and the <i>fourth</i> the Avoid block.  This sequence is 
repeated mod 4.<A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml"> Creating and Editing Warrants</A>. has more
information about creating routes.</p>
<p>
The <b>Address</b>, <b>Train ID,</b>  and <b>Direction,</b> of the engine are set in this window
as well as  the parameters used for the speed changing ramps.  
Pressing the 
<b>Run NX Warrant</b> button computes the route and runs the addressed train at the specified 
speeds and direction.</p>
<p>
<H2>Tracking Trains</H2>
The fourth Warrants menu item opens the <b>Tracker Table</b>.  Pressing the <b>New Tracker</b>
button in this window opens a dialog to enter a train name and the OBlock it occupies.  Pressing
the done button creates a row in the Tracking Table.  The row shows the train name ane the block 
it currently occupies and the length of time it has occupied the block.  As the train moves from
block to block, this status is updated.  The Indicator Track Icons can display the train name.
<ul>
	<b>Note:</b> The <b>Edit Icon</b> popup menu item opens a dialog for Indicator Track Icons 
	have a <b>Display Train Name when occupied</b> checkbox to select to display text for 
	train tracking or warrant running.
</ul>
The window also has a <b>Refresh Tracker Info</b> button to poll the trackers listed in the 
Tracker table and a <b>OBlock Pick List</b> button to display a picklist.</p>
<p>
The location of the train can be set by typing, by dragging block name from the picklist, or by 
clicking on a Indicator Track Icon in the panel.</p>
<p>
Tracking can also be done for a train by dragging and dropping a Loco Icon onto the OBlock 
the train occupies.  This is the most simple way of tracking in that both the names and 
location are done with a single drag and drop.
<p>
<H2>Using Warrants in Logix</H2>
Several of the operations that can be done from the Warrant List and Warrant Editing frame
can be done with Logix Conditionals.  You may design and implement a dispatcher's panel
using the Warrant state variables and actions found in Logix.

<H3>Warrant State Variables</H3>
When a warrant has been allocated or is in effect, the following state variables can be tested
in a Logix conditional.
<ul>
        <li><b>Route Free</b>: - True when all blocks in the warrant route are not allocated
        to anyone and are not occipied.  False otherwise.</li>
        <li><b>Route Set</b>: - True when all blocks in the warrant route are allocated and the
        turnouts set for this warrant.  False otherwise.</li>
        <li><b>Route Allocated</b>: - True when all blocks in the warrant route are allocated
        to this warrant.  False otherwise.</li>
        <li><b>Route Occupied</b>: - True when none of the blocks in the warrant route, other
        than the origin block, are occipied.  (Assumes the train of this warrant is occupying
        the origin block).  False otherwise. </li>
        <li><b>Train Running</b>: - True when the train specified in the warrant is running 
        either in Learn Mode or Auto Run Mode.  False otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Warrant Actions</H3>
<ul>
        <li><b>Allocate Warrant Route</b>: - Allocates the route to this warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Deallocate Warrant</b>: - Deallocates the route of this warrant (only).  This will not
         deallocate the route of a different warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Set Route Turnouts</b>: - Sets the signals and turnouts for the route as far along the
         route that it can until it reaches an occupied block or a block allocated to another 
         warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Auto Run Train</b>: - Issue the throttle commands to the train in the warrant.  This
         should only be done when the train occupies the Origin block.</li>
        <li><b>Set Train Id</b>: - Set the engine consist to be used in the warrant from a trainId 
        in the Engine Roster.  Alternatively, the DCC address can be used to identify the engine.</li>
        <li><b>Set Train Name</b>: - Set the name of the train to display in the loco marker
         indicating the current position of the train when running.</li> 
        <li><b>Control Train</b>: - Send a control command (<b>Halt</b>, <b>Resume</b> or 
        <b>Abort)</b> to a running train under warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Set Throttle Factor</b>: - Set a multiplier for the recorded throttle setting.
         When the engine or consist of the train is changed, more or less power may be required.</li>
</ul>
