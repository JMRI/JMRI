      <h1>JMRI: Warrants</h1>

      <p>A Warrant in JMRI is a collection of information sufficient to run an automated train. It
      will set the turnouts for a specified route and drive the train over the route. When running,
      using block occupancy detection and signal configuration, it will make a best effort to
      control speed according to signal aspects or by occupancy of other trains or other track
      conditions ahead.<br>
      A JMRI Warrant is suggestive of what a warrant does on a prototype railroad, but there is no
      intention to replicate any particular railroad's mode of operation. It is simply the idea of
      giving an automated train the trackage rights to move from point A to point B (and then move
      it along). Warrants are issued using the <a href=
      "../display/ControlPanelEditor.shtml">Control Panel Editor</a> and the <a href=
      "WarrantTable.shtml">The Warrants List</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Warrants</strong> depend on having an accurate description of the layout in terms
      of <strong>OBlocks</strong>, <strong>Portals</strong> and <strong>OPaths</strong>.<br>
      <span class="since">since 2.7.8</span> These elements are created by entering data into the
      <strong><a href="OBlockTable.shtml">Occupancy Block Tables</a></strong> or by using the
      graphical interface of the <strong><a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit
      Builder</a></strong>, part of Control Panel Editor. Initially however, these tools are not
      visible in the Panel Editor as they require some preparations, described next.</p>

      <h2>Get Started with Warrants</h2>
      Definitions of OBlocks, Portals and OPaths may be found <a href="OBlockTable.shtml">here</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>First, it is important that the <strong>scale</strong> of your layout is known so that
        the Warrant can compute the distances required when encountering signals. Open the <strong>
          Warrants</strong> pane of JMRI <strong><a href=
          "NXWarrant.shtml#prefs">Preferences</a></strong> to set the layout scale. There are other
          parameters related to Warrants there that you may wish to change later, but the defaults
          are generally sufficient without further change. See <a href=
          "NXWarrant.shtml#prefs">Warrant Preferences</a> for information about configuration of
          Warrant parameters.
        </li>

        <li>Next, open the Occupancy Block Tables by choosing the <strong>Tools ⇒ Tables ⇒
        Occupancy Blocks</strong> menu item from the main PanelPro menu bar, or the <strong>Add
        Items ⇒ Occupancy Blocks</strong> menu item from within Control Panel Editor.</li>

        <li>Create your OBlocks, Portals and OPaths using these tables, as described in <a href=
        "OBlockEdit.shtml">Creating and Editing OBlocks, Portals and OPaths</a>.
        </li>

        <li>OBlocks, Portals and Paths can also be created using the <strong>Circuit
        Builder</strong> tool found in the Control Panel Editor. Using that tool, OBlocks, Portals
        and OPaths are defined by selecting track icons of your layout diagram. The Circuit Builder
        can be opened using the <strong>Open Circuit Builder</strong> menu item under the <strong>
          Warrants</strong> menu. Follow the <a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit
          Builder</a> instructions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Circuit Builder Tool</h2>
      <span class="since">since 2.12</span>
      <p>Circuit Builder is an interactive tool that creates OBlocks, Portals and Paths
      graphically. In order to use the tool, you need to have a track diagram of your layout
      expressed with track icons (track segments and turnout icons) in a Control Panel Editor
      panel. OBlocks and OPaths are created by clicking on the track icons. The Circuit Builder can
      convert the track segments and turnout icons of your Panel into Indicator Track and Indicator
      Turnout icons. These icons display the status of the OBlock they represent by color, i.e.
      whether the track circuit of the OBlock is Occupied or Unoccupied, whether a Warrant has
      allocated it or whether a Train under Warrant currently is proceeding over the circuit.
      Details are found in the <a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a>
      Help.</p>

      <h3>Compatibility with Layout Editor</h3>

      <p>Layout Editor panel Blocks are created and stored independently from OBlocks, although
      they can share use of the same Sensors for determining block occupancy. OBlocks, Portals and
      OPaths can be created manually (without using Circuit Builder in a CPE panel) and imported
      from Layout Editor Blocks (see the command under <strong>Options</strong> in the <a href=
      "OBlockTable.shtml">Occupancy Block Table.</a> It is possible to use OBlocks, Portals, and
      OPaths without a CPE panel but that would be unusual.</p>

      <h2>Creating a Warrant</h2>

      <p>In order to create a <strong>Warrant</strong> you must first have created two or more
      OBlocks. These Blocks don't have to be fully defined, but their existence indicates that you
      are interested in using Warrants, that is, you have a block to start a train and a block to
      stop it. When two or more OBlocks exist in PanelPro, Control Panel Editor will change the
      <strong>Warrants</strong> menu to include the following menu items:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Warrant List</strong> - Opens a table of Warrants from which you can control
          warrant routes and dispatch trains. See <a href="WarrantTable.shtml">The Warrant
          List</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Edit Warrant...</strong> - Shows the list of existing Warrants. Selecting one
          will open a Warrant Editing Window. The operations of this frame are discussed in
          <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing Warrants</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Create New Warrant</strong> - Opens the window used for creating and editing
          warrants. This window has several display modes. In this case, it is opened in the mode
          to create a route for a new warrant. The <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and
          Editing Warrants</a> help page has information about creating a warrant.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Train Trackers</strong> - Opens the Tracker Table window. The <a href=
          "Tracker.shtml">Train Trackers</a> help page discusses how the movements of a train can
          be displayed as they move from one occupancy block to another.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Create NX Warrant</strong> - Opens a window to create a temporary eNtry/eXit (NX)
          Warrant. This is discussed in <a href="NXWarrant.shtml">About NX Warrants</a>.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Open Session Log</strong> - <span class="since">since 3.7.3</span> Opens a
        window to name a file that records the Warrant and train tracking status messages.</li>

        <li>
          <strong>Open Circuit builder</strong> - Opens a window for the circuit Builder to present
          its options for interactively editing and creating OBlocks, Portals, Paths. Also
          configures Signals and Indicator Track icons. <a href=
          "../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a> has details.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Warrants without Occupancy Detection</h3>

      <p>It is possible to create and run Warrants without block detection. OBlocks can be defined
      when they do not necessarily have to have detection sensors. Such blocks are called "Dark
      Blocks". Dark blocks, the portals and paths within the block can be defined for a layout
      diagram without detection sensors. A Warrant can be recorded and can be played back,
      including having its route set. However, be advised for such trains without detection sensors
      <strong><em>there is no protection for having it collide with other trains or throwing
      switches under other trains.</em></strong> Trains will run <strong>merely</strong> according
      to the <em>elapsed times</em> and <em>throttle settings</em> that were recorded.</p>

      <h3>Warrants without Turnout Control</h3>

      <p>It is possible to create and run Warrants without having turnouts thrown by JMRI. JMRI
      internal turnout devices will show the route on the layout panel, but you will need to
      manually set and verify that the route is properly set on the layout itself. Again, the train
      will proceed according to the <em>elapsed times</em> and <em>throttle settings</em> that were
      recorded.</p>

      <h3>The Importance of Block Path Lengths</h3>

      <p>A Warrant detects a position of its train when it enters a block having occupancy
      detection. All other positional information must be calculated. For this, the track speed of
      the train and the length of the path it is on must be known.</p>

      <p>To properly respond to a slower speed change required by a signal aspect, the train should
      prototypically slow down and complete the speed change before entering the block the signal
      protects. This requires the Warrant to calculate the time and position for the slowdown to
      occur.</p>

      <p>See <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">When Warrant Speeds Are Modified</a> for what track
      conditions require speed changes, they are detected and how Warrants make gradual changes of
      speed.</p>

      <h3>Warrant Types</h3>

      <p>There are three types of Warrants available:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>Recorded Script Warrant</strong>, where throttle commands are recorded from a
        throttle you use to drive a train over preselected route. The Warrant then replicates all
        the commands when played back. To create a Recorded Script Warrant, select the
        <strong>Warrants ⇒ Tables ⇒ Create New Warrant</strong> menu item and select 'Prototypical'
        or 'Add Speeds' as Warrant type.</li>

        <li>An <strong>NX Warrant</strong> (eNtry/eXit), where throttle commands are generated
        automatically to move a train between Blocks chosen by you "on the fly". A dialog allows
        you to choose start and destination distances and to set the maximum Throttle settings. To
        create an NX Warrant, select the <strong>Warrants ⇒ Tables ⇒ Create NX Warrant</strong>
        menu item. More on <a href="NXWarrant.shtml">NX Warrants</a>
        </li>

        <li>A <strong>Fast Reacting Warrant</strong>. This type does not follow the usual Warrant
        rules, but reacts to signals when entering their approach block with an immediate speed
        change. The throttle settings are a fixed proportion of the Aspect Speed Names in Warrant
        Preferences. This type of warrant is better suited to smaller layouts. To create this type
        of Warrant, select the <strong>Warrants ⇒ Tables ⇒ Create New Warrant</strong> menu item
        and select 'Fast Reacting' as Warrant type. More on <a href="SCWarrant.shtml">Fast Reacting
        Warrants</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creating a Warrant</h2>

      <p>A Warrant consists of two parts:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Route</strong> over which a Train will run</li>

        <li>the <strong>Commands</strong> it will receive when running over the route.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To define the commands for a Warrant, you drive the train over the route you selected and
      the commands you used are recorded for playback later. For an NX Warrant, commands are
      generated automatically for the route you have selected.</p>

      <h3 id="CreateRoute">Creating the Route</h3>

      <p>A Warrant Route is a series of Block Paths linked together so a Train may travel over it.
      A Warrant Route is created by first choosing an <strong>Origin block</strong>, a starting
      Path and a Portal to exit the originating block. Then, a <strong>Destination block</strong>
      is chosen and a Path on which to end the route. Optionally, you may also choose a
      <strong>Via</strong> Block, that is, a Block the route <em>must</em> include and an
      <strong>Avoid</strong> Block, that is, a Block the route <em>must not</em> include. Blocks
      are inserted by typing in the block name or dragging it from a displayed OBlock Table. Blocks
      can also be selected in Control Panel Editor by clicking on track icons that represent these
      OBlocks. To use this feature, your Control Panel must have your layout depicted by Indicator
      Track Icons placed there either by Circuit Builder or manually defined by you.<br>
      Successive clicks cycle through the four block fields and fill in the name of the Block you
      clicked on.</p>

      <p>A computer algorithm determines all the intermediate blocks, portals and paths to make the
      route. If more than one route meets the criterion, you are presented with a list to review
      and select the route you want. Note that the Portal and Paths need to be chosen for the route
      also. If no route is found, a dialog is offered where you can examine the routes that were
      attempted with the current Block, Portal and Path selections. <a href=
      "CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing Warrants</a> has more information about
      creating routes.</p>

      <h3>Scripting the Train Action</h3>

      <p>The second part of a Warrant are the throttle commands to control the train as it
      traverses the route. These commands are recorded automatically by running a train over the
      route in "Learn Mode" or are generated automatically as an "NX Warrant". The script commands
      contain the elapsed time between commands. Playback will duplicate this timing. However, when
      a Warrant is run with a different engine or a different consist, or even the same train
      depending whether the motor is hot or cold, this timing may not be replicated exactly.
      Because of this the command script is synchronized upon entering each detection OBlock. So,
      if the train is slow in reaching the next block, the commands for the next block will be
      delayed until the train enters the block. Conversely, if the train reaches the next block
      ahead of time, any remaining commands in the block just left are issued immediately so that
      the Train can <em>catch up</em> to the script.</p>

      <p>Warrant scripts are recorded or generated with a <em>"Clear"</em> Aspect throughout the
      route, even through blocks with restricted speeds. These speeds in the script are the
      <em>"Normal"</em> speeds. However, after creation when running, track conditions may not be
      <em>"Clear",</em> due to a signal's speed restriction, a block's speed restriction, occupancy
      by a rogue train or even intervention by you to halt the train.<br>
      Warrants are able to deal with these restrictions and will modify their <em>"Normal"</em>
      speeds as needed to comply with the restrictions. <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">When Warrant
      Speeds Are Modified</a> explains this relationship.</p>

      <h4>Recording Scripts</h4>

      <p>A Warrant script is written by putting a JMRI screen Throttle into <em>Learn Mode</em> to
      record all the throttle commands you make when driving the train over the route. The script
      can then be replayed to drive the train automatically. All possible throttle functions can be
      recorded and played back. <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing Warrants</a>
      details how to do this.</p>

      <p>With LocoNet you may steal the address and manual LocoNet throttle. For other command
      systems, a WiFi throttle may take the same address as the screen throttle and be used to
      record a walk around script.</p>

      <h4>Generated Scripts</h4>

      <p>For NX Warrants, the script is generated by the Warrant itself. It ramps the train up to a
      specified speed and ramps it down at the destination. It obeys all the traffic occupancy and
      signals as do the Recorded Warrants. See <a href="NXWarrant.shtml">About NX Warrants</a> for
      how to run these.</p>

      <h4>"Normal" Track Speeds</h4>
      When recording a Warrant throttle command script, the train should be run with all track
      conditions set to "Clear". NX Warrant script are generated using "Clear" track conditions
      also. This is reported in status messages as the "<strong>Normal</strong>" speed. However,
      when running the Warrant, the train may be confronted with occupation ahead by another train
      or a signal required a reduction of speed. Warrants respond to these and other track
      conditions by automatically modifying the scripted throttle settings. <a href=
      "SpeedChanges.shtml">When Warrant Speeds Are Modified</a> has details about how Warrants
      modify recorded speeds.
      <h3>Customizing the Script</h3>
      A Warrant script can be edited to modify the recorded commands. Additional non-throttle
      events can be added to the script such as triggering or responding to external sensors.
      <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing Warrants</a> has more information
      about creating and customizing scripts.
      <h2>Using the Warrant List</h2>

      <p>The <strong>Warrant List</strong> menu item opens the <strong>Warrant Table</strong>. Each
      row represents a Warrant that was created and saved or a running NX Warrant. The Warrant
      Table reports the current status of each Warrant in the list and can issue commands to Halt,
      Resume or Abort. Warrant routes can be allocated, i.e. reserved for that Warrant, the
      Turnouts for route can be set and when the Warrant is run, its status is shown and controlled
      using the columns in the table. See <a href="WarrantTable.shtml">The Warrant List</a> for
      more information.</p>

      <h2>Tracking Trains</h2>
      Any train running on the layout can be tracked. The layout must be represented with Indicator
      Track Icons to track trains. Train Trackers, the fourth item in the Warrants menu, opens the
      <strong>Tracker Table</strong>. Pressing the <strong>New Tracker...</strong> button in this
      window opens a dialog to enter a train name and the OBlock it occupies. Pressing the [Create]
      button creates a row in the Tracking Table. The row shows the train name and the block it
      currently occupies and the length of time it has occupied the block. As the train moves from
      block to block, this status is updated. The Indicator Track Icons can display the train name.
      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Edit Icon</strong> popup menu item opens a dialog for
        Indicator Track Icons containing a <strong>Display Train Name when occupied</strong>
        checkbox to select to display text for train tracking or Warrant running.
      </div>

      <p>The window also has a <strong>Refresh Tracker Info</strong> button to poll the trackers
      listed in the Tracker table and an <strong>OBlock Pick List</strong> button to display a
      picklist.</p>

      <p>The location of the train can be set by typing, by dragging block name from the picklist,
      or by clicking on an Indicator Track Icon in the panel.</p>

      <p>Tracking can also be done for a train by dragging and dropping a Loco Icon onto the OBlock
      the train occupies. This is the most simple way of tracking in that both the name and
      location are done with a single drag and drop.</p>

      <h2>Using Warrants in Logix</h2>

      <p>Several of the operations that can be done from the Warrant List and Warrant Editing frame
      can be done with Logix Conditionals. You may design and implement a dispatcher's panel using
      the Warrant state variables and actions found in Logix.</p>

      <h3>Warrant State Variables</h3>

      <p>When a Warrant has been allocated or is in effect, the following state variables can be
      tested in a Logix conditional.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Route Free</strong>: - True when all Blocks in the Warrant route are not
        allocated to anyone and are not occupied. False otherwise.</li>

        <li><strong>Route Set</strong>: - True when all blocks in the Warrant route are allocated
        and the turnouts set for this Warrant. False otherwise.</li>

        <li><strong>Route Allocated</strong>: - True when all blocks in the Warrant route are
        allocated to this Warrant. False otherwise.</li>

        <li><strong>Route Occupied</strong>: - True when none of the blocks in the Warrant route,
        other than the origin block, are occupied. (Assumes the train of this Warrant is occupying
        the origin block). False otherwise.</li>

        <li><strong>Train Running</strong>: - True when the train specified in the Warrant is
        running either in Learn Mode or Auto Run Mode. False otherwise.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Warrant Actions</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Allocate Warrant Route</strong>: - Allocates the route to this Warrant.</li>

        <li><strong>Deallocate Warrant</strong>: - Deallocates the route of this Warrant (only).
        This will not deallocate the route of a different Warrant.</li>

        <li><strong>Set Route Turnouts</strong>: - Sets the signals and turnouts for the route as
        far along the route that it can until it reaches an occupied block or a block allocated to
        another Warrant.</li>

        <li><strong>Auto Run Train</strong>: - Issue the throttle commands to the train in the
        Warrant. This should only be done when the train occupies the Origin block.</li>

        <li><strong>Set Train Id</strong>: - Set the engine consist to be used in the Warrant from
        a trainId in the Engine Roster. Alternatively, the DCC address can be used to identify the
        engine.</li>

        <li><strong>Set Train Name</strong>: - Set the name of the train to display in the loco
        marker indicating the current position of the train when running.</li>

        <li><strong>Control Train</strong>: - Send a control command (<strong>Halt</strong>,
        <strong>Resume</strong> or <strong>Abort)</strong> to a running train under warrant.</li>
      </ul>
