      <h1>Warrants: Creating and Editing OBlocks, Portals and OPaths</h1>

      <p>Start by entering each Occupancy Block of your layout into
      the <b>Occupancy Block Table</b>:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Enter a System Name for the OBlock. If you do not
        preface the entry with "OB", it will be prepended to your
        entry automatically.</li>

        <li>(Optionally) Enter a User Name for the OBlock.</li>

        <li>Enter the System Name or User Name of the detection
        Sensor for the Block.<br>
          <i>You may skip entering this for now and come back and
          enter it later.</i><br>
          Note: If there is more than one Sensor that detects
          occupancy of the Block, 'OR' them together and trigger a
          single Internal Sensor to use for this entry. For
          example, suppose LS10, LS11 and LS12 are detection
          Sensors and IS100 is an Internal Sensor. Presuming
          "Active" means Occupied, write a Logix Conditional with
          these three state Variables:

          <ul>
            <li>Sensor "LS10" state is Sensor Active</li>

            <li>Sensor "LS11" state is Sensor Active</li>

            <li>Sensor "LS12" state is Sensor Active</li>
          </ul>

          Select <b>OR</b> as the Logic Operator<br>
          and add as Actions:

          <ul>
            <li>On Change to True, set Sensor, "IS100" to
            Active.</li>

            <li>On Change to False, set Sensor, "IS100" to
            Inactive.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Note: Upon entering a System Name, the row of a new
          entry will jump to its sorting position as ordered by
          System Name. To continue editing the row, look for it at
          the top of the window. It will stay in place as long as
          it has the same System Name.</p>

          <p class="flushleft">Next, enter the Portals between the
          Blocks into the <b>Portal Table</b>:</p>
        </li>

        <li>For each point between the Blocks you have defined
        in the Occupancy Block Table, enter a Portal row for each
        Portal (gap) between the two Blocks.

          <p>A pair of adjacent Blocks may have several Portals
          between them. This is expected, so just give each Portal
          a unique name. The Block names can be dragged from the
          Occupancy Block table to save typing.</p>

          <p>Note: The computer will notify you from time to time
          until you have entered a Block on each side of the Portal
          Name. It doesn't matter on which side of the Portal Name
          you enter a Block Name, just be sure to enter both
          sides</p>

          <p>Note: It may be helpful to open the <b>Block-Portal
          Cross Reference Table</b> to review whether all the
          portals have been entered.</p>

          <p class="flushleft">Next, If there are Signals at a
          Portal, enter them into the <b>Signal Table</b>:</p>
        </li>

        <li>Enter the System Name or User Name of the Signal. This
        may be either a SignalMast or SignalHead.</li>

        <li>Enter the name of the Block <b><i>facing</i></b> the
        Signal into the <b>From (Approach) Block</b> column. It is
        important that the approaching Block of the Signal is
        correctly named. This is the Block that will detect when a
        speed change might be needed.</li>

        <li>Enter the Portal Name or the name of the Block whose
        entrance is protected.</li>

        <li>Enter any delay of milliseconds to wait after entering
        the approach Block before changing the train speed (This
        time delay is used only when the signal indicates a speed
        change).

          <p class="flushleft">Next, identify the Paths in each
          Block:</p>
        </li>

        <li>Moving through the Occupancy Block Table row by row,
        complete these steps:

          <ul>
            <li>Press the <b>Paths</b> button and open the
            <b>Block-Path</b> Table for the row;</li>

            <li>Enter a path name for a Path within the Block of
            the row in the <b>Path Name</b> column.<br>
            Note: The name of the Block is in quotes in the title
            bar of the table.</li>

            <li>Enter the names of the Portals where the Path
            enters and exits the Block.<br>

              <p>Note: It doesn't matter on which side of the Path
              name you enter a Portal name. Dead end spurs will
              only have one Portal.</p>

              <p>Reminder: You may use 'Drag and Drop' to enter
              text. When selecting an item to drag, it may require
              two clicks; one to select the row and a second to
              select the column entry. Holding the second click
              down, you can drag the text from that row, column
              field.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="flushleft">Finally, complete the definition of
          each Path in each Block:</p>
        </li>

        <li>For each Path in each <b>Block-Path table</b>, complete
        these steps:

          <ul>
            <li>Press the <b>Turnouts</b> button and open the
            <b>Block-Path-Turnout</b> table for the each row in the
            <b>Block-Path</b> table</li>

            <li>Enter the System Name or User Name of a Turnout in
            the Path.<br>

              <p>Note: The name of the Path and its Block are
              displayed in quotes in the title bar of the
              table.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Enter the position of the Turnout in the <b>Turnout
            Setting</b> column - either 'Closed' or 'Thrown'.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="flushleft">Most likely you will have
          encountered several dialogs urging you to fix this or
          that; try to resolve all of them.</p>

          <p class="flushleft">Now, you are ready to define some
          Routes for Warrants. Of course, there will probably still
          be a few errors or missing items; the 'Create Warrant'
          frame provides a tool to find and fix them:</p>
        </li>

        <li>Select <b>Create New Warrant</b> from the
        <b>Warrants</b> menu in a Panel Editor Panel.</li>
      </ol>
