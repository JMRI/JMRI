      <h1>Warrants: When Warrant Speeds Are Modified</h1>

      <p>Regardless of the throttle setting and intended track speed in the command script of a
      Warrant, track conditions may occur that require a restriction of the track speed. "Stop"
      aspects of signals, occupancy or allocation to another Warrant will deny permission to
      proceed. Other aspects of signals or block limits may require a reduction of speed. For an
      overview discussion of Warrants, see <a href="Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>.</p>

      <h2>Warrants and Speed Restrictions</h2>

      <p>A train running under a Warrant must be aware of track conditions ahead. Signals may
      indicate reduced speed or permission to return to normal speed. Blocks may impose yard limit
      speed restrictions. Rogue trains may show up unexpectedly in the route. In our imagination,
      we can presume their detection means our warrant "engineer" sees a fuss. For each of these
      cases the warrant must look ahead, detect the need for a speed change and schedule the right
      time to do it - all the while making the change smoothly and completing it in prototypical
      fashion.</p>

      <h3>Configuring Speed Restrictions</h3>

      <p>For a warrant to detect a <strong>signaled speed change</strong> the signal must be
      configured in the Occupancy Block Tables. The Signal Table there configures the entrance
      Portal to the OBlock that the signal protects. The warrant then uses the signal system
      configured for the signal to define the aspect speed.<br>
      Likewise, <strong>Block Speeds</strong> are configured in the Occupancy Block Tables. A
      column in the OBlock Table allows you to choose an aspect speed that the Warrant will enforce
      before entering the block.</p>

      <p>When an <strong>occupancy</strong> sensor is activated ahead of the train on its route,
      the warrant will take note of it and bring the train to a stop before entering the block.</p>

      <p>Finally, you can manually instruct the Warrant to ramp down to a stop using the
      <strong>Halt</strong> control command. - or issue an emergency stop with the
      <strong>E-Stop</strong> command, Also, you can ramp up from a stop and resume the train's
      former speed with a <strong>Resume</strong> command. With the exception of E-Stop, all these
      unscripted speed changes are made smoothly.</p>

      <p>When a warrant ramps down a speed change due to a signal, block or rouge occupancy
      condition, That speed change remains in effect until the condition is removed. At that time
      the speed is ramped up to the previous "normal" speed. The precedence order is: rouge
      occupancy, signal aspect, block speed.</p>

      <h2>How Signal Aspects and Block Speeds Modify a Train's Speed</h2>
      When a speed restriction is required before entering a block, the speed change needs to begin
      at some point before entry.
      <p>When a Warrant is running and its train enters a block, it looks ahead to see if any speed
      changes are coming up. The look ahead distance must be adequate for the train to be able to
      stop should that be needed. The warrant calculates the look ahead distance to be what is
      needed to stop from its present speed. This distance may include several blocks. If a signal
      or block is encountered within this look ahead distance, and the aspect protecting the block
      indicates the speed must be restricted, then the warrant performs a "ramp down".</p>

      <p>When a speed restriction is lifted, the problem is much simpler. The warrant can
      immediately begin a "ramp up" upon entering the block.</p>

      <h3>A Note about Ramps</h3>
      When a warrant ramps up or down, it does it stepwise. In order for it to done smoothly in
      prototypical fashion, it depends on the following parameters:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ramp Step Time</strong> The number of milliseconds between making throttle
        setting changes.</li>

        <li><strong>Ramp Step Throttle Increment</strong> The initial throttle increment when
        increasing speed, or last increment when decreasing speed.</li>
      </ul>
      These are configured in Warrant Preferences. See <a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Warrants">Warrant Preferences</a> for information
      about configuration of Warrant parameters.
      <h3>Parameters Needed for Look Ahead</h3>

      <p>Both the look ahead distance and the time when to begin the speed change require knowing
      the track speed. Thus to get the train to begin and end its speed changes at the proper
      points, and relating the throttle settings to the actual track speed, some crucial
      information is needed. Without such information a fast running engine may overrun the point
      where a speed change expects to be completed, or a slow running train may stop too far short
      of where it is expected.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Distance</strong> the train must travel. <em>Your wild guess is better than any
          default.</em> <strong>Block Lengths</strong> are needed for distances. There is a length
          column in the OBlock Table. (Use menu <strong>Add Items -&gt; Occupancy Blocks</strong>).
          Also the <strong>Paths</strong> column in the table opens its path tables. Each Path
          Table has a length column as well.
          <p>Likewise the menus <strong>Circuit Builder -&gt; Add/Edit Circuit OBlock</strong> and
          <strong>Circuit Builder -&gt; Add/Edit Circuit OPaths</strong> in Circuit Builder have
          text fields to enter lengths.</p>

          <p>Inches or centimeters may be used for all of these fields.</p>

          <p>When no block length is specified error messages are written to the console and you
          may have trains over-running their stopping points. It is <strong><em>highly
          recommended</em></strong> that path lengths be specified. If the paths within a block
          vary widely, path lengths should be set. Otherwise, path lengths are inherited from the
          block length.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Layout Scale</strong> is needed for distances when speed is expressed as Mph or
        Kmph. This is set from a drop down box at the
        <strong>Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</strong> menu of the main PanelPro window</li>

        <li>
          <strong>Track Speed</strong> of the train. A correlation of the throttle settings to the
          actual speed of the train on the layout must be known. For this two methods are used.
          <ul>
            <li>A first approximation is the <strong>"Throttle Setting/Speed Factor"</strong> value
            at Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants. When used, this factor is a linear multiplier to
            relate throttle setting to track speed. <strong>Note</strong> this is a global value
            for all of the locomotives in your fleet and over the entire speed range of each.
            Obviously this may not function optimally. However, it could be satisfactory for your
            tastes.</li>

            <li>For more precision a <strong>Speed Profile</strong> can be used for each
            locomotive. These provide track speed values that give more accurate calculations for
            time and distances. The Speed Profiler is found at <strong>Roster-&gt;Speed
            Profiling</strong> is used to create a speed profilr for each locomotive or
            consist.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Getting Speed Profiles for your Trains</h3>

      <p>Speed Profiles are maintained in the Roster and there is a tool that will create them at
      <strong>Roster-&gt;Speed Profiling</strong> The tool can measure a track speed for each step
      in the throttle. However, interpolation and extrapolation have been implemented so it is not
      necessary to go to such detail. Five or six data points well distributed over the throttle's
      range is quite sufficient.</p>

      <h2 id="autoSpeedProfile">Automatic Speed Profiling</h2>

      <p>Since <strong><em>Release 4.9.2</em></strong> track speed of an engine/consist is measured
      when that address is used for running a Warrant. A data point is recorded whenever a path
      with known length is traversed with a known throttle setting. The data is kept for the layout
      session and when the session ends this Session Speed Profile can be merged into the Roster
      Speed Profile. Warrant Preferences provides choices for how you may want to manage the
      merging of Roster Speed Profiles. See <a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Warrants">Warrant Preferences</a> for how you want to
      manage the end of session behavior. The default is you are prompted for how you want to treat
      each Session Speed Profile.</p>

      <h3>Track Speeds for Throttle Settings</h3>

      <p>If you used the Roster Speed Profiling tool most likely you ran an engine running light
      over a straight level track. With Warrant dynamic speed profiling, measurements are made over
      straight level track, but also upgrade, down grade, curved gently or severely, running light
      or pulling 30+ cars. <em>The track speeds are not going to be all the same for a given
      throttle setting.</em> When merging, new values are averaged with the old, with the intention
      of a composite speed profile that reflects average use.</p>

      <p>At some point, merging this data may make a speed profile that is not monotonic
      increasing. (Certainly increasing throttle setting increases speed). When this anomaly occurs
      the speed profile is displayed and the cells where the profile is not monotonic are marked in
      red. You may edit the table to correct it. Whether to do this editing is your choice. Perhaps
      it is best to let the anomalies remain and have the profile resolve itself - or do the
      editing after letting more values accumulate. Of course, a value resulting when the train was
      shorted or was dragging a derailed car should be deleted.</p>

      <h4>Editing a Speed Profile</h4>

      <p>When given the opportunity to edit, either the value of a single cell can be changed or an
      entire row deleted. Replacing a value with 0.0, causes that speed step to be ignored. When a
      track speed is needed for a throttle setting there, an interpolated value is used. If values
      in both directions are 0.0, the row might as well be deleted.</p>

      <h2>Aspect Speed Table and its Interpretation</h2>

      <p>Speeds are named in the aspects.xml files that signal masts use in the Signal Mast System.
      These speed names are also used in the Blocks tables. To control train speed, values must be
      assigned to these speed names. The Aspect Speed Map found at
      <em>&gt;Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</em> provides a value for each named speed. It is
      up to the user to assign a value to the name and a meaning to the value. On the Warrant
      Preferences Pane are four radio buttons to assign meaning to the values entered into the
      Speed Map Table.</p>

      <p>When a signal or block defines an aspect speed by name, the warrant looks up the name in
      the Aspect Speed Table and uses the value there tp modify the speed of the train.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Percent of Normal</strong> - The value is a percentage of the recorded
        ("Normal") speed. <em>Any speed name that is restrictive must have a values less than
        100.</em> The warrant reduces the "Normal" scripted speed by this value as a
        percentage.</li>

        <li><strong>Percent of Full Throttle</strong> - The value is an absolute throttle setting
        expressed as a percentage of full throttle. <em>All speed names must be a number between 0
        and 100.</em> The warrant sets the modified speed to be the value as a percentage of the
        full throttle setting.</li>

        <li><strong>Miles per hour</strong> - The value is the scale speed expressed as miles per
        hour. <em>All speed names must be expressed as miles per hour.</em> The warrant, using
        layout scale, converts the value to track speed and finds the corresponding throttle
        setting for the modified speed.</li>

        <li><strong>Kilometers per Hour</strong> - The value is the scale speed expressed as
        Kilometers per hour. <em>All speed names must be expressed as kilometers per hour.</em> The
        warrant, using layout scale, converts the value to track speed and finds the corresponding
        throttle setting for the modified speed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To sum up; if you are not fussy about being prototypical and always want to see speed
      change when signals are passed, use "Percent of Normal". If you have calibrated a sufficient
      Speed Profile for each of your engines you can use either of the last two speed
      interpretations which express throttle setting in terms of scale speed.</p>

      <h3>The Signal Head Appearance Table</h3>

      <p>If signal heads are used on the layout, their appearances can be mapped to the speed names
      of signal masts in this table on the Warrant Preferences pane. For the above, the warrant
      maps appearance name to speed name to value.</p>

      <p>One use of this is to use Virtual Signal Heads to dynamically influence the behavior of
      warrants. The appearance of these Signal Heads can be set either by panel icons or Logix.
      Since there are 8 possible Signal Head appearances, additional speed names can be created so
      a unique speed can be made for each appearance.</p>

      <h3>Editing the Speed Map Table</h3>

      <p>Rows can be added or deleted. The default speed map has the names "Fifty" and "Sixty".
      These names only appear in signal mast systems for UP-2008 and BNSF-1996, so they can safely
      be deleted if you do use these signal systems. You only need but <em>must have</em> all the
      speed names that appear in the signal system you have configured for your layout.</p>

      <p>If you add a new speed name for a signal head appearance, then add a row for that name in
      the Signal Map Table.</p>

      <h2>Block Speed Names</h2>

      <p>A speed name can be set for each Block by selecting a name from the <strong>Speed
      Notch</strong> column of the OBlock Table. One use of this feature could be to enforce a yard
      limit speed. Unlike signal speed names, block speed names are bi-directional.
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> To return a Warrant's speed to normal when leaving a yard limit, the
      speed names of the OBlocks on either side of the yard block should set to "Normal". Use care
      when combining this feature with signals to avoid providing conflicting speed change
      messages.</p>

      <p>To unset an OBlock speed name, choose the blank setting from the <strong>Speed
      Limit</strong> column. As with the absence of a signal, when there is no speed name the
      Warrant continues at its current speed.</p>
