      <h1>Warrants: When Warrant Speeds Are Modified</h1>

      <p>Regardless of the throttle setting and intended track
      speed in the command script of a Warrant, track conditions
      may occur that require a restriction of the track speed.
      "Stop" aspects of signals, occupancy or allocation to another
      Warrant will deny permission to proceed. Other aspects of
      signals or block limits may require a reduction of speed.
      For an overview discussion of Warrants, see <a href=
      "Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>.</p>

      <h2>Warrants and Speed Restrictions</h2>
      <p>A train running under
      a Warrant must be aware of track conditions ahead. Signals
      may indicate reduced speed or permission to return to normal
      speed. Blocks may impose yard limit speed restrictions. Rogue
      trains may show up unexpectedly in the route. In our
      imagination, we can presume
      their detection means our warrant "engineer" sees a fuss. For
      each of these cases the warrant must look ahead, detect the
      need for a speed change and schedule the right time to do it
      - all the while making the change smoothly and completing it
      in prototypical fashion.</p>
      
      <h3>Configuring Speed Restrictions</h3>
      <p>For a warrant to detect a <b>signaled speed change</b> the signal
      must be configured in the Occupancy Block Tables. 
      The Signal Table there configures the entrance Portal to the
      OBlock that the signal protects.  The warrant then uses the 
      signal system configured for the signal to define the aspect
      speed.<br>
      Likewise, <b>Block Speeds</b> are configured in the Occupancy
      Block Tables.  A column in the OBlock Table allows you to
      choose an aspect speed that the Warrant will enforce
      before entering the block.</p>
      
      <p>When an <b>occupancy</b> sensor is activated ahead of the train
      on its route, the warrant will take note of it and
      bring the train to a stop before entering the block.</p>
 
      <p>Finally, you can manually instruct the Warrant to ramp
      down to a stop using the <b>Halt</b> control command.
      - or issue an emergency stop with the <b>E-Stop</b> command,
      Also, you can ramp up from a stop and resume the train's 
      former speed with a <b>Resume</b> command. With the exception
      of E-Stop, all these unscripted speed changes are made smoothly.</p>
      
	  <p>When a warrant ramps down a speed change due to a signal, block
      or rouge occupancy condition, That speed change remains in
      effect until the condition is removed. At that time the
      speed is ramped up to the previous "normal" speed.  The
      precedence order is: rouge occupancy, signal aspect, block speed.</p>
            
      <h2>How Signal Aspects and Block Speeds Modify a Train's
      Speed</h2>
      When a speed restriction is required before entering a block,
      the speed change needs to begin at some point before entry.

      <p>When a Warrant is running and its train enters a
      block, it looks ahead to see if any speed changes are coming
      up. The look ahead distance must be adequate for the train to
      be able to stop should that be needed. The warrant calculates
      the look ahead distance to be what is needed to stop from its 
      present speed. This distance may include several blocks. 
      If a signal or block is
      encountered within this look ahead distance, and the aspect
      protecting the block indicates the speed must be restricted,
      then the warrant performs a "ramp down".</p>
      
      <p>When a speed restriction is lifted, the problem is much
      simpler.  The warrant can immediately begin a "ramp up" upon
      entering the block.

       <h3>A Note about Ramps</h3>
       When a warrant ramps up or down, it does it stepwise. In
       order for it to done smoothly in prototypical fashion, it
       depends on the following parameters:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ramp Step Time</b> The number of milliseconds 
        between making throttle setting changes.</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Step Throttle Increment</b> The initial
        throttle increment when increasing speed, or last
        increment when decreasing speed.</li> 
      </ul>
      These are configured in Warrant Preferences. See <a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Warrants">Warrant
      Preferences</a> for information about configuration of
      Warrant parameters.
      
       <h3>Parameters Needed for Look Ahead</h3>
       <p>Both the
       look ahead distance and the time when to begin the speed
       change require knowing the track speed. Thus to get the
       train to begin and end its speed changes at the proper points,
       and relating the throttle settings to the actual track
       speed, some crucial information is needed. Without such 
       information a fast running
       engine may overrun the point where a speed change expects to
       be completed, or a slow running train may stop too far short
       of where it is expected.</p>

       <ul>
        <li><b>Distance</b> the train must travel. <i>Your
          wild guess is better than any default.</i>
          <b>Block Lengths</b> are needed for distances.  There
          is a length column in the OBlock Table. (Use menu
          <b>Add Items -&gt; Occupancy Blocks</b>).  Also  the
          <b>Paths</b> column in the table opens its path tables. 
          Each Path Table has a length column as well.  
          <p>Likewise the menus 
          <b>Circuit Builder -&gt; Add/Edit Circuit OBlock</b> 
          and <b>Circuit Builder -&gt; Add/Edit Circuit OPaths</b>
          in Circuit Builder have text fields to enter 
          lengths.</p> 
          <p>Inches or centimeters may be used for all of these fields.
          <p>When no block length is specified error messages
          are written to the console and you may have trains 
          over-running their stopping points.  It is 
          <b><i>highly recommended</i></b>
          that path lengths be specified.  If the 
          paths within a block vary widely, path lengths
          should be set. Otherwise, path
          lengths are inherited from the block length.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Layout Scale</b> is needed for distances when speed is
        expressed as Mph or Kmph.  This is set from a drop down box at
        the <b>Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</b> menu of the main 
        PanelPro window</li>
        <li><b>Track Speed</b> of the train.  A correlation of 
          the throttle settings to the actual speed
          of the train on the layout must be known. For this 
          two methods are used.
          <ul>
            <li>
            A first approximation is the <b>"Throttle Setting/Speed Factor"</b>
            value at Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants.
            When used, this factor is a linear multiplier to relate throttle
            setting to track speed.  <b>Note</b> this is a global value for 
            all of the locomotives in your fleet and over the entire speed
            range of each.  Obviously this may not function optimally.
            However, it could be satisfactory for your tastes.</li>
            <li> 
            For more precision a <b>Speed Profile</b> can be used for each
            locomotive. These provide track speed values that give more  
            accurate calculations for time and distances.  
            The Speed Profiler
            is found at <b>Roster-&gt;Speed Profiling</b> is used to
            create a speed profilr for each locomotive or consist.</li>  
          </ul>
        </li> 
      </ul>

      <h3>Getting Speed Profiles for your Trains</h3>
      <p>Speed Profiles are
      maintained in the Roster and there is a tool that will create
      them at <b>Roster-&gt;Speed Profiling</b> The tool can
      measure a track speed for each step in the throttle.
      However, interpolation and extrapolation have been implemented
      so it is not necessary to go to such detail.  Five or
      six data points well distributed over the throttle's
      range is quite sufficient.</p>

      <a name="autoSpeedProfile" id="autoSpeedProfile"></a>
      <h2>Automatic Speed Profiling</h2>
      <p>Since <b><i>Release 4.9.2</i></b>
      track speed of an engine/consist is measured when that address
      is used for running a Warrant. A data point is recorded whenever
      a path with known length is traversed with a known throttle
      setting. The data is kept for the layout
      session and when the session ends this Session Speed Profile 
      can be merged into the Roster Speed Profile.  Warrant Preferences
      provides choices for how you may want to manage the merging of
      Roster Speed Profiles. See <a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Warrants">Warrant
      Preferences</a> for how you want to manage the end of session
      behavior.  The default is you are prompted for how you want
      to treat each Session Speed Profile.</p>
      
      <h3>Track Speeds for Throttle Settings</h3>
      <p>If you used the Roster Speed Profiling tool most likely you ran
      an engine running light over a straight level track. With 
      Warrant dynamic speed profiling, measurements are made over
      straight level track, but also upgrade, down grade, curved
      gently or severely, running light or pulling 30+ cars. 
      <i>The track speeds are not going to be all the same for a
      given throttle setting.</i>  When merging, new values are 
      averaged with the old, with the intention of a composite
      speed profile that reflects average use.</p>
       
      <p>At some point, merging this data
      may make a speed profile that is not monotonic increasing.
      (Certainly increasing throttle setting increases speed). When
      this anomaly occurs the speed profile is displayed and the
      cells where the profile is not monotonic are marked in red.
      You may edit the table to correct it. Whether to do this
      editing is your choice.  Perhaps it is best to let the
      anomalies remain and have the profile resolve itself - or
      do the editing after letting more values accumulate.
      Of course, a value resulting when the train was shorted
      or was dragging a derailed car should be deleted.</p>
      
      <h4>Editing a Speed Profile</h4>
      <p>When given the opportunity to edit, either the value of
      a single cell can be changed or an entire row deleted.
      Replacing a value with 0.0, causes that speed step to be
      ignored. When a track speed is needed for a throttle setting
      there, an interpolated value is used.  If
      values in both directions are 0.0, the row might as
      well be deleted.</p>

      <h2>Aspect Speed Table and its Interpretation</h2>
      <p>Speeds are
      named in the aspects.xml files that signal masts use in the
      Signal Mast System. These speed names are also used in the
      Blocks tables. To control train speed, values must be
      assigned to these speed names. The Aspect Speed Map found at
      <i>&gt;Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</i> provides a value
      for each named speed. It is up to the user to assign a value
      to the name and a meaning to the value. On the Warrant
      Preferences Pane are four radio buttons to assign meaning
      to the values entered into the Speed Map Table.</p>

      <p>When a signal or block defines an aspect speed by name,
      the warrant looks up the name in the Aspect Speed Table
      and uses the value there tp modify the speed of the train.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Percent of Normal</b> - The value is a percentage of
          the recorded ("Normal") speed. <i>Any speed name that is
          restrictive must have a values less than 100.</i>  The
          warrant reduces the "Normal" scripted speed by this
          value as a percentage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Percent of Full Throttle</b> - The value is an
          absolute throttle setting expressed as a percentage of
          full throttle. <i>All speed names must be a number 
          between 0 and 100.</i> The warrant sets the modified speed
          to be the value as a percentage of the full throttle
          setting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Miles per hour</b> - The value is the scale speed
          expressed as miles per hour. <i>All speed names must
          be expressed as miles per hour.</i> The warrant, using
          layout scale, converts the value to track speed and
          finds the corresponding throttle setting for the
          modified speed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Kilometers per Hour</b> - The value is the scale
          speed expressed as Kilometers per hour. <i>All speed 
          names must be expressed as kilometers per hour.</i> 
          The warrant, using layout scale,
          converts the value to track speed and finds the
          corresponding throttle setting for the
          modified speed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To sum up; if you are not fussy about being prototypical
      and always want to see speed change when signals are passed,
      use "Percent of Normal". If you have calibrated a sufficient
      Speed Profile for each of your engines you can use either of
      the last two speed interpretations which express throttle
      setting in terms of scale speed.</p>

      <h3>The Signal Head Appearance Table</h3>
      <p>If signal heads are
      used on the layout, their appearances can be mapped to the
      speed names of signal masts in this table on the Warrant
      Preferences pane. For the above, the warrant maps
      appearance name to speed name to value.</p>

      <p>One use of this is to use Virtual Signal Heads to
      dynamically influence the behavior of warrants. The
      appearance of these Signal Heads can be set either by panel icons
      or Logix. Since there are 8 possible Signal Head appearances,
      additional speed names can be created so a unique speed can
      be made for each appearance.</p>

      <h3>Editing the Speed Map Table</h3>
      <p>Rows can be added or
      deleted. The default speed map has the names "Fifty" and
      "Sixty". These names only appear in signal mast systems for
      UP-2008 and BNSF-1996, so they can safely be deleted if you
      do use these signal systems. You only need but <i>must
      have</i> all the speed names that appear in the signal system
      you have configured for your layout.</p>

      <p>If you add a new speed name for a signal head appearance,
      then add a row for that name in the Signal Map Table.</p>

      <h2>Block Speed Names</h2>
      <p>A speed name can be set for each
      Block by selecting a name from the <b>Speed Notch</b> column
      of the OBlock Table. One use of this feature could be to
      enforce a yard limit speed. Unlike signal speed names, block
      speed names are bi-directional. <b>NOTE:</b> To return a Warrant's speed
      to normal when leaving a yard limit, the speed names of the
      OBlocks on either side of the yard block should set to
      "Normal". Use care when combining this feature with signals
      to avoid providing conflicting speed change messages.</p>

      <p>To unset an OBlock speed name, choose the blank setting
      from the <b>Speed Limit</b> column. As with the absence of a
      signal, when there is no speed name the Warrant continues at
      its current speed.</p>
