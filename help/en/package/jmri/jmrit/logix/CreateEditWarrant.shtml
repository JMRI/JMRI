      <h1>Creating and Editing Warrants</h1>
      A Warrant contains the information needed to run a train. This includes the DCC address of
      the locomotive or consist, the turnout settings of the paths through the blocks of the route
      and the throttle commands to use at various points along the route. Among these are speed
      changes, when to show lights, sound horns, bells or other sound effects. For an overview
      discussion of Warrants, see <a href="Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>.
      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Warrants can only be created if the PanelPro configuration has at
        least two OBlocks defined.
      </div>

      <p>There are three steps in creating a Warrant:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Define the route</li>

        <li>Select a train, and</li>

        <li>Record the throttle commands.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>When a <strong>Create Warrant</strong> menu is selected, a window to define the warrant is
      displayed. At the top, you may enter a System Name and a User Name. After the warrant is
      saved by pressing the <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the window, the System
      name cannot be changed. The User Name may be changed anytime the warrant is edited.</p>
      <a href="images/WarrantCreate1.png"><img src="images/WarrantCreate1.png" width="897" height=
      "433" alt="Create Warrant pane part 1 in JMRI 4.10"></a>
      <h2>Defining a Warrant Route</h2>
      Routes are created using the <strong>Define Route</strong> tab in the Edit Warrant pane.
      <h3>Origin, Destination, Via and Avoid Blocks</h3>
      The <strong>Origin Block</strong> is where a train given this route will start and the
      starting path within the origin block is the track it is on - e.g. a path named "Departure
      Track #3" in block named "Main Terminal". Choosing the portal of the path, e.g. portal "West
      Approach to #3" where the train should exit the origin block determines the direction of the
      train on the route. A computer algorithm will find portals, paths and blocks needed to take
      the train to the Destination Block and path - e.g. "Arrival Track #1" in the destination
      block.
      <p>After selecting the block and path where the train will begin its trip and the portal by
      which it should leave and similarly the block, path and entry portal where the train should
      end its trip, pressing the <strong>Calculate Route</strong> button will determine all the
      intermediate paths needed to make the trip.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The right hand portion of the Create Warrant window is a table
        listing all the OBlocks you have defined. Either the System Name or the User Name of a
        Block can be dragged and dropped into the Location Block fields on the left hand side of
        the pane. Alternatively, you can mouse click on an Indicator Track icon of the block in the
        layout diagram and it will be selected for the location.
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Originating Location</strong>: - Consists of a text field for the originating
          <strong>Block Name</strong>, a drop down menu to choose the starting <strong>Path
          Name</strong> and a drop down menu to select the <strong>Exit Portal Name</strong>.
          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            The block may have several paths and the default path showing may not be the one where
            you intend the train to start. Also, Since paths usually have two portals, the exit
            portal showing may not be the one the train should pass through when leaving the origin
            block.
          </div>
          Setting the Exit Portal determines the direction the train will take. There is no further
          need to specify direction, since the algorithm will only provide routes that leave in
          that direction.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Destination Location</strong>: - Consists of a text field for the destination
          <strong>Block Name</strong> and a drop down menu for the terminating <strong>Path
          Name</strong> and a drop down menu to select the <strong>Entry Portal Name</strong>.
          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            As above the block may have several paths and the path where you intend the train to
            finish its run needs to be specified. It is important to specify the Entry portal for
            the destination. This is needed when the layout has reversing loops allowing the path
            to be entered from either end.<br>
            <em>A common mistake where no route will be found is to specify an <strong>Entry
            Portal</strong> or <strong>Path</strong> that cannot be reached by the direction taken
            when leaving the origin OBlock.</em>
          </div>

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <strong>Note:</strong> when a Path is chosen, only the Portals of that Path are shown
            in the Exit or Entry Portal drop down menus. Thus, even though the block may have many
            Portals, you will only see at most two portals.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Via Location</strong>: - Consists of a text field for a <strong>Block
        Name</strong> and a drop down menu for the <strong>Path Name</strong> where you want the
        route to pass through.<br>
        Typically, it is not necessary to enter any block name in this field, since it is likely
        the algorithm will detect the route you want. This entry is used when there are many routes
        possible from origin to destination and you want only to consider routes passing through a
        particular path on this block.</li>

        <li><strong>Avoid Location</strong>: - Consists of a text field for a <strong>Block
        Name</strong> and a drop down menu for the <strong>Path Name</strong> that you do not want
        the route to use.<br>
        This entry is used when there are many routes possible from origin to destination and you
        want only to consider routes that do not pass through a particular path on this block.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">More information about <strong>OBlocks</strong>,
        <strong>Portals</strong> and <strong>OPaths</strong> can be found at <a href=
        "OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block Tables</a>.
          <h3>Calculate and Debug</h3>
          After the origin and destination blocks and paths have been chosen, press the
          <strong>Calculate Route</strong> button. The "Searching for Route" text box will show
          some statistics on the number of routes and their length in blocks that have been found
          while searching for routes. The text field "Max Number of Blocks in Route" limits how far
          the computer will look routes. The <strong>Stop</strong> button will terminate the search
          for routes.
          <p>After the Stop button is pressed or the computer exhausts all the possible routes less
          than or equal the "max length", it presents a list of the routes that it found and their
          lengths. Choose a route by pressing its radio button. Pressing the
          <strong>Review</strong> button will display the route for you to examine in a Train Route
          Table. Each block, its path and portals used to traverse the route is displayed. Also you
          can view the route on the PanelPro layout diagram if the track icons are <em>Indicator
          Track,</em> icons.<br>
          <a href="images/RouteList.png"><img src="images/RouteList.png" width="689" height="249"
          alt="the Route list"></a></p>

          <p>You may inspect all the routes in this manner. Choosing a route and pressing the
          <strong>Select</strong> button will dismiss the dialog. and bring up the
          <strong>Record/Playback Script</strong> tab. If exactly one route is found, the list
          dialog is skipped.</p>

          <p>Frequently, more than one route will be found and the list may be quite long -
          especially when the route is a repeating loop. If the list is too lengthy, there are
          several ways you can restrict the number of routes found.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Specify a maximum number of blocks to use in a route by entering a smaller number
            in the <strong>Max Number of Blocks in Route</strong> box. The computer will only list
            routes with this number or fewer blocks</li>

            <li>Specify an intermediate <strong>Via Location</strong> block and path that must be
            included in the route. The computer will calculate the route with this "must include"
            restriction and present you only with routes through the specified "Via" block and
            path.</li>

            <li>Specify an <strong>Avoid Location</strong> block and path that must not be in the
            route. The computer will not list any routes containing this "must avoid" block and
            path</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Sometimes the dialog message "No Route found from "Origin Block', path ..." etc. is
          displayed. Responding <strong>Yes</strong> to the question, "Show the search tree?" will
          open a window with a graphic description of all paths beginning at the Origin block, path
          and exit portal. Trace what you believe to be a likely route by clicking on the nodes.
          Each node is a block path and will display its path and block name and the entry and exit
          portals it uses. At the end of each branch, the leaf node will be the point where the
          route could not continue. Normally these leaves are spurs. However, these are also the
          places where you may find an error or omission that you made when defining the OBlocks,
          OPaths and Portals. As you trace the attempted routes you may find that you have
          forgotten to enter a path or mis-labeled the correct portal to a path. <em>A common
          mistake is to incorrectly specify the path or portal that must be used to leave the
          starting block or to enter the destination block.</em></p>

          <p>Another possible reason is the search depth was reached before the route can be
          completed. In this case, increase the maximum number of blocks to use in a route by
          entering a larger number in the <strong>Max Number of Blocks in Route</strong> box.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creating the Throttle Command Script</h2>
      When you are satisfied with the route and have selected it, the <strong>Record/Playback
      Script</strong> tab will be displayed for you:<br>
      <a href="images/WarrantCreate2.png"><img src="images/WarrantCreate2.png" width="897" height=
      "433" alt="Create Warrant pane part 2 in in JMRI 4.10"></a><br>
      The route is shown in a table. For each OBlock. the entry portal, path and exit portal are
      displayed.
      <p>The bottom half displays six outlined areas; <strong>Choose Engine Consist</strong>,
      <strong>Select Type</strong>, <strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>Learn mode</strong>,
      <strong>Run Parameters,</strong> and <strong>Test Run Train</strong>. More about the use of
      these areas will be discussed below.<br>
      The first thing to do is to choose an engine to power your train.</p>

      <h3>Choosing a Train</h3>
      The <strong>Train Name</strong> field is used to provide a name that can be displayed by an
      indicator track icon as the train travels along the warrant route. If you have defined an
      JMRI engine roster, the train names are displayed in the <strong>Engine Roster</strong> drop
      down ComboBox. Selecting a name from this list will fill in the <strong>Address</strong> text
      field and assigns the engine to power the warrant.
      <p>Alternatively a DCC address can be typed into the <strong>Address</strong> text field and
      it will be used whether or not it is found in the JMRI Engine Roster. Chose or enter the
      address of the train positioned on the "Origin" block of the route.</p>

      <h2>Learn Mode</h2>
      Throttle commands are created by recording the commands you send to a train while operating
      it manually from a throttle in <strong>Learn Mode</strong>. The <strong>Prototypical</strong>
      button must be chosen from the <strong>Warrant Types</strong> box.
      <h3>Learn Mode Throttle</h3>
      If a train has been assigned, that is, has a valid DCC address in the warrant, then a
      throttle can be acquired by pressing the <strong>Start</strong> button. A screen throttle
      will be displayed. This throttle will operate the acquired train and all the throttle
      commands will be recorded until the <strong>Stop</strong> button is pressed. It can be
      inconvenient to use the computer screen Learn Mode throttle. Under LocoNet a handheld
      throttle may "steal" the screen throttle address and its commands will be recorded. For all
      other systems a walkaround WiFi throttle can be used to "steal" and record commands. Whatever
      throttle is used, start and stop the recording with the buttons in the <strong>Learn
      Mode</strong> box.
      <p>Be sure that the train is located on the path of the Origin block of the route and note
      the direction of you intend the train to take. If needed, the first command you make on the
      learn throttle should be the engine direction toward the exit portal of the Origin block.</p>

      <p>The learn script should be done with a completely clear route - All turnouts should be set
      for the route, all blocks unoccupied (except the origin), all signals should be set for clear
      running and no changes made during the recording period. The recorded speeds and elapsed
      times should be for unrestricted "Normal" speeds. Once the <strong>Start</strong> button is
      pressed and recording has begun, the Route Pane is replaced by the Throttle Commands
      Pane.<br>
      <a href="images/WarrantCreate3.png"><img src="images/WarrantCreate3.png" width="897" height=
      "433" alt="the Throttle Commands Pane"></a></p>

      <p>In normal operation, when the script is played back, the train will follow the commands as
      recorded. However if a track condition ahead of it is detected that requires a speed change,
      the warrant will modify the recorded speed accordingly. When the warrant makes such a speed
      change it "ramps" the change in small steps to give a more prototypical smooth look to the
      change. When decreasing speed it calculates and issues these step-wise speed changes so that
      the required speed is achieved just at the point where the speed limit must be enforced. When
      increasing speed it begins a similar "ramp up" when entering the block permitting the speed
      increase. <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">Warrant Speed Changes</a> has details about how
      warrants modify recorded speeds.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The train should <strong><em>not</em></strong> be moving when the
      recording is stopped. <em>When play back of the warrant ends, the train might continue to run
      without a warrant to control it!</em> After recording a script, check the ending throttle
      commands to see that the speed is set to 0.0</p>

      <p>When the route has been traversed and all throttle commands are done, recording is
      completed by pressing the <strong>Stop</strong> button. After this, the throttle commands can
      be edited and additional run parameters set.</p>

      <h3>What the Warrant Does on Playback.</h3>
      The script records the elapsed times traversing each occupancy block and knows when to expect
      the train to enter each block.
      <p>The throttle commands of the next block will be delayed until the train enters the block.
      That is, the elapsed time of the NoOp command must be reached before any more commands are
      issued to the running train. This will be the case if the train is late in arriving at the
      block. On the other hand if the train arrives earlier than expected the remaining commands of
      the preceding block are executed in fractions of a second to catch up.</p>

      <p>The warrant sends commands to the addressed engine in the order they were recorded with
      the same number of elapsed milliseconds between them. In spite of an exact repeat of the
      recorded throttle settings, the track speed and position of the train may not be at the same
      place as they were when it was recorded. Changing the consist of the train or even a
      temperature change between recording and playback, may result in the train not performing a
      throttle command at exactly the same place on the on the route where it was recorded.</p>

      <p>If a more precise way is needed to have a script event occur at a particular location, see
      the section <strong>Triggering External Events From Scripts</strong> below.</p>

      <h2>Editing and Running the Warrant Script</h2>
      Warrant scripts can be tested and modified prior to saving them.
      <h3>Test Running</h3>

      <p>After a script is recorded, reset the train to the Origin block and press the
      <strong>AutoRun</strong> button in the <strong>Test Run Train</strong> box. This sends the
      throttle commands to the train specified in the warrant.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Test Run Train</strong> box has four radio buttons to control the train and
      override the Throttle commands.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Halt</strong> Stop the train.</li>

        <li><strong>Resume</strong> Ramp the speed up to its previous speed.</li>

        <li><strong>Emergency Stop</strong> Issue an Emergency Stop to the train.</li>

        <li><strong>Abort</strong> Stop the train and null the warrant.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Name and save the warrant when you are satisfied by its performance by pressing the
      <strong>Save</strong> button. This adds the warrant to the <a href=
      "WarrantTable.shtml">Warrant Table</a> and closes the Create/Edit Warrant window.</p>

      <h3>Run Parameters</h3>
      This area has check boxes to modify how the train will operate when running the Warrant for a
      particular instance.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clearance to Share Route</strong> - Normally a track warrant assigns exclusive
        rights to only one train. This option allows several trains to share rights to a route,
        such as train sections following one another. Multiple "shared warrants" are still subject
        to ramping speed changes due to signals or rogue occupancy.</li>

        <li><strong>Add Tracker after run completes</strong> - Upon completion of the warrant
        script, the movement of the train by a manual operator can be tracked.</li>

        <li><strong>Don't Ramp Speed Changes</strong> - Suppress the ramping calculations. Instead,
        the Warrant makes immediate speed change upon entering the approach block to the block
        requiring a speed change. <span class="since">since 4.5.7</span></li>

        <li><strong>Use Elapsed Time Only</strong> - Do not use block detection. <em>Using this
        option allows Warrants to be run on layouts without block detection.</em></li>
      </ul>
      Using the "Don't Ramp" or "Elapsed Time" options are the only cases where block path lengths
      and engine speed factors are <em>not</em> necessary.
      <h3>Changing Engine Consist</h3>
      The warrant can be edited to use a different engine. A different engine may have different
      speed characteristics. If the engine has a Speed Profile, it can be viewed.
      <p>The <strong>View Speed Profile</strong> button displays a table of the track speeds
      corresponding to the throttle settings for the addressed locomotive or consist. The speed
      units can be changed to scale speed.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <strong>Note:</strong> A value of "0.000" <strong>does not</strong> mean zero speed. It
        means there is no track speed for that throttle setting.
      </div>

      <h2>Editing the Throttle Command Table</h2>
      The Throttle Command Table has the following columns:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ET (msec)</strong>: - The elapsed time in milliseconds to wait before issuing
        the throttle command.</li>

        <li><strong>Command</strong>: - The throttle command that was recorded (direction, speed,
        or button press or release). The command can be edited by choosing an item from the drop
        down combo box.</li>

        <li><strong>Value</strong>: - The value of the command. Chose a value from the drop down
        combo box. the choices are dependent on the command being edited.</li>

        <li><strong>Block or Sensor Name</strong>: - The block the train occupied when the throttle
        command was recorded. If the command being edited is <strong>Set Sensor</strong> or
        <strong>Wait Sensor</strong> then the name of the sensor should be entered. If the command
        is <strong>Run Warrant</strong> then the name of the warrant should be entered</li>

        <li><strong>Track or Scale Speed</strong> - The track speed of the warranted train
        calculated from the throttle setting and the Speed Profile of engine consist.</li>
      </ul>
      The recorded throttle commands execute according to the elapsed time between commands. The
      entry into each block is recorded with a "NoOp" marker. These markers are used to synchronize
      the elapsed time of the automatic running of the train when it enters a block. This reset is
      done so events recorded in the block occur according to the elapsed time in the block.
      <h3>Editing Recorded Throttle Commands</h3>
      Most of the columns in the Throttle Command Table can be edited. Perhaps you want to touch up
      the timing for the horn blasts or modify the speeds. Just enter the data you want. Other
      values in the Throttle Command Table are changed by selecting an item from the cell's drop
      down combo box.
      <p>Rows may be inserted or deleted from the table using the <strong>Insert</strong> and
      <strong>Delete</strong> buttons to the right of the table. Note that an inserted row has 0
      elapsed time from the previous command so you may want to adjust this by taking time away
      from either the previous row or the following row and entering it into the inserted row.
      Also, when a row is deleted, its elapsed time is added to the time of the following row.
      These default elapsed times for inserting and deleting rows are entered to keep the total
      elapsed time in the block constant.</p>

      <p>Some caution should be taken to only make modest changes since new commands when executed
      in playback could cause dramatic events. It may be wiser to re-record the commands in a new
      Learn Mode session if major changes are made.</p>

      <h3>Track Speeds</h3>
      Recording the track speeds in the <strong>Speed</strong> column was added in <em>Release
      4.9.2</em>. On playback, if possible, the warrant uses track speed to make the throttle
      setting. For this to be done, a speed profile is needed for the locomotive/consist running
      the warrant. The feature helps compensate for changes in the size of the train or different
      address of the power, by attempting to produce the same track speed. Lacking a speed profile,
      the recorded throttle setting is used. In <em>Release 4.9.4</em> the scripted throttle
      setting is not modified by the track speed. (i.e. the above is a 4.9.2 feature only)
      <p>On the right of the Throttle Command table is a button labeled <strong>Track
      Speed</strong> or <strong>Scale speed</strong>. Pressing the button will display the last
      column of the Throttle Command table (estimated layout speed of throttle setting) in terms of
      one of four kinds of units - millimeters per second, inches per second track speed or miles
      per hour, kilometers per Hour scale speed.</p>

      <p>The DCC address used in the recording is the "standard power" of the warrant. To base the
      track speeds on a different address or roster entry, select that entry and press the
      <strong>track/scale speed</strong> button. Warrants recorded before Release 4.9.2 can be
      upgraded this way.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <strong>NOTE:</strong>Recording track speeds in warrants makes panels saved with Release
        4.9.2 fail to load with earlier versions of JMRI. However, Recorded track speeds can be set
        to "0.000" by selecting no address or roster entry then pressing <strong>Add
        Speeds</strong>. Saving the panel now will allow it to be loaded by earlier versions.
      </div>

      <h2>Triggering External Events From Scripts</h2>
      External animation or other events may be triggered by the "<strong>Set Sensor</strong>"
      command. To do this insert a row, then select <strong>Set Sensor</strong> from the list of
      items under the <strong><em>Command</em></strong> column. Next select the action
      (<strong>active</strong> or <strong>inactive</strong>) you want from the
      <strong>Value</strong> column. Lastly, enter a sensor name in the <strong>Block or
      Sensor</strong> column. Also enter or adjust the elapsed time when to trigger the setting of
      the sensor. On playback when this command is executed the state of the sensor will be set.
      <h3>Script Synchronization With External Events</h3>
      Additional synchronization can be done within a block. For example stopping a train at a
      water tower or over an uncoupling device or for any reason where using the elapsed time of a
      command is not precise enough. To do this, there is a <strong>Wait Sensor</strong> command.
      Insert a row and follow the same procedure as was done with set Sensor. On playback when this
      command is executed the script is suspended and the current movement of the train is
      sustained until the sensor changes to the specified state. When that happens the script
      continues to execute according to the recorded times.
      <p>For example the "Wait Sensor" might be an optical sensor named "sStopTrain" positioned to
      detect specific point. The "Wait Sensor" command is bracketed with speed commands, the one
      before with a very slow speed and the one after with speed 0. Sensor "sStopTrain" is set
      inactive and then the script is set to wait until it goes active. The script will then have
      the train creep at the current slow speed of 11.4 mm/sec until the sensor detects the trains
      desired position. Then the script continues to set speed to 0, which stops the train.
      Following that, the scrip must wait for another sensor named "sStartTrain" to go active
      before it can continue.<br>

      The script and train will stay stopped until the second "Wait Sensor" command triggered from
      an external event allows the script to continue.</p>

      <h3>Automatic Sequencing of Warrants</h3>
      <span class="since">since 3.11.1</span>
      <p>It is possible to start another script from a script. To do this, insert a row and select
      the <strong>Run Warrant</strong> in the <strong><em>Command</em></strong> column. Enter the
      name of a warrant in the <strong><em>Block or Sensor</em></strong> column. This command
      launches the second warrant. Note that a train with the address specified in the second
      warrant <strong>must be present</strong> in the starting block of the second warrant.
      Otherwise, the second train will start running in uncontrolled places.</p>

      <p>This feature can be used to loop a train repeatedly by using the same warrant name. If a
      script terminates with the destination block equal to the origin block, it will repeat for
      the number of times entered into the <strong><em>Value</em></strong> column. If a negative
      number is entered the script will repeat indefinitely until an abort command is manually
      issued. Another possibility would be to use warrant "from A to B" and warrant "from B to A",
      where warrant "from A to B" runs warrant "from B to A" and warrant "from B to A" runs warrant
      "from A to B" and each Warrant specifies the same train ID and the same number of
      repeats.</p>

      <h2>Running Trains on Dark Blocks</h2>
      The Learn mode and Run Mode functions can be used on blocks that do not have detection
      sensors. However, without detection, other than the initial setting of turnouts, the warrant
      cannot reset the turnouts or modify its speed while the train is <em>en route</em>. This
      means there is no protection from rogue trains fouling the route or from turnouts being
      changed while the train is <em>en route</em>. Therefore, run trains with caution over Dark
      Blocks.
      <p>Note that entry into a Dark Block is detected differently than an Occupancy Block.
      Obviously, entry into an occupancy Block is recorded when the occupancy block detects
      occupancy. However entry into a Dark Block can only be recorded when the previous occupancy
      Block shows no occupancy. That is, the elapsed time for entry into a Dark Block is recorded
      by the tail of the train entered the dark, not the head.</p>

      <h2>Save etc.</h2>
      At the bottom of the Create Warrant pane the <strong>Status</strong> field displays messages
      when doing test runs from the <strong>AutoRun</strong> button. Below that are three buttons
      that let you:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Save</strong>: - Saves the warrant so it can be shown in the list of warrants
        on the Warrant Table. A permanent copy of the warrant is saved when the panel is saved to
        the Configuration file.</li>

        <li><strong>Copy</strong>: - Makes a copy of the warrant.</li>

        <li><strong>Cancel</strong>: - Cancels any editing that may have been done.</li>
      </ul>
