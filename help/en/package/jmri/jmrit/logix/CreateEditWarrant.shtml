      <h1>Creating and Editing Warrants</h1>

      A Warrant contains the
      information needed to run a train. This includes the DCC
      address of the locomotive or consist, the turnout settings
      of the paths through the blocks of the route and the
      throttle commands to use at various points along the route.
      Among these are speed changes, when to show lights,
      sound horns, bells or other
      sound effects. For an overview discussion of Warrants, see
      <a href="Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>.

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <b>NOTE:</b> Warrants can only be created if the PanelPro
        configuration has at least two OBlocks defined.
      </div>

      <p>There are three steps in creating a Warrant:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Define the route</li>
            <li>Select a train, and</li>
            <li>Record the throttle commands.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>When a <b>Create Warrant</b> menu is selected, a window to
      define the warrant is displayed. At the top, you may enter
      a System Name and a User Name. After the warrant is saved by
      pressing the <b>Save</b> button at the bottom of the window,
      the System name cannot be changed.  The User Name may be changed
      anytime the warrant is edited.</p>

      <h2>Defining a Warrant Route</h2>
      Routes are created using the
      <b>Define Route</b> tab in the Edit Warrant pane.

      <h3>Origin, Destination, Via and Avoid Blocks</h3>
      The <b>Origin Block</b> is where a train given this route
      will start
      and the starting path within the origin block is the track it
      is on - e.g. a path named "Departure Track #3" in block named
      "Main Terminal". Choosing the portal of the path, e.g. portal
      "West Approach to #3" where the train should exit the origin
      block determines the direction of the train on the route. A
      computer algorithm will find portals, paths and blocks needed
      to take the train to the Destination Block and path - e.g.
        "Arrival Track #1" in the destination block.

      <p>After selecting the block and
      path where the train will begin its trip and the portal by
      which it should leave and similarly the block, path and
      entry portal where the train should end its trip, pressing
      the <b>Calculate Route</b> button will
      determine all the intermediate paths needed to make the
      trip.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <b>Note:</b> The right hand portion of the
        Create Warrant window is a table listing all the
        OBlocks you have defined. Either the System Name or the
        User Name of a Block can be dragged and dropped into the
        Location Block fields on the left hand side of the pane.
        Alternatively, you can mouse click on an Indicator Track
        icon of the block in the layout diagram and it will be
        selected for the location.
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Originating Location</b>: - Consists of a text field
          for the originating <b>Block Name</b>, a drop down menu
          to choose the starting <b>Path Name</b> and a drop down
          menu to select the <b>Exit Portal Name</b>.

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            The block may have several paths and the default path
            showing may not be the one where you intend the train
            to start. Also, Since paths usually have two portals,
            the exit portal showing may not be the one the train
            should pass through when leaving the origin block.
          </div>Setting the Exit Portal determines the direction
          the train will take. There is no further need to specify
          direction, since the algorithm will only provide routes
          that leave in that direction.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Destination Location</b>: - Consists of a text field
          for the destination <b>Block Name</b> and a drop down
          menu for the terminating <b>Path Name</b> and a drop down
          menu to select the <b>Entry Portal Name</b>.

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            As above the block may have several paths and the path
            where you intend the train to finish its run needs to
            be specified. It is important to specify the Entry
            portal for the destination. This is needed when the
            layout has reversing loops allowing the path to be
            entered from either end.<br>
            <i>A common mistake where no route will be found is to
            specify an <b>Entry Portal</b> or <b>Path</b> that
            cannot be reached by the direction taken when
            leaving the origin OBlock.</i>
          </div>

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <b>Note:</b> when a Path is chosen, only the Portals of
            that Path are shown in the Exit or Entry Portal drop
            down menus. Thus, even though the block may have many
            Portals, you will only see at most two portals.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li><b>Via Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for a
        <b>Block Name</b> and a drop down menu for the <b>Path
        Name</b> where you want the route to pass through.<br>
        Typically, it is not necessary to enter any block name in
        this field, since it is likely the algorithm will detect
        the route you want. This entry is used when there are many
        routes possible from origin to destination and you want
        only to consider routes passing through a particular path
        on this block.</li>

        <li><b>Avoid Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for a
        <b>Block Name</b> and a drop down menu for the <b>Path
        Name</b> that you do not want the route to use.<br>
        This entry is used when there are many routes possible from
        origin to destination and you want only to consider routes
        that do not pass through a particular path on this
        block.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">More information about
        <b>OBlocks</b>, <b>Portals</b> and <b>OPaths</b> can be
        found at <a href="OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block
        Tables</a>.

          <h3>Calculate and Debug</h3>After the origin and
          destination blocks and paths have been chosen, press the
          <b>Calculate Route</b> button. The "Searching for Route"
          text box will show some statistics on the number of
          routes and their length in blocks that have been found
          while searching for routes. The text field "Max Number of
          Blocks in Route" limits how far the computer will look
          routes. The <b>Stop</b> button will terminate the search
          for routes.

          <p>After the Stop button is pressed or the computer
          exhausts all the possible routes less than or equal the
          "max length", it presents a list of the routes that it
          found and their lengths. Choose a route by pressing its
          radio button. Pressing the <b>Review</b> button will
          display the route for you to examine in a Train Route Table.
          Each block, its path and portals used to traverse the route
          is displayed. Also you can view the route on the PanelPro layout
          diagram if the track icons are <i>Indicator Track,</i>
          icons.<br>
          <a href="images/RouteList.png"><img
          src="images/RouteList.png" width="689"
          height="249" alt="the Route list"></a></p>

          <p>You may inspect all the routes in this manner.
          Choosing a route and pressing the <b>Select</b> button
          will dismiss the dialog. and bring up the
          <b>Record/Playback Script</b> tab. If exactly one route
          is found, the list dialog is skipped.</p>

          <p>Frequently, more than one route will be found and the
          list may be quite long - especially when the route is a
          repeating loop. If the list is too lengthy, there are
          several ways you can restrict the number of routes
          found.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Specify a maximum number of blocks to use in a
            route by entering a smaller number in the <b>Max Number
            of Blocks in Route</b> box. The computer will only list
            routes with this number or fewer blocks</li>

            <li>Specify an intermediate <b>Via Location</b>
            block and path that must be included in the route. The
            computer will calculate the route with this "must
            include" restriction and present you only with routes
            through the specified "Via" block and path.</li>

            <li>Specify an <b>Avoid Location</b> block and path
            that must not be in the route. The computer will not
            list any routes containing this "must avoid" block and
            path</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Sometimes the dialog message "No Route found from
          "Origin Block', path ..." etc. is displayed. Responding
          <b>Yes</b> to the question, "Show the search tree?" will
          open a window with a graphic description of all paths
          beginning at the Origin block, path and exit portal.
          Trace what you believe to be a likely route by clicking
          on the nodes. Each node is a block path and will display
          its path and block name and the entry and exit portals it
          uses. At the end of each branch, the leaf node will be
          the point where the route could not continue. Normally
          these leaves are spurs. However, these are also the
          places where you may find an error or omission that you
          made when defining the OBlocks, OPaths and Portals. As
          you trace the attempted routes you may find that you have
          forgotten to enter a path or mis-labeled the correct
          portal to a path. <i>A common mistake is to incorrectly
          specify the path or portal that must be used to leave the
          starting block or to enter the destination block.</i></p>

          <p>Another possible reason is the search depth was
          reached before the route can be completed. In this case,
          increase the maximum number of blocks to use in a route
          by entering a larger number in the <b>Max Number of
          Blocks in Route</b> box.</p>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creating the Throttle Command Script</h2>
          When you are satisfied with the route and have selected it,
          the <b>Record/Playback Script</b> tab will be displayed for
          you:<br>
          <a href="images/WarrantCreate2.png"><img
          src="images/WarrantCreate2.png" width="897"
          height="433" alt="Create Warrant
          pane part 2 in in JMRI 4.10"></a>
          <br>
          The route is shown in a table. For each OBlock.
          the entry portal, path and exit portal are displayed.

          <p>The bottom half displays six
          outlined areas; <b>Choose Engine Consist</b>,
          <b>Select Type</b>, <b>Settings</b>,
          <b>Learn mode</b>, <b>Run Parameters,</b> and
          <b>Test Run Train</b>. More about the use of these areas
          will be discussed below.<br>
          The first thing to do
          is to choose an engine to power your train.

          <h3>Choosing a Train</h3>
          The <b>Train Name</b> field is
          used to provide a name that can be displayed by an
          indicator track icon as the train travels along the
          warrant route. If you have defined an JMRI engine roster,
          the train names are displayed in the <b>Engine Roster</b>
          drop down ComboBox. Selecting a name from this list will
          fill in the <b>Address</b> text field
          and assigns the engine to power the warrant.

          <p>Alternatively a DCC address can be typed into the
          <b>Address</b> text field and it
          will be used whether or not it is found in the JMRI
          Engine Roster. Chose or enter the
          address of the train positioned on the "Origin"
          block of the route.</p>

          <h2>Learn Mode</h2>Throttle commands are created by
          recording the commands you send to a train while
          operating it manually from a throttle in <b>Learn
          Mode</b>. The <b>Prototypical</b> button must be
          chosen from the <b>Warrant Types</b> box.

          <h3>Learn Mode Throttle</h3>If a train has been assigned,
          that is, has a valid DCC address in the warrant, then a
          throttle can be acquired by pressing the <b>Start</b>
          button. A screen throttle will be displayed. This
          throttle will operate the acquired train and all the
          throttle commands will be recorded until the <b>Stop</b>
          button is pressed. It can be inconvenient to use the computer
            screen Learn Mode throttle. Under LocoNet a handheld
            throttle may "steal" the screen throttle address and
            its commands will be recorded. For all other systems a
            walkaround WiFi throttle can be used to "steal" and record
            commands. Whatever throttle is used, start and stop the
            recording with the buttons in the <b>Learn Mode</b>
            box.

            <p>Be sure that the train is located on the path
            of the Origin block of the route and note the direction
            of you intend the train to take. If needed, the first
            command you make on the learn throttle should be the
            engine direction toward the exit portal of the Origin block.

          </p><p>The learn script should be done with a completely
          clear route - All turnouts should be set for the
          route, all blocks unoccupied (except the origin), all signals
          should be set for clear running and no changes made during
          the recording period. The recorded
          speeds and elapsed times should be for unrestricted
          "Normal" speeds.

          Once the <b>Start</b> button is pressed and
          recording has begun, the Route Pane is replaced by
          the Throttle Commands Pane.<br>
          <a href="images/WarrantCreate3.png"><img
          src="images/WarrantCreate3.png" width="897"
          height="433" alt="the Throttle Commands Pane"></a>

          	<p>In normal operation, when the script is played back,
          	the train will follow the commands as recorded.
			However if a track condition ahead of it is detected that
			requires a speed change, the warrant will modify the recorded
			speed accordingly.
			When the warrant makes such a speed change it "ramps" the change
			in small steps to give a more prototypical smooth look to
			the change.  When decreasing speed it calculates and issues
			these step-wise speed changes so that the required speed is
			achieved just at the point where the speed limit must be enforced.
			When increasing speed it begins a similar "ramp up" when entering
			the block permitting the speed increase.
           <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">Warrant Speed Changes</a> has details
           about how warrants modify recorded speeds.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> The train should <b><i>not</i></b> be moving
            when the recording is stopped. <i>When play back of the
            warrant ends, the train might continue to run without a
            warrant to control it!</i> After recording a script, check
            the ending throttle commands to see that the speed is set
            to 0.0
          </p>

          <p>When the route has been traversed and all throttle commands
          are done, recording is  completed by pressing
          the <b>Stop</b> button. After this, the throttle
          commands can be edited and additional run parameters set.</p>

          <h3>What the Warrant Does on Playback.</h3>
          The script records the elapsed times traversing each
          occupancy block and knows when to expect the train to
          enter each block.

          <p> The
          throttle commands of the next block will be delayed until
          the train enters the block. That is, the elapsed time of
          the NoOp command must be reached before any more commands
          are issued to the running train. This will be the case if
          the train is late in arriving at the block. On the other
          hand if the train arrives earlier than expected the
          remaining commands of the preceding block are executed in
          fractions of a second to catch up.</p>

          <p>The warrant sends commands to the addressed engine in the
          order they were recorded with the same number of elapsed
          milliseconds between them. In spite of an exact repeat of
          the recorded throttle settings, the track speed and
          position of the train may not be at the same place as
          they were when it was recorded.
          Changing the consist of the train or
          even a temperature change between recording and
          playback, may result in the train not performing a
          throttle command at exactly the same place on the on the
          route where it was recorded.</p>

          <p>If a more precise way is needed to have a script event
          occur at a particular location, see the section
          <b>Triggering External Events From Scripts</b>
          below.</p>

      <h2>Editing and Running the Warrant Script</h2>
           Warrant scripts can be tested and modified prior to saving them.

          <h3>Test Running</h3>
          <p>After a script is recorded, reset the train to the Origin
          block and press the <b>AutoRun</b> button in the
          <b>Test Run Train</b> box. This sends
          the throttle commands to the train specified in the
            warrant.</p>

          <p>The <b>Test Run Train</b> box has four radio buttons to
            control the train and override the Throttle commands.</p>

		    <ul>
			<li><b>Halt</b> Stop the train.</li>
			<li><b>Resume</b> Ramp the speed up to its previous speed.</li>
			<li><b>Emergency Stop</b> Issue an Emergency Stop to the train.</li>
			<li><b>Abort</b> Stop the train and null the warrant.</li>
			</ul>
		  <p>Name and save the warrant when you are satisfied by its
          performance by pressing the <b>Save</b>
          button. This adds the warrant to the <a href=
          "WarrantTable.shtml">Warrant Table</a> and closes the
          Create/Edit Warrant window.</p>

			<h3>Run Parameters</h3>
            This area has check boxes to modify how the train will operate
            when running the Warrant for a particular instance.
			<ul>
                <li><b>Clearance to Share Route</b> - Normally a track warrant
                assigns exclusive rights to only one train.  This option allows
                several trains to share rights to a route, such as train sections
                following one another. Multiple "shared warrants" are still
                subject to ramping speed changes due to signals or rogue
                occupancy.</li>
                <li><b>Add Tracker after run completes</b> - Upon completion of
                the warrant script, the movement of the train by a manual
                operator can be tracked.</li>
                <li><b>Don't Ramp Speed Changes</b> - Suppress the
                ramping calculations. Instead, the Warrant makes immediate speed
                change upon entering the approach block to the block requiring
                a speed change. <span class="since">since 4.5.7</span></li>
                <li><b>Use Elapsed Time Only</b> - Do not use
                block detection. <i>Using this option allows Warrants to
                be run on layouts without block detection.</i></li>
			</ul>
			Using the "Don't Ramp" or "Elapsed Time" options are the
			only cases where block path lengths and engine speed factors
            are <i>not</i> necessary.

		  <h3>Changing Engine Consist</h3>
		  The warrant can be edited to use a different engine. A different
		  engine may have different speed characteristics. If the engine
		  has a Speed Profile, it can be viewed.

          <p>The <b>View Speed Profile</b> button displays a table
          of the track speeds corresponding to the throttle settings
          for the addressed locomotive or consist. The speed
          units can be changed to scale speed.</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <b>Note:</b> A value of "0.000" <b>does not</b> mean
            zero speed. It means there is no track speed for that
            throttle setting.
          </div>

          <h2>Editing the Throttle Command Table</h2>
          The Throttle Command Table
          has the following columns:
          <ul>
            <li><b>ET (msec)</b>: - The elapsed time in
            milliseconds to wait before issuing the throttle
            command.</li>

            <li><b>Command</b>: - The throttle command that was
            recorded (direction, speed, or button press or
            release). The command can be edited by choosing an
            item from the drop down combo box.</li>

            <li><b>Value</b>: - The value of the command. Chose a
            value from the drop down combo box. the choices are
            dependent on the command being edited.</li>

            <li><b>Block or Sensor Name</b>: - The block the train occupied when
            the throttle command was recorded. If the command being edited
            is <b>Set Sensor</b> or <b>Wait Sensor</b> then the name
            of the sensor should be entered. If the command
            is <b>Run Warrant</b> then the name
            of the warrant should be entered</li>

            <li><b>Track or Scale Speed</b> - The track speed of the
            warranted train calculated from the throttle setting
            and the Speed Profile of engine consist.</li>
          </ul>
          The recorded throttle commands execute according to
          the elapsed time between commands. The entry into each
          block is recorded with a "NoOp"
          marker. These markers are used to synchronize the elapsed
          time of the automatic running of the train when it enters
          a block. This reset is done so events recorded in the block
          occur according to the elapsed time in the block.

          <h3>Editing Recorded Throttle Commands</h3>
          Most of the columns in
          the Throttle Command Table can be edited. Perhaps you
          want to touch up the timing for the horn blasts or modify
          the speeds. Just enter the data you want. Other values in
          the Throttle Command Table are changed by selecting an
          item from the cell's drop down combo box.

          <p>Rows may be inserted or deleted from the table using
          the <b>Insert</b> and <b>Delete</b> buttons to the right
          of the table. Note that an
          inserted row has 0 elapsed time from the previous command
          so you may want to adjust this by taking time away from
          either the previous row or the following row and entering
          it into the inserted row. Also, when a row is deleted,
          its elapsed time is added to the time of the following
          row. These default elapsed times for inserting and
          deleting rows are entered to keep the total elapsed time
          in the block constant.</p>

          <p>Some caution should be taken to only make modest
          changes since new commands when executed in playback
          could cause dramatic events. It may be wiser to re-record
          the commands in a new Learn Mode session if major changes
          are made.

          <h3>Track Speeds</h3>
          Recording the track speeds in the <b>Speed</b> column
          was added in <i>Release 4.9.2</i>.  On playback, if possible,
          the warrant uses track speed to make the throttle setting.
          For this to be done, a speed profile is needed for the
          locomotive/consist running the warrant.  The feature helps
          compensate for changes in the size of the train or
          different address of the power, by attempting to produce
          the same track speed. Lacking a speed profile, the recorded
          throttle setting is used.  In <i>Release 4.9.4</i> the
          scripted throttle setting is not modified by the track speed.
          (i.e. the above is a 4.9.2 feature only)

          <p>On the right of the Throttle Command table is a button
          labeled <b>Track Speed</b> or <b>Scale speed</b>. Pressing
          the button will display the last column of the Throttle
          Command table (estimated layout speed of throttle setting)
          in terms of one of four kinds of
          units - millimeters per second, inches per second track
          speed or miles per hour, kilometers per Hour scale speed.</p>

          <p>The DCC address used in the recording is the "standard
          power" of the warrant. To base the track speeds on a different
          address or roster entry, select that entry and press the
          <b>track/scale speed</b> button.  Warrants recorded before Release
          4.9.2 can be upgraded this way.</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <b>NOTE:</b>Recording track speeds in warrants makes
            panels saved with Release 4.9.2 fail to load with earlier
            versions of JMRI. However, Recorded track speeds can be
            set to "0.000" by selecting no address or roster entry
            then pressing <b>Add Speeds</b>.  Saving the panel now
            will allow it to be loaded by earlier versions.
          </div>

          <h2>Triggering External Events From Scripts</h2>External
          animation or other events may be triggered by the
          "<b>Set Sensor</b>" command. To do this insert a row,
          then select <b>Set Sensor</b> from the list of items
          under the
          <b><i>Command</i></b> column. Next select the action
           (<b>active</b> or <b>inactive</b>) you
          want from the <b>Value</b> column. Lastly, enter a sensor name in
          the <b>Block or Sensor</b> column.
          Also enter or adjust the elapsed time when to
          trigger the setting of the sensor. On playback when this
          command is executed the state of the sensor will be set.

          <h3>Script Synchronization With External Events</h3>
          Additional synchronization can be done within
          a block. For example stopping a train at a water tower or
          over an uncoupling device or for any reason where using
          the elapsed time of a command is not precise enough. To
          do this, there is a <b>Wait Sensor</b> command. Insert a
          row and follow the same procedure as was done with set Sensor.
          On playback when this
          command is executed the script is suspended and the current
          movement of the train is sustained until the sensor
          changes to the specified state. When that happens the
          script continues to execute according to the recorded
          times.

          <p>For example the "Wait Sensor" might be an optical
          sensor named "sStopTrain" positioned to detect specific point.
          The "Wait Sensor" command is bracketed
          with speed commands, the one before
          with a very slow speed and the one after with speed 0.
          Sensor "sStopTrain" is set inactive and then the script
          is set to wait until it goes active.
          The script will then have the train creep at the current
          slow speed of 11.4 mm/sec until the sensor detects the
          trains desired position. Then the
          script continues to set speed to 0, which stops the train.
          Following that, the scrip must wait for
          another sensor named "sStartTrain" to go active before it
          can continue.<br>

          <a href="images/WaitExample.png"><img
          src="images/WaitExample.png" width="875"
          height="217" alt="Wait Sensor Example"></a><br>

          The script and train will stay stopped until the
          second "Wait Sensor" command triggered from an
          external event allows the script to continue.</p>

          <h3>Automatic Sequencing of Warrants</h3>
          <span class="since">since 3.11.1</span>
          <p>It is possible to
          start another script from a script. To do this, insert a
          row and select the <b>Run Warrant</b> in the
          <b><i>Command</i></b> column. Enter the name of a warrant in the
          <b><i>Block or Sensor</i></b> column. This command launches the
          second warrant. Note that a train with the address
          specified in the second warrant <b>must be present</b> in the
          starting block of the second warrant. Otherwise, the
          second train will start running in uncontrolled places.</p>

          <p>This feature can be used to loop a train repeatedly by
          using the same warrant name. If a script terminates with
          the destination block equal to the origin block, it will
          repeat for the number of times entered into the
          <b><i>Value</i></b> column. If a negative number is
          entered the script will repeat indefinitely until an
          abort command is manually issued. Another possibility
          would be to use warrant "from A to B" and warrant "from B
          to A", where warrant "from A to B" runs warrant "from B
          to A" and warrant "from B to A" runs warrant "from A to
          B" and each Warrant specifies the same train ID and the
          same number of repeats.</p>


          <h2>Running Trains on Dark Blocks</h2>
          The Learn mode and
          Run Mode functions can be used on blocks that do not have
          detection sensors. However, without detection, other than
          the initial setting of turnouts, the warrant cannot reset
          the turnouts or modify its speed while the train is
          <em>en route</em>. This means there is no protection from
          rogue trains fouling the route or from turnouts being
          changed while the train is <em>en route</em>. Therefore,
          run trains with caution over Dark Blocks.

          <p>Note that entry into a Dark Block is detected
          differently than an Occupancy Block. Obviously, entry
          into an occupancy Block is recorded when the occupancy
          block detects occupancy. However entry into a Dark Block
          can only be recorded when the previous
          occupancy Block shows no occupancy. That is, the elapsed
          time for entry into a Dark Block is recorded by the tail
          of the train entered the dark, not the head.</p>

          <h2>Save etc.</h2>
          At the bottom of the Create Warrant pane the <b>Status</b>
          field displays messages when doing test runs from the
          <b>AutoRun</b> button. Below that are three
          buttons that let you:

          <ul>
            <li><b>Save</b>: - Saves the warrant so it can be shown
            in the list of warrants on the Warrant Table. A
            permanent copy of the warrant is saved when the panel
            is saved to the Configuration file.</li>

            <li><b>Copy</b>: - Makes a copy of the warrant.</li>

            <li><b>Cancel</b>: - Cancels any editing that may have
            been done.</li>
          </ul>
