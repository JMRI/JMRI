      <h1>Creating and Editing Warrants</h1>

      <p>A Warrant contains the
      information needed to run a train. This includes the DCC
      address of the locomotive(s), the route train will take, the
      settings of the turnouts to traverse the route and the
      throttle commands to use at various points along the route -
      e.g. speed, when to show lights, sound horns, bells or other
      sound effects. For an overview discussion of Warrants, see
      <a href="Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <b>NOTE:</b> Warrants can only be created if the PanelPro
        configuration has at least two OBlocks defined.
      </div>

      <p>There are three steps in creating a Warrant:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Define the route</li>
            <li>Select a train, and</li>
            <li>Record the throttle commands.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>On the Create/Edit pane are two tabs:
      <b>Define Route</b> and <b>Record/Playback Script</b>.</p>

      height="270" alt="Create Warrant pane part 1 in JMRI 4.10"></a>

      <h2>Defining a Warrant Route</h2>
      <p>Routes are created using the
      <b>Define Route</b> tab in the Edit Warrant pane.</p>

      <h3>Origin, Destination, Via and Avoid Blocks</h3>
      <p>The <b>Origin Block</b> is where a train given this route
      will start
      and the starting path within the origin block is the track it
      is on - e.g. a path named "Departure Track #3" in block named
      "Main Terminal". Choosing the portal of the path, e.g. portal
      "West Approach to #3" where the train should exit the origin
      block determines the direction of the train on the route. A
      computer algorithm will find portals, paths and blocks needed
      to take the train to the Destination Block and path - e.g.
        "Arrival Track #1" in the destination block.</p>

      <p>A Warrant route is created by selecting the block and
      path where the train will begin its trip and the portal by
      which it should leave. Then you select the block, path and
      entry portal where the train should end its trip. Press the
      <b>Calculate Route</b> button and the computer will
      determine all the intermediate paths needed to make the
      trip.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <b>Note:</b> The right hand portion of the
        Create/Edit Warrant pane is a table listing all the
        OBlocks you have defined. Either the System Name or the
        User Name of a Block can be dragged and dropped into the
        Location Block fields on the left hand side of the pane.
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Originating Location</b>: - Consists of a text field
          for the originating <b>Block Name</b>, a drop down menu
          to choose the starting <b>Path Name</b> and a drop down
          menu to select the <b>Exit Portal Name</b>.

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            The block may have several paths and the default path
            showing may not be the one where you intend the train
            to start. Also, Since paths usually have two portals,
            the exit portal showing may not be the one the train
            should pass through when leaving the origin block.
          </div>Setting the Exit Portal determines the direction
          the train will take. There is no further need to specify
          direction, since the algorithm will only provide routes
          that leave in that direction.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Destination Location</b>: - Consists of a text field
          for the destination <b>Block Name</b> and a drop down
          menu for the terminating <b>Path Name</b> and a drop down
          menu to select the <b>Entry Portal Name</b>.

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            As above the block may have several paths and the path
            where you intend the train to finish its run needs to
            be specified. It is important to specify the Entry
            portal for the destination. This is needed when the
            layout has reversing loops allowing the path to be
            entered from either end.<br>
            <i>A common mistake where no route will be found is to
            specify an <b>Entry Portal</b> or <b>Path</b> that
            cannot be reached by the direction taken when
            leaving the origin OBlock.</i>
          </div>

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <b>Note:</b> when a Path is chosen, only the Portals of
            that Path are shown in the Exit or Entry Portal drop
            down menus. Thus, even though the block may have many
            Portals, you will only see at most two portals.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li><b>Via Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for a
        <b>Block Name</b> and a drop down menu for the <b>Path
        Name</b> where you want the route to pass through.<br>
        Typically, it is not necessary to enter any block name in
        this field, since it is likely the algorithm will detect
        the route you want. This entry is used when there are many
        routes possible from origin to destination and you want
        only to consider routes passing through a particular path
        on this block.</li>

        <li><b>Avoid Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for a
        <b>Block Name</b> and a drop down menu for the <b>Path
        Name</b> that you do not want the route to use.<br>
        This entry is used when there are many routes possible from
        origin to destination and you want only to consider routes
        that do not pass through a particular path on this
        block.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">More information about
        <b>OBlocks</b>, <b>Portals</b> and <b>OPaths</b> can be
        found at <a href="OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block
        Tables</a>.

          <h3>Calculate and Debug</h3>After the origin and
          destination blocks and paths have been chosen, press the
          <b>Calculate Route</b> button. The "Searching for Route"
          text box will show some statistics on the number of
          routes and their length in blocks that have been found
          while searching for routes. The text field "Max Number of
          Blocks in Route" limits how far the computer will look
          routes. The <b>Stop</b> button will terminate the search
          for routes.

          <p>After the Stop button is pressed or the computer
          exhausts all the possible routes less than or equal the
          "max length", it presents a list of the routes that it
          found and their lengths. Choose a route by pressing its
          radio button. Pressing the <b>Review</b> button will
          display the route for you to examine in a Train Route Table.
          Each block, its path and portals used to traverse the route
          is displayed. Also you can view the route on the PanelPro layout
          diagram if the track icons consist of <i>Indicator Track,</i>
          icons.</p>

          <p>You may inspect all the routes in this manner.
          Choosing a route and pressing the <b>Select</b> button
          will dismiss the dialog. and bring up the
          <b>Record/Playback Script</b> tab. If exactly one route
          is found, the list dialog is skipped.</p>

          <p>Frequently, more than one route will be found and the
          list may be quite long - especially when the route is a
          repeating loop. If the list is too lengthy, there are
          several ways you can restrict the number of routes
          found.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Specify a maximum number of blocks to use in a
            route by entering a smaller number in the <b>Max Number
            of Blocks in Route</b> box. The computer will only list
            routes with this number or fewer blocks</li>

            <li>Specify an intermediate <b>Via Location</b>
            block and path that must be included in the route. The
            computer will calculate the route with this "must
            include" restriction and present you only with routes
            through the specified "Via" block and path.</li>

            <li>Specify an <b>Avoid Location</b> block and path
            that must not be in the route. The computer will not
            list any routes containing this "must avoid" block and
            path</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Sometimes the dialog message "No Route found from
          "Origin Block', path ..." etc. is displayed. Responding
          <b>Yes</b> to the question, "Show the search tree?" will
          open a window with a graphic description of all paths
          beginning at the Origin block, path and exit portal.
          Trace what you believe to be a likely route by clicking
          on the nodes. Each node is a block path and will display
          its path and block name and the entry and exit portals it
          uses. At the end of each branch, the leaf node will be
          the point where the route could not continue. Normally
          these leaves are spurs. However, these are also the
          places where you may find an error or omission that you
          made when defining the OBlocks, OPaths and Portals. As
          you trace the attempted routes you may find that you have
          forgotten to enter a path or mis-labeled the correct
          portal to a path. <i>A common mistake is to incorrectly
          specify the path or portal that must be used to leave the
          starting block or to enter the destination block.</i></p>

          <p>Another possible reason is the search depth was
          reached before the route can be completed. In this case,
          increase the maximum number of blocks to use in a route
          by entering a larger number in the <b>Max Number of
          Blocks in Route</b> box.</p>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creating the Throttle Command Script</h2>
          <p>When you are satisfied with the route, the
          <b>Record/Playback Script</b> tab will be selected for
          you:<br>
          <a href="images/WarrantCreate2.png"><img
          src="images/WarrantCreate2.png" width="704"
          height="270" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt="Create Warrant
          pane part 2 in in JMRI 4.10"></a>

          At the very top are
          two radio buttons which allow you to select either the
          <b>Route Table</b> or the <b>Throttle Command Table</b>.
          The Route Table shows the track circuits (OBlock, Portals
          and Paths) the warrant defines. The Throttle Command
          Table shows the throttle commands that will be used 
          when driving the train over the warrant's route.
          Additional items on this tab allow you pick the engine to
          power your train and to test and modify the recorded
          script. Presently the <b>Throttle Commands</b> table is
          empty. The bottom half displays six
          outlined areas; <b>Choose Engine Consist</b>,
          <b>Setect Type</b>, <b>Settings</b>,
          <b>Learn mode</b>, <b>Run Parameters,</b> and <b>Test 
          Run Train,</b>. The first thing to do
          is to choose an engine consist.</p>

          <h3>Choosing a Train</h3>
          <p>The <b>Train Name</b> field is
          used to provide a name that can be displayed by an
          indicator track icon as the train travels along the
          warrant route. If you have defined an JMRI engine roster,
          the train names are displayed in the <b>Engine Roster</b>
          drop down ComboBox. Selecting a name from this list will
          fill in the <b>Train Name</b>, and <b>Address</b> text
          fields and assigns them to the warrant.</p>

          <p>A DCC address typed into the<b>Address</b> text field
          will be used whether or not it is found in the JMRI
          Engine Roster.</p>
          
          <p>The <b>View Speed Profile</b> button displays a table
          of the track speeds corresponding to the throttle settings
          for the addressed locomotive or consist. The speed
          units can be changed to scale speed.</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <b>Noye:</b> A value of "0.000" <b>does not</b> mean
            zero speed. It means there is no track speed for that
            throttle setting.
          </div>

          <h2>Learn Mode</h2>Throttle commands are created by
          recording the commands you send to a train while
          operating it manually from a throttle in <b>Learn
          Mode</b>. The <b>Prototypical</b> button should be
          chosen.

          <h3>Learn Mode Throttle</h3>If a train has been assigned,
          that is, has a valid DCC address in the warrant, then a
          throttle can be acquired by pressing the <b>Start</b>
          button. A screen throttle will be displayed. This
          throttle will operate the acquired train and all the
          throttle commands will be recorded until the <b>Stop</b>
          button is pressed.

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <b>Note:</b> It can be inconvenient to use the computer
            screen Learn Mode throttle. Under LocoNet a handheld
            throttle may "steal" the screen throttle address and
            its commands will be recorded. For all other systems a
            walkaround WiFi throttle can be used to record
            commands. Whatever throttle is used, start and stop the
            recording with the screen buttons.
          </div>
          <p>Pressing the <b>Stop</b> button will end the
          recording.</p>

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <b>Note:</b> The train must <b><i>not</i></b> be moving
            when the recording is stopped. <i>When play back of the
            warrant ends, the train might continue to run without a
            warrant to control it!</i> After recording a script, check 
            the ending throttle commands to see that the speed is set
            to 0.0           
          </div>
          
          <p>The learn script should be done with a completely
          clear route - All turnouts should be set for the
          route, all blocks unoccupied (except the origin), all signals
          should be set for clear running and no changes made during
          the recording period. When the train is run by playing
          back the script, any changes to signal aspects will be
          taken into account and the train's speed and scheduled
          times will be altered accordingly. The recorded 
          speeds and elapsed times should be for unrestricted
          "Normal" speeds.</p>
          
          	<p>In normal operation, when the script is played back, 
          	the train will follow the commands as recorded.
			However if a track condition ahead of it is detected that 
			requires a speed change, the warrant will modify the recorded
			speed accordingly.
			When the warrant makes such a speed change it "ramps" the change
			in small steps to give a more prototypical smooth look to
			the change.  When decreasing speed it calculates and issues
			these step-wise speed changes so that the required speed is 
			achieved just at the point where the speed limit must be enforced.
			When increasing speed it begins a similar "ramp up" when entering
			the block permitting the speed increase.
           <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">Warrant Speed Changes</a> has details
           about how warrants modify recorded speeds.</p>

			<h3>Run Parameters</h3>
            <p>This area has check boxes to modify how the train will operate
            when running the Warrant.</p>
			<ul>
                <li><b>Clearance to Share Route</b> - Normally a track warrant
                assigns exclusive rights to only one train.  This option allows
                several trains to share rights to a route, such as train sections
                following one another. Multiple "shared warrants" are still
                subject to ramping speed changes due to signals or rogue
                occupancy.</li>
                <li><b>Don't Ramp Speed Changes</b> - Suppress the
                ramping calculations. Instead, the Warrant makes immediate speed
                change upon entering the approach block to the block requiring
                a speed change. <span class="since">since 4.5.7</span></li>
                <li><b>Use Elapsed Time Only</b> - Do not use
                block detection. <i>Using this option allows Warrants to
                be run on layouts without block detection.</i></li>
			</ul> 
			Using the "Don't Ramp" or "Elapsed Time" options are the 
			only cases where block path lengths and engine speed factors
            are <i>not</i> necessary.
			
          <h2>Run Mode</h2>
          <p>After a script is recorded, pressing the
          <b>AutoRun</b> button in the <b>Test Run Train</b> box will
          send the throttle commands to the train specified in the
          warrant.</p>

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <b>NOTE:</b>Be sure that the train is located on the
            Path of the Origin block of the route and the direction
            of the engine is compatible with the first direction
            specified in the throttle commands.
          </div>
          <p>The <b>Status</b> field will display each block
          entered by the train as it traverses the route.

          <p>The <b>Test Run Train</b> box has four radio buttons to
          control the train and override the Throttle commands.

		    <ul>
			<li><b>Halt</b>Stop the train.</li>
			<li><b>Resume</b>Ramp the speed up to its previous speed.</li>
			<li><b>E-Stop</b>Issue an Emergency Stop to the train.</li>
			<li><b>Abort</b>Stop the train and null the warrant.</li>
			</ul>          
		  <h2>Saving the Warrant</h2>When you are satisfied with
          the performance of the warrant, press the <b>Save</b>
          button to add the warrant to the <a href=
          "WarrantTable.shtml">Warrant Table</a>.

          <h2>Throttle Command Table</h2>The Throttle Command Table
          has the following columns:

          <ul>
            <li><b>ET (msec)</b>: - The elapsed time in
            milliseconds to wait before issuing the throttle
            command.</li>

            <li><b>Command</b>: - The throttle command that was
            recorded (direction, speed, or button press or
            release).</li>

            <li><b>Value</b>: - The value of the command.</li>
            
            <li><b>Block or Sensor Name</b>: - The block the train occupied when
            the throttle command was recorded.</li>

            <li><b>Speed (mm/sec)</b> - The track speed of the
            recording train at the corresponding throttle setting.
          </ul>
          The recorded throttle commands execute according to
          the elapsed time between commands. The entry into each 
          block is recorded with a "NoOp"
          marker. These markers are used to synchronize the elapsed
          time of the automatic running of the train when it enters
          a block. This reset is done so events recorded in the block
          occur according to the elapsed time in the block.

          <h3>Synchronizing Commands to Block boundaries.</h3>
          In spite of attempting to maintain the recorded track
          speed, changing the consist of a train or
          perhaps even a temperature change between recording and
          playback, may result in the train not performing a
          throttle command at exactly the same place on the on the 
          route where the "Learn Mode" train recorded them.

          <p> The
          throttle commands of the next block will be delayed until
          the train enters the block. That is, the elapsed time of
          the NoOp command must be reached before any more commands
          are issued to the running train. This will be the case if
          the train is late in arriving at the block. On the other
          hand if the train arrives earlier than expected the
          remaining commands of the preceding block are executed in
          fractions of a second to catch up.</p>

          <p>If a more precise way is needed to have a script event
          occur at a particular location, see the section
          <b>Internal Synchronization From External Events</b>
          below.</p>

          <h3>Editing Recorded Throttle Commands</h3>
          Most of the columns in
          the Throttle Command Table can be edited. Perhaps you
          want to touch up the timing for the horn blasts or modify
          the speeds. Just enter the data you want. The values in
          the Throttle Command Table are changed by typing new
          entries into cells of the table.

          <p>Rows may be inserted or deleted from the table using
          the buttons to the right of the table. Note that an
          inserted row has 0 elapsed time from the previous command
          so you may want to adjust this by taking time away from
          either the previous row or the following row and entering
          it into the inserted row. Also, when a row is deleted,
          its elapsed time is added to the time of the following
          row. These default elapsed times for inserting and
          deleting rows are entered to keep the total elapsed time
          in the block constant.</p>

          <p>Some caution should be taken to only make modest
          changes since new commands when executed in playback
          could cause dramatic events. It may be wiser to re-record
          the commands in a new Learn Mode session if major changes
          are made.

          <h3>Track Speeds</h3>
          Recording the track speeds in the <b>Speed</b> column
          was added in <i>Release 4.9.2</i>.  On playback, if possible,
          the warrant uses track speed to make the throttle setting.
          For this to be done, a speed profile is needed for the
          locomotive/consist running the warrant.  The feature helps
          compensate for changes in the size of the train or
          different address of the power, by attempting to produce 
          the same track speed. Lacking a speed profile, the recorded
          throttle setting is used.  In <i>Release 4.9.4</i> the 
          scripted throttle setting is not modified by the track speed.
          (i.e. the above is a 4.9.2 feature only)
          
          <p>The DCC address used in the recording is the "standard 
          power" of the warrant. To base the track speeds on a different
          address or roster entry, select that entry and press the 
          <b>Add Speeds</b> button.  Warrants recorded before Release
          4.9.2 can be upgraded this way.</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <b>NOTE:</b>Recording track speeds in warrants makes 
            panels saved with Release 4.9.2 fail to load with earlier
            versions of JMRI. However, Recorded track speeds can be
            set to "0.000" by selecting no address or roster entry
            then pressing <b>Add Speeds</b>.  Saving the panel now
            will allow it to be loaded by earlier versions.
          </div>
           
          <h3>Triggering External Events From Scripts</h3>External
          animation or other events may be triggered by entering a
          "<i>Set Sensor</i>" command. To do this, insert a row
          with the words <b>Set Sensor</b> in the
          <b><i>Command</i></b> column and a valid sensor name in
          the <b><i>Block</i></b> column. The <b><i>Value</i></b>
          column should have the action you want the sensor to take
          at its execution time. That is enter the words <b>active</b> or
          <b>inactive</b>. Also enter the elapsed time when to
          trigger the setting of the sensor. On playback when this
          command is executed the state of the sensor will be set.

          <h3>Internal Synchronization From External Events</h3>
          <p>Additional synchronization can be done within
          a block. For example stopping a train at a water tower or
          over an uncoupling device or for any reason where using
          the elapsed time of a command is not precise enough. To
          do this, insert a row with the words <b>Wait Sensor</b>
          in the <b><i>Command</i></b> column and a valid sensor
          name in the <b><i>Block</i></b> column. The
          <b><i>Value</i></b> column should have the action words
          <b>active</b> or <b>inactive</b>. On playback when this
          command is executed the script is suspended and the current
          movement of the train is sustained until the sensor
          changes to the specified state. When that happens the
          script continues to execute according to the recorded
          times. In this case the "Wait Sensor" might be an optical
          sensor positioned to detect specific point. Bracket the
          "Wait Sensor" command with speed commands, the one before
          with a very slow speed and the one after with speed 0 (or
          -1). The script will then have the train creep at the
          slow speed until the sensor makes the detection. Then the
          script continues and the speed 0 command stops the train.
          </p>

          <p>The script and train will stay stopped until a
          second "Wait Sensor" command triggers the script to
          continue.</p>

          <p><b>Note:</b> Care must be taken when using this command.  To 
          be clear, the following is a sample script segment.</p>

          </table>
          <p>The train continues the speed of Command #11 until the 
          sensor at command #12 <b>changes</b> to active. If 
          already active, the train continues to move. Command #13
          stops the train and it remains stopped until the sensor
          at command #14 <b>changes</b> to inactive.</p>

          <h3>Automatic Sequencing of Scripts</h3>
          <span class="since">since 3.11.1</span>
          <p>It is possible to
          start another script from a script. To do this, insert a
          row with the words <b>Run Warrant</b> in the
          <b><i>Command</i></b> column and name of a warrant in the
          <b><i>Block</i></b> column. This command launches the
          second warrant. Note that a train with the address
          specified in the second warrant must be placed in the
          starting block of the second warrant.</p>

          <p>This feature can be used to loop a train repeatedly by
          using the same warrant name. If a script terminates with
          the destination block equal to the origin block, it will
          repeat for the number of times entered into the
          <b><i>Value</i></b> column. If a negative number is
          entered the script will repeat indefinitely until an
          abort command is manually issued. Another possibility
          would be to use warrant "from A to B" and warrant "from B
          to A", where warrant "from A to B" runs warrant "from B
          to A" and warrant "from B to A" runs warrant "from A to
          B" and each Warrant specifies the same train ID and the
          same number of repeats.</p>

          <h2>Running Trains on Dark Blocks</h2>
          <p>The Learn mode and
          Run Mode functions can be used on blocks that do not have
          detection sensors. However, without detection, other than
          the initial setting of turnouts, the warrant cannot reset
          the turnouts or modify its speed while the train is
          <em>en route</em>. This means there is no protection from
          rogue trains fouling the route or from turnouts being
          changed while the train is <em>en route</em>. Therefore,
          run trains with caution over Dark Blocks.</p>

          <p>Note that entry into a Dark Block is detected
          differently than an Occupancy Block. Obviously, entry
          into an occupancy Block is recorded when the occupancy
          block detects occupancy. However entry into a Dark Block
          can only be recorded when the previous
          occupancy Block shows no occupancy. That is, the elapsed
          time for entry into a Dark Block is recorded by the tail
          of the train entered the dark, not the head.</p>
