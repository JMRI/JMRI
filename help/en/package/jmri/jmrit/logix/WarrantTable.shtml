<h1>The Warrant List</h1>
<p>
The Warrant List is a list of all the recorded warrants.  For an overview 
discussion of warrants, see <a href="Warrant.shtml"> Warrants</a>.

<h2>Columns in the Warrant Table</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Warrant</b> - The name of the Warrant.</li> 
        <li><b>Route</b> - The route of the Warrant is listed in a drop down combo box by 
		clicking the table cell.</li>
        <li><b>Train Name</b> - The Train ID, as stated in the Roster.  This cell can be
		edited and its content is displayed by the Indicator Track Icons when the train
		occupies their OBlock (the Edit popup of Indicator Track Icons have a checkbox 
		to enable this function).</li>
        <li><b>DCC Address</b> - The DCC Address of the locomotive or consist.  This cell can
		be edited to correspond to the current motive power of the train.</li>
        <li><b>Allocate</b> - A button that reserves the route for the warrant.  The Indicator
		Track Icons display green to indicate the route.</li>
        <li><b>Deallocate</b> - A button that removes the reservation for the warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Set</b> - A button that allocates and sets the turnouts for the warrant route.</li>
        <li><b>AutoRun</b> - A button that runs the train over the route according to the 
		throttle commands of the warrant. The recorded speed of the train will be modified 
		according to the occupancy and signal aspects encountered on the route.  The 
		Indicator Track Icons display the current position of the
		of the train with a blue color.</li>
        <li><b>ManRun</b> - (hidden column) A button that allocates the warrant and sets the route for
        a manual operator to run the train.  The script is not run, but the route is displayed.
		of the train with a blue color.<br>
        (The default setting hides this column. To display it, right click the table header.)</li>
        <li><b>Control/Status</b> - The status of the warrant is shown.  It also has a 
		drop down combo box that can send commands to a running train.<br>
		<b><i>Note</b>: This column has two functions - 
		Status messages and control buttons.</i>
		<br>
		When running, the warrant will post a status message here; e.g. its current location
		and speed, error messages, etc.  
		<br>
		When clicked the following commands can be sent:
        <ul>
        	<li><b>Halt</b> - Temporarily halts the train and suspends execution of the 
			throttle command script</li>
		<li><b>Resume</b> - Ramps up the speed of the train to its former setting and 
			restarts the throttle command script
		<li><b>Move into Next Block</b> - Repeats the test for whether a signal aspect has changed or
			an occupied block ahead has cleared.  If the train has overrun a block where it is expected
			to be and now appears to be the obstacle preventing movement, this resets its location.
			(Occasionally a sensor change can be
			missed due to a short or other hardware malfunction.  This reset may allow 
			a stopped train to continue.)
		<li><b>Abort</b> - Abort the script and deallocate the warrant.</li>
	  </ul>
        <li><b>Edit</b> - A button that opens an editing window for the warrant,</li>
        <li><b>Delete</b> - A button that deletes the warrant.</li>
</ul></p>
<ul>
        <b>NOTE:</b> Warrants can only be created if the PanelPro configuration 
        has at least two OBlocks defined.
</ul>
<h2>The Warrant List Menus</h2>
The following item are under the <b>Warrants</b> menu.
<ul>
        <li><b>Concatenate Warrants</b> - Join two warrants together to become
        	a single warrant.  The last block and path of the first warrant must be
        	equal to the first block and path of the second warrant.</li>  
        <li><b>Create New Warrant</b> - After providing system and user names this
		opens a blank Warrant Editing Window to create a new warrant. The
        	operations of this frame are discussed in <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">
        	Creating and Editing Warrants</a>.</li>
	  <li><b>Train Trackers</b> - Opens window where the identity of trains can be
		displayed as they move from one occupancy block to another.</li>
	  <li><b>Create NXWarrant</b> - Opens a window to create an eNtry/eXit warrant.
	  		this is discussed in <a href="NXWarrant.shtml">About NXWarrants</a>.</li>
	  <li><b>Open Session Log</b> - Opens a window to name a file that records the
	  warrant and train tracking status messages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Warrant List Features</h2>
The following items are at the bottom of the window:
<p>
The <b>Create NXWarrant</b> button 0pens a window to create an eNtry/eXit warrant.
<p>
The <b>Halt all Trains</b> button causes all running warrants to halt their trains.
<p>
The <b>Status</b> field contains the last 20 messages from warrants.  Click in the 
field to display them.
<p>
<h2>Running Automated Trains</h2>
The throttle commands recorded in a warrant can be played back to run the train.  When running 
automated, additional control of the train can done through four choices: <b>Halt</b>,
<b>Resume</b> and <b>Abort</b> are commands to halt a running
automated train, restart it or stop the train and abort the remaining throttle commands.
<b>Move into Next Block</b> is "repair" command should the train overrun a block and
become "Lost".  This command aligns the warrant to the next block and restarts the train.
<p>
Although there are separate operations in the Warrant List table to reserve a Warrant route
(Allocate) and
set Turnouts and Signals (Set Route) these operations do not have to be done to run
an automated train.  An <b>AutoRun</b> operation can begin without them.  The train will
seek allocation and set turnouts as it proceeds on the route.  When
confronted with an occupied block, the train will stop and wait until the block clears.
When the next block is clear but the block beyond the next block is occupied, the
train will approach at reduced speed.  Similarly, if the Portals have been defined with
Signal Heads or Signal Masts protecting the blocks they join, the train will modify the
speed according to the appearance or aspect of the signal. An automated train will 
attempt to secure
allocation of the next two Blocks each time it enters a Block.  It also checks whether
the Block is occupied by an unknown train and will not enter if the Block is occupied.
<p>
As a safety feature, whenever a warranted train has permission to enter the 
next Block, the turnouts are reset.   Having permission from Signals means 
that resetting the turnouts should not interfere with any interlocking logic.  
In the absence of Signals, occupancy or allocation to another warrant  
may deny permission.  Only clearing the most restrictive of these conditions 
will give the auto-run train permission to proceed.  When such a denial is 
cleared, the train will proceed automatically.  The only thing that overrides 
having permission to proceed is if the user has set the control to "Halt".  The train will 
not move until the user sets "Resume".

<h3>When the Starting block is Unoccupied</h3>
If a warrant is started and  the starting block is not occupied, the warrant will
wait until the block is occupied.  When occupation occurs the warrant will set to
the "Halt" and wait for the user to set the "Resume" control.
Note it is vital that the correct train occupies the starting block. The address specified in
the warrant, is the train that will begin moving. 

<h2>How Signals Aspects and Block Speeds Modify A Train's Speed</h2>
When a warrant is running and its train enters a block, it looks ahead to see if any speed changes
are coming up.  The look ahead distance must be adequate for the train to be able
to stop should that be needed.  This distance is at least one block and could be several.
If a signal or block is encountered within this look ahead distance, and either the aspect of block
indicates the speed must be regulated, then the warrant must take action.
It needs to inform the engine of the speed changes in a smooth (and hopefully prototypical)
fashion and calculate when these speed changes should begin.
<ul>
	<b>Note:</b> If signals have not been configured in the Occupancy Block Tables nor
	have block speeds been configured there, the Speed Profile throttle factors will only be used when
	generating the ramp-up and ramp-down throttle commands in NXWarrants or when rouge
	occupancy is detected ahead.
</ul>
The significance of the above note means the default ramp parameters will probably be quite 
satisfactory if your trains do not respond to signal aspect speeds and block speeds.  
<p>
A default throttle factor and the layout scale is configured in <b>Preferences</b>
under the warrants tab.  The ramp up and ramp down parameters, <b>Ramp Step Time</b>
and <b>Ramp Step Throttle Increment</b> are also configured there.
<p>
Once a speed change is noted by reading a signal aspect or specified block speed ahead, 
the Warrant must calculate when to begin the speed change (ramp down or ramp up).  Both
the look ahead distance and the time when to begin the speed change require knowing the 
track speed.  Thus to get train to begin and end its speed changes at the proper points,
a factors that relate the throttle settings to the actual track speed is needed. 
Without such throttle factors a fast 
running engine may overrun the point where a speed change expects to be completed, or 
a slow running train may stop too far short of where it is expected..
<p>
The throttle factors obviously depend upon the particular engine's power curve.  This is a combination
of decoder's throttle speed curve and the response of the locomotive motor to the voltage
set by the speed curve.  It is nearly impossible to set a single throttle factor that will 
work over the engine's entire speed range in both forward and reverse directions.  A complete
Speed Profile for every speed step of a decoder can be made with the Roster speed Profiling tool.
Alternatively, Speed Profile factors for a selected set of throttle settings for the motive power 
used in a warrant can be determined by using the NXWarrant
<b>Compute Throttle Factor</b> feature.  Frequently, calibrating a slow, medium and fast throttle setting for both
forward and reverse will be sufficient.  See <a href="NXWarrant.shtml"> NXWarrants</a> for
instructions on how to do this.
