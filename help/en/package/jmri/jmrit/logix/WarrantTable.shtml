      <h1>The Warrant List</h1>

      <p>The Warrant List is a list of all the recorded warrants.
      It also temporarily lists NXWarrants during the time they 
      are in effect.
      For an overview discussion of warrants, see <a href=
      "Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>.</p>

      <h2>Columns in the Warrant Table</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Warrant</b> - The name of the Warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Route</b> - The route of the Warrant is listed in a
        drop down combo box by clicking the table cell.</li>

        <li><b>Train Name</b> - The Train ID, as stated in the
        Roster. This cell can be edited and its content is
        displayed by the Indicator Track Icons when the train
        occupies their OBlock (the Edit popup of Indicator Track
        Icons have a checkbox to enable this function).</li>

        <li><b>DCC Address</b> - The DCC Address of the locomotive
        or consist. This cell can be edited to correspond to the
        current motive power of the train.</li>

        <li><b>Allocate</b> - A button that reserves the route for
        the warrant. The Indicator Track Icons display green to
        indicate the route.</li>

        <li><b>Deallocate</b> - A button that removes the
        reservation for the warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Set</b> - A button that allocates and sets the
        turnouts for the warrant route.</li>

        <li><b>AutoRun</b> - A button that runs the train over the
        route according to the throttle commands of the warrant.
        The recorded speed of the train will be modified according
        to the occupancy and signal aspects encountered on the
        route. The Indicator Track Icons display the current
        position of the of the train with a blue color.</li>

        <li><b>ManRun</b> - (hidden column) A button that allocates
        the warrant and sets the route for a manual operator to run
        the train. The script is not run, but the route is
        displayed. of the train with a blue color.<br>
        (The default setting hides this column. To display it,
        right click the table header.)</li>

        <li>
          <b>Control/Status</b> - The status of the warrant is
          shown. It also has a drop down combo box that can send
          commands to a running train.<br>
          <b><i>Note</i>: This column has two functions - Status
          messages and control buttons.</b><br>
          When running, the warrant will post a status message
          here; e.g. its current location and speed, error
          messages, etc.<br>
          When clicked the following commands can be sent:

          <ul>
            <li><b>Halt</b> - Temporarily ramps the train down
            to a stop and
            suspends execution of the throttle command script</li>

            <li><b>Resume</b> - Ramps up the speed of the train to
            its former setting and restarts the throttle command
            script</li>

            <li><b>Move into Next Block</b> - Repeats the test for
            whether a signal aspect has changed or an occupied
            block ahead has cleared. If the train has overrun a
            block where it is expected to be and now appears to be
            the obstacle preventing movement, this resets its
            location. (Occasionally a sensor change can be missed
            due to a short or other hardware malfunction. This
            reset may allow a stopped train to continue.)</li>

			<li><b>E-Stop</b> - Issues an emergency stop to the train
			and suspends execution of the throttle command script.
			</li>
            <li><b>Abort</b> - Abort the script and deallocate the
            warrant.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Edit</b> - A button that opens an editing window for
        the warrant,</li>

        <li><b>Delete</b> - A button that deletes the warrant.</li>
      </ul>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <b>Note:</b> Warrants can only be created if the PanelPro
        configuration has at least two OBlocks defined.
        <br>Click in the table heading to select columns to be 
        hidden or visible.
      </div>

      <h2>The Warrant List Menus</h2>The following item are under
      the <b>Warrants</b> menu.

      <ul>
        <li><b>Concatenate Warrants</b> - Join two warrants
        together to become a single warrant. The last block and
        path of the first warrant must be equal to the first block
        and path of the second warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Create New Warrant</b> - After providing system and
        user names this opens a blank Warrant Editing Window to
        create a new warrant. The operations of this frame are
        discussed in <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and
        Editing Warrants</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Train Trackers</b> - Opens window where the identity
        of trains can be displayed as they move from one occupancy
        block to another.</li>

        <li><b>Create NXWarrant</b> - Opens a window to create an
        eNtry/eXit warrant. this is discussed in <a href=
        "NXWarrant.shtml">About NXWarrants</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Open Session Log</b> - Opens a window to name a file
        that records the warrant and train tracking status
        messages to the file.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other Warrant List Features</h2>The following items are
      at the bottom of the window:

      <p>The <b>Create NXWarrant</b> button 0pens a window to
      create an eNtry/eXit warrant.</p>

      <p>The <b>Stop all Trains</b> button causes all running
      warrants to halt their trains.</p>

      <p>The <b>Status</b> field contains the last 20 messages from
      warrants. Click in the field to display them.</p>

      <h2>Running Automated Trains</h2>The throttle 
      commands recorded in a warrant are played back to run the
      train, but additional control of the train can be 
      done through five choices: <b>Halt</b>, <b>Resume</b>,
      <b>Move into Next Block</b> and <b>Abort</b>. The first two
      commands halt a running train and restart it, keeping the 
      warrant in effect. <b>Move into Next Block</b> is "repair" command
      should the train overrun a block and become "Lost". This
      command aligns the warrant to the next block and restarts the
      train. The <b>Abort</b> command does an emergency stop and 
      annuls the warrant.

      <p>There are separate operations in the Warrant List
      table to reserve a Warrant route; (<b>Allocate</b>) and 
      set  turnouts for the route (<b>Set</b>). These operations 
      do not have to be done to run an automated train. They are
      used to preview the route. An <b>AutoRun</b> operation
      can begin without them. The train will seek allocation and
      set turnouts as it proceeds on the route.</p>
      
      <p>As a safety feature, whenever a warranted train has
      permission to enter the next Block, the turnouts are reset
      to the route. Having permission from Signals should mean
       that resetting the
      turnouts does not interfere with any interlocking logic.
      "Stop" aspects of Signals, occupancy or allocation to another
      warrant will deny permission. Only clearing the most
      restrictive of these conditions will give the auto-run train
      permission to proceed. When such a denial is cleared, the
      train will proceed automatically. The only thing that
      overrides automatically proceeding is if the user has set
      the control to "Halt". The train will not move until the user
      sets "Resume".</p>

      <p> When confronted
      with an occupied block, the train will stop and wait until
      the block clears. When the next block is clear but the block
      beyond the next block is occupied, the train will approach at
      reduced speed. Similarly, if the Portals have been defined
      with Signal Heads or Signal Masts protecting the blocks they
      join, the train will modify the speed according to the
      appearance or aspect of the signal. An automated train will
      attempt to secure allocation of the blocks ahead each time
      it enters a Block. It also checks whether the block is
      occupied by an unknown train and will not enter if the Block
      is occupied. <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">Modifying Warrant Speeds</a>
      has details about how warrants modify recorded speeds.</p>

      <h3>When the Starting block is Unoccupied</h3>If a warrant is
      started and the starting block is not occupied, the warrant
      will wait until the block is occupied. When occupation occurs
      the warrant will set to the "Halt" and wait for the user to
      set the "Resume" control. Note it is vital that the correct
      train occupies the starting block. The address specified in
      the warrant, is the train that will begin moving.
