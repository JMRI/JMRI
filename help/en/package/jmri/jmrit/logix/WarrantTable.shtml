<H1>Creating and Editing Warrants</H1>

A Warrant contains the information needed to run a train. This includes
the DCC address of the locomotive(s), 
the route train will take, the settings of the turnouts
to traverse the route and the throttle commands to use
at various points along the route - e.g. speed, when to show lights, sound horns,
bells or other sound effects.
<ul>
        <b>NOTE:</b> Warrants can only be created if the PanelPro configuration 
        has at least two OBlocks defined.
</ul>
There are three steps in creating a warrant, define the route, select a 
train and record the throttle commands.
</p>
<H2>Defining a Warrant Route</H2>

<H3>Origin, Destination and Via Blocks</H3>
A warrant route is created by selecting the the Block and path where
the train will begin its trip and the portal by which it should leave.  Then
select the Bock and path where the train should end its trip.
Press the <b>Calculate Route</b> button and the the computer will determine all the
intermediate paths needed to make the trip.
<ul>
        <b>NOTE:</b> in the upper right hand portion of the Create/Edit 
        Warrant frome is a table listing all the OBlocks you have defined.
        Either the System Name or the User Name can be dragged and dropped
        into the location blocks on the upper left hand side of the frame.
</ul>
<ul>
        <li><b>Originating Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for the
        originating <b>Block Name</b>, a drop down menu to choose the starting
        <b>Path Name</b> and a drop down menu to select the <b>Exit Portal
        Name</b>.
        <br>Note that the block may have several paths and the default path
        showing may not be the one where you intend the train to start.
        <br> 
        Also, Since paths usually have two portals, the default portal
        showing may not be the one the train should pass through.
        <p>
        Setting the Exit Portal determines the direction the train will
        take.  There is no further need to specify direction, since the 
        algorithm will provide the route.</li>

        <li><b>Destination Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for the
        destination <b>Block Name</b> and a drop down menu for the terminating
        <b>Path Name</b>.
        <br>Note that the block may have several paths and the default path
        showing may not be the one where you intend the train to finish its run.
        </li>
        <li><b>Via Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for the
        destination <b>Via Name</b> and a drop down menu for the terminating
        <b>Path Name</b>.
        <br>Typically, it is not necessary to enter any block name in this 
        field, since it likely the algorithm will detect the route
        you want.  This group of entries is used when there are multiple 
        routes possible from origin to destination.   Entering a block and
        path will make the computer contimue its search for a route that 
        passes through the selected block and path.
        </li>
</ul>
More information about <b>OBlocks</b>, <b>Portals</b> and <b>OPaths</b>
can be found at <a href="OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block Tables</a>.
</p>
<H3>Calculate and Debug</H3>
After the origin and destination blocks and paths have been chosen, press
the <b>Calculate Route</b> button.  If a route is found, the Route Table is
filled out indicating each block, path and portals used to traverse the route.
</p><p>
If the message "No Route found 
from "Origin Block', path ..." etc. is displayed
and you have checked the blocks, paths and exit portal, and believe them to be 
correct, press the <b>Debug Route</b> button.</p>
</p><p>  
The same message will be displayed
but after dismissing it, a window with a tree is opened.  Tracing through the
tree by clicking on nodes will show the blocks and paths the computer has tried
to make a route.  At the end of each branch, the leaf node will be the point 
where it could not continue.  This is the place where you may find an error or
omission that you made when defining the OBlocks, OPaths and Portals.
</p>

<H2>Choosing a train</H2>
If you have defined an JMRI engine roster, the train names are displayed in
the <b>Engine Roster</b> drop down ComboBox.  Selecting a name from this list
will fill in the text fields:
<b>Train Name</b>, <b>Road Name</b> and <b>Number</b>, <b>DCC Adddress</b>.
<p>
You may also choose a train by entering a DCC address in the <b>DCC Adddress</b>
text field.  This address will be used whether or not it is found in the
IJMRI engine roster. 
</p>

<H2>Learn Mode</H2>
Throttle commands are created by recording the commands you send to a train
while operating it manually from a screen throttle in <b>Learn Mode</b>.

<H3>"Teaching" a Train</H3>
Pressing the <b>Start</b> button in the <b>Learn Mode</b> box
will display a throttle on the screen.  
Operate the train just as you would with any other throttle.  All speed 
changes and button presses on the throttle are recorded in the Throttle 
Command Table.
<p>
Pressing the <b>Stop</b> button will end the recording.
</p> 
<H3>Throttle Command Table</H3>
The Throttle Command Table has the following columns:
<ul>
        <li><b>ET(msec)</b>: - The elapsed time in milliseconds to wait after 
        a command is sent before issuing the next throttle command.</li>
        <li><b>Command</b>: - The throttle command that was recorded (direction, speed, 
        or button press or release).</li>
        <li><b>Value</b>: - The value of the command.</li> 
        <li><b>Block</b>: - The block the train has last entered when the throttle
        command was recorded.</li>
        <li><b>Delete</b>: - Deletes the command.  Note that this will also remove 
        some of the elapsed time between the previous and next commands of the deleted 
        command.</li>
</ul>
All of the columns in the Throttle Command Table can be edited.  Perhaps you want to
touch up the horn blasts or modify the speeds.
</p>

<H3>Synchronizing Commands to Block boundaries.</H3>
If the consist of a train changes, or if power is changed, the recorded elapsed times
may not allow the throttle commands to execute at the same points on the route where
the "Learn Mode" train recorded them.
<p>
If this is the case, Enter the word "<b>Synch</b>" in the "ET" (elapsed time) column.  
When the train
is run in "Run Mode", it will hold back a "Synch" command until it reaches and enters
the block specified in the "Block" column of the command.
<ul>
        <b>NOTE:</b>Be sure that the block named in the "Block" of a "Synch" command
        has not been entered by the train.  If the train has already reached that
        block, the command will not be issued.
        <p>
        Also, if block ahead of the train becomes occupied before the train can enter it,
        a "Synch" command may execute prematurely.  This can happen if a "rouge train"
        enters a block on the route ahead of the train.
</ul>
</p>

<H3>Running Trains on Dark Blocks.</H3>
The Learn mode and Run Mode functions can be used on blocks that do not have detection sensors.
However, without detection, other than the initial setting of turnouts and signals,
turnouts and signals cannot be set on the fly while the train is enroute.  This means
there is no protection from rouge trains fouling the route or from turnouts being changed
while the train is enroute.  Therefore use these features
with caution over dark blocks.  "Synch" may not be used as well.

<H2>Run Mode</H2>
Pressing the <b>Run</b> button in the <b>Run Train</b> box
will send the throttle commands to the train specified in the warrant.
<ul>  
        <b>NOTE:</b>Be sure that the train is located on the Path of the Origin block 
        of the route and the direction of the engine is compatible with the first direction
        specified in the throttle commands.
</ul>
The <b>Run Train</b> box will display each block entered by the train as it traverses
the route.  Each time an auto running train enters a block it check the succeeding two 
blocks for occupancy.  Depending on what is detected, signals are set for clear, approach
or stop and the current speed is modified accordingly (normal, limited or stop).  This
check for occupancy will also reset the turnouts for the route, if they have been 
inadvertently changed from another source.
<p>
The occupancy detection and synchronized commands used to notify a train when it enters
a block depends on accuracte occupancy detection.  If the layout does not have reliable 
occupancy detection, automated trains may run with unexpected consequences.  Trains may
wait indefititely when false detection occurs.  The block
protection done when entering a block can be disabled.  The following radio buttons set 
this:
<ul>
        <li><b>Run with block Protection</b>: - Runs the train with the occupancy detection
        when entering blocks and with the synchroniation features.</li>
        <li><b>Run with blocks dark</b>: - Runs the train as described for Dark Blocks.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Controls</H3>
The <b>Run Train</b> box also is a drop down ComboBox that has the following commands
that can be sent to the train.
<ul>
        <li><b>Halt</b>: - Stops the train.</li>
        <li><b>Resume</b>: - Restarts the train at the speed setting it had when stopped.</li>
        <li><b>Abort</b>: - Terminates the automated run.</li> 
</ul>

<H2>Save Etc.</H2>
There are three buttons at the bottom of the window.

<ul>
        <li><b>Save</b>: - Saves the warrant so it can be shown in the list of warrants on the
        Warrant Table.  A permanent copy of the warrant is saved when the panel is
        saved to the Configuration file.</li>
        <li><b>Cancel</b>: - Cancels any editing that may have been done.</li>
        <li><b>Delete</b>: - Deletes the warrant when the panel is
        saved to the Configuration file.</li> 
</ul>
