<H1>Creating and Editing Warrants</H1>

A Warrant contains the information needed to run a train. This includes
the DCC address of the locomotive(s), 
the route train will take, the settings of the turnouts
to traverse the route and the throttle commands to use
at various points along the route - e.g. speed, when to show lights, sound horns,
bells or other sound effects.
<ul>
        <b>NOTE:</b> Warrants can only be created if the PanelPro configuration 
        has at least two OBlocks defined.
</ul>
There are three steps in creating a warrant, 1. define the route; 2. select a 
train; and 3. record the throttle commands.
</p>
<H2>Defining a Warrant Route</H2>
Routes are created using the <b>Define Route</b> tab in the Edit Warrant window.</p>
 
<H3>Origin, Destination, Via and Avoid Blocks</H3>

The Origin Block is obviously where a train given this route will start and the
starting path within the origin block is the track it is on - e.g. a path named
"Departure Track #3" in block named "Main Terminal".
Choosing the portal of the path, e.g. portal "West Approach to #3" where the 
train should exit the origin block determines the
direction of the train on the route.  A computer algorithm will
find portals, paths and blocks needed to take the train to the Destination Block and
path - e.g. "Arrival Track #1" in the destination block.</p>
<p>
A warrant route is created by selecting the the block and path where
the train will begin its trip and the portal by which it should leave.  Then you
select the block, path and entry portal where the train should end its trip.
Press the <b>Calculate Route</b> button and the the computer will determine all the
intermediate paths needed to make the trip.
<ul>
        <b>NOTE:</b> in the upper right hand portion of the Create/Edit 
        Warrant frame is a table listing all the OBlocks you have defined.
        Either the system name or the user name of the block can be dragged and dropped
        into the location blocks on the upper left hand side of the frame.
</ul>
<ul>
        <li><b>Originating Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for the
        originating <b>Block Name</b>, a drop down menu to choose the starting
        <b>Path Name</b> and a drop down menu to select the <b>Exit Portal
        Name</b>.
        <ul>
        The block may have several paths and the default path
        showing may not be the one where you intend the train to start.
        Also, Since paths usually have two portals, the exit portal
        showing may not be the one the train should pass through when
        leaving the origin block.
        </ul>
        Setting the Exit Portal determines the direction the train will
        take.  There is no further need to specify direction, since the 
        algorithm will only provide routes that leave in that direction.</li>

        <li><b>Destination Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for the
        destination <b>Block Name</b> and a drop down menu for the terminating
        <b>Path Name</b> and a drop down menu to select the <b>Entry Portal
        Name</b>.
        <ul>
        As above the block may have several paths and the path
        where you intend the train to finish its run needs to be specified.
        It is important to specify the
        Entry portal for the destination.  This is needed when the layout has 
        reversing loops allowing the path to be entered from either end. 
        <i>A common mistake where no route will be found is to specify an entry 
        portal or path that cannot
        be reached by the direction taken when leaving the origin block.</i> 
        </ul>
<ul>
	<b>Note:</b> when a path is chosen, only the Portals of that path are shown
		in the Exit or Entry Portal drop down menus.  Thus, even though
		the block may have many portals, you will only see at most two portals.
</ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Via Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for a
        block the <b>Via Name</b> and a drop down menu for the
        <b>Path Name</b>.
        <br>Typically, it is not necessary to enter any block name in this 
        field, since it is likely the algorithm will detect the route
        you want.  This entry is used when there are many 
        routes possible from origin to destination and you want only to 
        consider routes passing through a particular path on this block. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Avoid Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for a
        block the <b>Avoid Name</b> and a drop down menu for the
        <b>Path Name</b>.
        <br>This entry is used when there are many 
        routes possible from origin to destination and you want only to 
        consider routes that do not pass through a particular path on this block. 
        </li>
More information about <b>OBlocks</b>, <b>Portals</b> and <b>OPaths</b>
can be found at <a href="OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block Tables</a>.
</p>

<H3>Calculate and Debug</H3>
After the origin and destination blocks and paths have been chosen, press
the <b>Calculate Route</b> button.
The "Searching for Route" text box will show some statistics on the number of routes
and their length in blocks that have been found while searching for routes.  
The text field "Max Number of Blocks in Route" limits how far the computer will look
routes.  The <b>Stop</b> button will terminate
the search for routes.
<p>
After the Stop button is pressed or the computer exhausts
all the possible routes less than or equal the "max length", it presents a list 
of the routes that it found and their lengths.
Choose a route by pressing its radio button.  Pressing the <b>Review</b> button 
will display the route for you to examine in the Route Table. Each block, path 
and portals used to traverse the route is displayed. 
</p><p>
You may inspect all the routes in this 
manner.  Choosing a route and pressing the <b>Select</b> button will 
dismiss the dialog. and bring up the <b>Record/Playback Script</b> tab.
If exactly one route is found, the list dialog is skipped.  
</p><p>
<p>Frequently, more than one route will be found and the list may be quite long
- especially when the route is a repeating
loop.  If the list is too lengthy, there are several ways 
you can restrict the number of routes found.
<ul> 
	<li>1. Specify a maximum number of blocks to use in a route by entering a
	number in the <b>Max Number of Blocks in Route</b> box.  The computer will only
	list routes with this number or fewer blocks</li>
	<li>2. Specify an intermediate <b>Via Location</b> block and path that must be 
	included in the route.  The computer will calculate the route with this "must include"
	restriction and present you only with routes through the specified "Via" block
	and path.</li>
	<li>3. Specify an <b>Avoid Location</b> block and path that must not be in the route.
	The computer will not list any routes containing this "must avoid" block and path</li> 
</ul></p>
<p>
Sometimes the dialog message "No Route found 
from "Origin Block', path ..." etc. is displayed. Responding <b>Yes</b> to the
question, "Show the search tree?" will open a window with a graphic description of 
all paths begining at the Origin block, path and exit portal.  Trace what you 
believe to be a likely route by clicking on the nodes.  Each node is a block
path and will display its path and block name and the entry and exit portals
it uses.  At the end of each branch, the leaf node will be the point 
where the route could not continue.  Normally these leaves are spurs.
However, these are also the places where you may find an error or
omission that you made when defining the OBlocks, OPaths and Portals.
As you trace the attempted routes you
may find that you have forgotten to enter a path or mis-labeled the correct portal
to a path.  <i>A common mistake is to incorrectly specify the portal that must be used 
to leave the starting block or to enter the destination block.</i></p>
<p>
When you are satisfied with the route, select the <b>Record/Playback Script</b> tab.</p>

<H2>Recording and Editing a Script</H2>
Recording a script is done from the <b>Record/Playback Script</b> tab.
Radio buttons on this tab allow you to select either the Route Table or the Throttle Command
Table.  The Route Table shows the track circuits (OBlock, Portals and Paths) the warrant
defines.  The Throttle Command Table shows each throttle command that is recorded
in "Learn Mode".  After recording, the table can be edited.  Additional items on this tab
allow you pick the engine to power your train and to test and modify the recorded script.

<H3>Choosing a train</H3>
The <b>Train Name</b> field is used to provide a name that can be displayed by an 
indicator track icon as the train travels along the warrant route.
</p> 
If you have defined an JMRI engine roster, the train names are displayed in
the <b>Engine Roster</b> drop down ComboBox.  Selecting a name from this list
will fill in the <b>Train Name</b>, and <b>Adddress</b> text fields and assigns them to 
the warrant.
<p>
A DCC address typed into the<b>Adddress</b>
text field will be used whether or not it is found in the
JMRI engine roster. 
</p>

<H2>Learn Mode</H2>
Throttle commands are created by recording the commands you send to a train
while operating it manually from a screen throttle in <b>Learn Mode</b>.

<H3>Learn Mode Throttle</H3>
If a train has been assigned, that is, has a valid DCC address in the warrant,
then a throttle can be acquired by pressing the <b>Start</b> button.  This
throttle will operate the acquired train and all the throttle commands will be
recorded until the <b>Stop</b> button is pressed.
<p>
The learn script should be done with a completely clear route - All turnouts 
set should be set for the route, all blocks unoccupied (except origin), all 
signals should be set for clear runing and no changes made during the recording
period.  When the train is run by playing back the script, any changes to signal
aspects will be taken into account and the train's speed and scheduled times
will be altered accordingly.
<p>
Pressing the <b>Stop</b> button will end the recording.
</p>

<H2>Run Mode</H2>
Pressing the <b>AutoRun</b> button in the <b>Run Train</b> box
will send the throttle commands to the train specified in the warrant.
<ul>  
        <b>NOTE:</b>Be sure that the train is located on the Path of the Origin block 
        of the route and the direction of the engine is compatible with the first direction
        specified in the throttle commands.
</ul>
The <b>Run Train</b> box will display each block entered by the train as it traverses
the route.  
<p>
The occupancy detection and synchronized commands used to notify a train when it enters
a block depends on accurate occupancy detection.  If the layout does not have reliable 
occupancy detection, automated trains may run with unexpected consequences.  Trains may
wait indefinitely when false detection occurs.  The block
protection done when entering a block can be disabled.  The following radio buttons set 
this:
<ul>
        <li><b>Run with block Protection</b>: - Runs the train with the occupancy detection
        when entering blocks and with the synchronization features.</li>
        <li><b>Run with blocks dark</b>: - Runs the train as described for Dark Blocks.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Running Automated Trains</H2>
The recorded throttle commands can be played back to run the train.  When running 
automanted, additional control of the train can done through three choices: <b>Halt</b>,
<b>Resume</b> and <b>Abort</b>.  As suggested by the names, these command stop a running
automated train, restart it or stop the train and abort the remaining throttle commands.
<p>
Although there are separate operations in the Warrant List table to reserve a warrant route
(Allocate) and
set turnouts and signals (Set Route) these operations do not have to be done to run
an automated train.  A <b>AutoRun</b> operation can begin without them.  The train will
seek allocation and set turnouts as it proceeds on the route.  When
confronted with an occupied block, the train will stop and wait until the block clears.
When the next block is clear but the block beyond the next block is occupied, the
train will approach at reduced speed.  Similarly, if the Portals have been defined with
Signal Heads or Signal Masts protecting the blocks they join, the train will modify the
speed according to the appearance or aspect of the signal. An automated train will 
attempt to secure
allocation of the next two blocks each time it enters a block.  It also checks whether
the block is occupied by an unknown train and will not enter if the block is occupied.
<p>
As a safety feature, whenever a warranted train has permission to enter the 
next block, the turnouts are reset.   Having permission from signals means 
that resetting the turnouts should not interfere with any interlocking logic.  
In the absence of signals, occupancy or allocation to another warrant also 
may deny permission.  It is the most restrictive of these three conditions 
that gives the auto-run train permission to proceed.  When such a denial is 
cleared, the train will proceed automatically.  The only thing that overrides 
having permission to proceed is if the user has set the control to "Halt".  The train will 
not move until the user sets "Resume".
<p>
If a warrant is started and  the stating block is not occupied, the warrant will
wait until the block is occupied.  When occupation occurs the warrant will start
executing so is vital that the correct train, i.e. has the address specified in
the warrant, occupies the block. 
</p>   
The <b>Throttle Adjustment</b>
text field can be used to modify the throttle setting by a fixed ratio for all
speed commands.  - or individual commands may have their throttle setting or elapsed
time value changed by editing the throttle command table.
<p>

<H3>Throttle Command Table</H3>
The Throttle Command Table has the following columns:
<ul>
        <li><b>ET(msec)</b>: - The elapsed time in milliseconds to wait before 
        issuing the throttle command.</li>
        <li><b>Command</b>: - The throttle command that was recorded (direction, speed, 
        or button press or release).</li>
        <li><b>Value</b>: - The value of the command.</li> 
        <li><b>Block</b>: - The block the train occupied when the throttle
        command was recorded.</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<H3>Synchronizing Commands to Block boundaries.</H3>
Changing the consist of a train or perhaps even a temperature change 
between recording and playback, may result in the train not performing a throttle
command at the same place on the on the route where
the "Learn Mode" train recorded them. 
<p>
The entry into each block is recorded with a "NoOp" marker.  These markers are used to
synchronize the elapsed time of the automatic running of the train when it enters a block
to its recorded elapsed time in the block. 
The throttle commands
of the next block will be delayed until the train enters the block if the train is
late in arriving, or by skipping the remaining elapsed time
if the train arrives earlier than expected.
<p>
In extreme cases or block synchronization may
still be unsatisfactory.  You may also lengthen or shorten the elapsed times for 
entering a block by editing the throttle commands.
<p>
Another option is to use the <b>Throttle Adjustment</b> to enter a ratio to multiply the 
throttle setting and thus supply more or less power. 
<ul>
        <b>NOTE:</b>The throttle adjustment factor is not permanently saved.  The default 
        multiplier is always 1.0.  Whenever a factor is wanted, it must be entered manually 
        each time the warrant is run. - <b>or be set by Logix</b> when Logix is used to set 
        the trainId and run the warrant.  The recorded and edited throttle commands are the 
        base settings for each warrant run.  TrainId and Throttle Factor can be set 
	  as desired for each warrant run.
</ul>
If a more precise way is needed to have a script event occur at a particular location, 
see the
<b>Internal Synchronization From External Events</b> below.
</p>

<H3>Editing Recorded Throttle Commands</H3>
The throttle commands recorded in <b>Learn Mode</b> can be edited, however,
caution should be taken to only make modest changes since new commands
when executed in playback could cause dramatic events.  It may be wiser to
re-record the commands in a new Learn Mode session if major changes are made.
<p> 
The recorded throttle commands execute according to the elapsed time between commands.
The elapsed time (ET column) may be modified and even the command may be changed.
Rows may be deleted and additional rows inserted.   
<p>
Rows can be inserted into Throttle command Table so the train can set external sensor
states or respond to the state of an external sensor. 

The run protection discussed in previous sections and synchronizing commands
depends on reliable occupancy detection.  If the layout is prone to have spurious 
false detection signals, then automated running will be unsatisfactory - trains may wait
indefinitely for phantom trains to release occupancy or run indefinitely by not
receiving a synchronizing signal.  The train can be run using the elapsed times
between commands only and skip the block protection mentioned above i.e. "Run with
Blocks Dark".

<H3>Editing Throttle Commands</H3>

All of the columns in the Throttle Command Table can be edited.  Perhaps you want to
touch up the timing for the horn blasts or modify the speeds.  Just enter the data you want.
The values in the Throttle Command Table are changed by typing new entries into cells
of the table.  
<p>
Rows may be inserted or deleted from the table using the buttons to the 
right of the table.  Note that an inserted row has 0 elapsed time from the previous 
command so you may want to adjust this by taking time away from either the previous
row or the following row and entering it into the inserted row.  Also, when a row is
deleted, its elapsed time is added to the time of the following row.  These default 
elapsed times for inserting and deleting rows are entered to keep the total
elapsed time in the block constant.
</p>

<H3>Triggering External Events From Scripts</H3>

External animation or other events may be triggered by entering a "<i>Set Sensor</i>"
command.  To do this, insert a row with the words <b>Set Sensor</b> in the 
Command column and
a valid sensor name in the <i>Block</i> column.  The <i>Value</i> column should 
have the action 
you want the sensor to take at its execution time - the words "active" or "inactive".
Also enter the elapsed time when to trigger the setting of the sensor.  On playback
when this command is executed the state of the sensor will be set.
</p>

<H3>Internal Synchronization From External Events</H3>
Additional synchronization can be done within a block.  For example stopping a train
at a water tower or over an uncoupling device or for any reason where using the elapsed
time of a command is not precise enough. To do this, insert a row with the words 
<b>Wait Sensor</b> in the Command column and
a valid sensor name in the <i>Block</i> column.  The <i>Value</i> column should 
have the action 
words "active" or "inactive".  On playback when this command is executed the script
pauses and the current
movement of the train is sustained until the sensor changes to the specified state.
When that happens the script continues to execute according to the recorded 
times.  In this case the "Wait Sensor" might be an optical sensor positioned to
detect specific point.  Bracket the "Wait Sensor" command with speed commands, the
one before with a very slow speed and the one after with speed 0 (or -1).  The script will
then have the train creep at the slow speed until the sensor makes the detection.
Then the script continues and the speed 0 command stops the train.
<p>
Likewise the script and train may stay stopped until a second "Wait Sensor" command 
triggers the script to continue.
<p>
If the "Wait Sensor" is already at the specified state when playback executes its
command the script continues. 

<H3>Automatic Sequencing of Scripts</H3>

It is possible to start another script from a script. To do this, insert a row 
with the words 
<b>Run Warrant</b> in the Command column and name of a warrant in the <i>Block</i> column.  
This command 
launches the second warrant.  Note that a train with the address specified in the second 
warrant must be placed in the starting block of the second warrant.
<p> 
This feature can be used to loop a train repeatedly by using the same warrant name.  
If a script terminates with the destination block
equal to the origin block, it will repeat for the number of times entered into the 
<i>Value</i>
column.  If a negative number is entered the script will repeat indefinitely until 
an abort command is manually
issued.  Another possibility would be to use warrant "from A to B" and warrant 
"from B to A", 
where warrant "from A to B" runs warrant "from B to A" and warrant "from B to A"
runs warrant "from A to B" and each warrant specifies the same train Id and the 
same number of repeats.
</p>

<H3>Running Trains on Dark Blocks</H3>
The Learn mode and Run Mode functions can be used on blocks that do not have 
detection sensors.
However, without detection, other than the initial setting of turnouts, the warrant
cannot reset the turnouts or modify its speed while the train is enroute.  This means
there is no protection from rouge trains fouling the route or from turnouts being changed
while the train is enroute.  Therefore run trains
with caution over dark blocks.
<p>Note that entry into a dark block is detected differently that an occupancy block.
Obviously, entry into an occupancy block is recorded when the occupancy block detects
occupancy.  However entry into a dark block can only be recorded as the time when the
previous occupancy block shows no occupancy.  That is, the elapsed time for entry into 
a dark block is recorded by the
tail of the train not the head.</p>

<H2>Save Etc.</H2>
There are three buttons at the bottom of the window.

<ul>
        <li><b>Save</b>: - Saves the warrant so it can be shown in the list of warrants 
	  on the Warrant Table.  A permanent copy of the warrant is saved when the panel is
        saved to the Configuration file.</li>
	  <li><b>copy</b>: - Makes a copy of the warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Cancel</b>: - Cancels any editing that may have been done.</li>
        <li><b>Delete</b>: - Deletes the warrant when the panel is
        saved to the Configuration file.</li> 
</ul>
