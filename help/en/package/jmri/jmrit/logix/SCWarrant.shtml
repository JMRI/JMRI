<H1>Signal Controlled Warrants</H1>

A signal controlled warrant is the same as a <A HREF="Warrant.shtml">standard warrant</A>, except that it is 
specially suited for small layouts with short blocks.
<p>
A number of nice features in standard warrants have been sacrificed in signal controlled warrants for the sake of 
speedy and reliable control of small layouts. This includes speed ramping and the ability to control bells, whistles 
and light when the train enters a block.
<p>
Likewise a few features are introduced in signal controlled warrants that are not present in standard warrants.
<p>
First and foremost signal controlled warrants are controlled by signals. This obviously requires that you have defined 
signals - at least virtual signals - on your layout and that you have added those signals to your OPortals. If you have 
done that, the signal controlled warrant will constantly "look" at the next signal along it's route and adapt the speed 
of the train to the aspect shown by that signal. This speed adaptation happens promptly and no matter how often the 
aspect changes. Thereby the train will stop even within short blocks.
<p>
If you have slow moving turnouts on your layout, you have to protect each turnout with a signal. Otherwise a train 
might run through the turnout while it moves.
<p> 
An additional feature of signal controlled warrants is that it is possible to define a number of milliseconds that 
the train shall continue with low speed after it has entered the destination block. This is in part a substitute 
for the very flexible way standard warrants are able to execute throttle commands. But it is also a quite reliable 
way to make the train stop at the same location every time.
<p> 
One more requirement to your layout: Signal controlled warrants do not handle dark blocks. I.e. all those blocks 
you use in the route for a signal controlled warrant must be equipped with a sensor. I.e. the warrant must at all 
times have at least one sensor active (and thereby an OBlock occupied) while the signal controlled warrant is 
running a train.
<p>
Apart from standard and signal controlled warrants, a third type exists, namely eNtry-eXit warrants 
or <A HREF="NXWarrant.shtml">NXWarrants</A>

<H2>Creating and running a Signal Controlled Warrant</H2>
A Signal Controlled warrants are created and used in the same way as standard warrants. You may even switch back and 
forth between a signal controlled warrant and a standard warrant.
<p>
Simply choose the warrant type in the <A HREF="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">warrant editor</A>.
