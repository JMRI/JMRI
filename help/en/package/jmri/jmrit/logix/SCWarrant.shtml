      <h1>Signal Controlled Warrants</h1>A signal controlled
      warrant is the same as a <a href="Warrant.shtml">standard
      warrant</a>, except that it is specially suited for small
      layouts with short blocks.

      <p>A number of nice features in standard warrants have been
      sacrificed in signal controlled warrants for the sake of
      speedy and reliable control of small layouts. This includes
      speed ramping and the ability to control bells, whistles and
      light when the train enters a block.</p>

      <p>Likewise a few features are introduced in signal
      controlled warrants that are not present in standard
      warrants.</p>

      <p>First and foremost signal controlled warrants are
      controlled by signals. This obviously requires that you have
      defined signals - at least virtual signals - on your layout
      and that you have added those signals to your OPortals. If
      you have done that, the signal controlled warrant will
      constantly "look" at the next signal along it's route and
      adapt the speed of the train to the aspect shown by that
      signal. This speed adaptation happens promptly and no matter
      how often the aspect changes. Thereby the train will stop
      even within short blocks.</p>

      <p>If you have slow moving turnouts on your layout, you have
      to protect each turnout with a signal. Otherwise a train
      might run through the turnout while it moves.</p>

      <p>An additional feature of signal controlled warrants is
      that it is possible to define a number of milliseconds that
      the train shall continue with low speed after it has entered
      the destination block. This is in part a substitute for the
      very flexible way standard warrants are able to execute
      throttle commands. But it is also a quite reliable way to
      make the train stop at the same location every time.</p>

      <p>One more requirement to your layout: Signal controlled
      warrants do not handle dark blocks. I.e. all those blocks you
      use in the route for a signal controlled warrant must be
      equipped with a sensor. I.e. the warrant must at all times
      have at least one sensor active (and thereby an OBlock
      occupied) while the signal controlled warrant is running a
      train.</p>

      <p>Apart from standard and signal controlled warrants, a
      third type exists, namely eNtry-eXit warrants or <a href=
      "NXWarrant.shtml">NXWarrants</a></p>

      <h2>Creating and running a Signal Controlled Warrant</h2>A
      Signal Controlled warrants are created and used in the same
      way as standard warrants. You may even switch back and forth
      between a signal controlled warrant and a standard warrant.

      <p>Simply choose the warrant type in the <a href=
      "CreateEditWarrant.shtml">warrant editor</a>.
