<H1>The Occupancy Block Tables</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
The Occupancy Block Tables were developed to define the elements needed to create
"warrants" that allow trains to run automatically over predetermined routes.  It was
also a design goal to generate these routes 
automatically by merely specifying the origin and destination of the trains.  Furthermore,
it was designed for use by Logix so that users can define and control automated trains
running from panel editor panels of their own design.  
   
<H3>What are Portals and Why Use Them?</H3>
Occupancy blocks, or more properly named "track circuits", are portions of track having 
one or more sensors to detect occupancy of trains.  
These blocks, <b>OBlocks</b> are usually separated by gaps cut in the track which isolate the detecting
sensors.  However this is not always the case, since optical sensors might also be 
used to detect occupancy in a section of track.  Nevertheless whatever method is used
to determine a block and the means of detecting its occupancy, there is some point that
separates one block from another block.  This dividing line 
between two blocks, whether a physical gap or an imaginary line, marks a transition
from one block to another.  These transition points are 
called <b>Portals</b>.
</p>
<p> Undoubtably you created the blocks because it was important for
you to know when one section of track was exited and another was entered.  One or more 
track circuits might be grouped together to make a prototypical block, i.e. a section of track
whose use is governed by signals. This can
provide interlocking. The signals governing a block are logically placed at the portal 
points.  If you have signals on
your layout, consider where they are located.  Most likely they are placed near dividing 
points between blocks.  So regardless of the name, Portals are a significant concept.
</p>
<p>
<H3>Paths Through Portals</H3>
<p>There may be many ways to traverse a block.  A path within a block will enter at one portal 
and exit through another portal. Or a path may terminate within the block, that is, the path
is a spur.  Again, portals are a useful concept to indicate these entrance and exit points.
</p> 
<p>Note that a path must
have at least one portal for an entry/exit point and cannot have more than two portals.
A <b>Path</b> is unambiguously defined by specifying the turnouts and their settings for a
train to proceed safely through the block.
</p>
<p>
<H2>Definitions:</H2>
The Occupancy Tables define the following elements:
<UL>
	<LI> <b>Blocks</b> are implemented as JMRI OBlocks, which are extensions of 
        JMRI Blocks.  They have the following characteristics:
        <ul>
                <li>An OBlock has from 1 to N Portals.</li>
                <li>  Although an OBlock can be defined without a sensor, 
                i.e. a "Dark Block", it should have a sensor. If it
                has more than one sensor, these sensors should be 
                "OR"ed together and trigger a single internal sensor for the block.</li>
                <li> An OBlock has from 1 to M paths.</li>
                <li> An OBlock has 0 to K turnouts.</li> 
        </ul></LI>
        <LI><b>Portals</b> separate blocks.  They have the following characteristics:
        <ul>
                <li>A Portal has exactly two Blocks. (no more, no less)</li>
                <li>A portal may have 0 to 2 Signal masts.
                If a portal has a signal, it faces one of its blocks.  A second signal, 
                if it exists, faces the other block.  Each signal controls the movement of a train
                exiting the block it faces and thus the entrance of the train to other block.</li>
        </ul></LI>
        <LI><b>Paths</b> traverse a block. They are implemented as JMRI OPaths, which are 
        extensions of JMRI Paths.They have the following characteristics:
        <ul>
                <li>A Path has 0 to N turnouts.</li>
                <li>A path has at least one and no more than two portals.</li>
        </ul></LI>
</ul>
How OBlocks, Portals and Paths are used is described in the help file 
 <a href="../logix/Warrant.shtml"> Warrants. </a>. You may want to browse that before
 reading further.
 <p>
 OBlocks, Portals and OPaths can be created and edited by the using the methods described below,
 or they can also be created and edited from a WYSIWYG graphical interface described in
 <a href="..\display\Circuitbuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a>.</p>  Circuit Builder can be
 used you if you have a track diagram using track icons showing your layout.
 Otherwise you will need to use the tables below.  See 
 <a href="../logix/OBlockEdit.shtml"> Creating and Editing OBlocks, Portals and OPaths.</a>
for more details on using the tables.
 
<p>
<H2>Tables of the Occupancy Block, Portal, Path Frame</H2>
The tables defining these elements are contained within a single frame that can be
minimized or closed.  The individual table frames can be minimized within this parent
frame.
<p>
Each of the tables in the Occupancy Block, Portal, Path Frame have the last row with blank entries.  
Entering data into these entries and pressing the 'Enter' key will create a new item in the table.
'Drag and Drop' and 'Copy and Paste' are implemented to provide easy ways to move text from table to
table.
</p>
<p>
<H3>Columns in the Occupancy Block Table:</H3>
Each occupancy block on your layout should be entered as a row of this table.
<ul>
        <li><b>System Name</b>: The system name of the OBlock. The system letter 'O', and 
        type leter 'B' is used for for 'OBlock' although the implementation is not system-specific.
        If these letters are not entered they are automatically prepended.</li> 
        <li><b>User Name</b>: The user name of the OBlock. </li>
        <li><b>Comment</b>: You may enter any text in this field you wish.</li>
        <li><b>Sensor</b>:The sensor that detects occupancy of the block.</li>
        <li><b>Length</b>: The length of the Block.  This is an important parameter if you use NXWarrants.</li>
        <li><b>Units</b>: The unit used to determine the length. (inches or centimeters)
        <li><b>Curvature</b>: The curvature selected for the track  This is included for 
        compatibility with JMRI Blocks.</li>
        <li><b>Paths</b>: A button that opens the <b>Block-Path</b> table where the paths of 
        this block are entered.  This table is described below.
        <li><<b>Delete</b>: A button to delete the Block.  To make the deletion permanent, 
        save your configuration file to disk</li> 
</ul>
This table is sorted by the system name of the OBlock.  This means that when a new row is added
the entry will jump to its postion in the sort.  After entering a new OBlock you may find it
at the top of the window should you need to do further editing.

<H3>Columns in the Portal Table:</H3>
The Portal table has columns for the blocks it separates.  You do not need to be concerned
about the direction of travel through the portal.  <i>It does not matter which side of the portal the blocks names are
entered</i>, since the algorithms that compute train routes will decipher the correct
entrance and exit points.</p>
<ul>
        <li><b>Block Name</b>: The user or system name of the OBlock on one side of the Portal.</li>
        <li><b>Portal Name</b>: The portal name.  The names of portals must be unique.</li>
        <li><b>Block Name</b>: The user or system name of the OBlock on the other side of the Portal.</li>
        <li><<b>Delete</b>: A button to delete the Portal.  To make the deletion permanent, 
        save your configuration file to disk</li> 
</ul>
This table is sorted by the name of the Portal.  This means that when a new row is added
the entry will jump to its postion in the sort.  After entering a new Portal you may find it at 
the top of the window for further editing.</p>
<p>
<H3>Columns in Signal Table:</H3>
For each signal on your layout, make an entry in the Signal Table.  This signal will control the
actions of any warranted train - changing its speed according to the signal's indication when the
train reaches the portal where the signal is placed.  That is, the signal 'protects' the blocks beyond 
the portal. The signal may be either a <b>SignalMast</b> or a <b>SignalHead</b>.
<ul>
        <li><b>Signal Name</b>: Enter the name of the signal, either the system name or user name.
        (In the case where the same name is used for both a SignalMast and SignalHead, the SignalMast
        will be chosen.) </li>  
        <li><b>From (Approach) Block</b>: Enter the name, either system name or user name,
        of the block that the signal faces.  The signal controls the movement
        of a train exiting from the approach block and entering into the protected block.</li> 
        <li><b>(Through) Portal</b>: Enter the name of the portal where the signal is placed.</li>
        <li><b>To (Protected) Block</b>: Enter the name, either system name or user name,
        of the block whose entrance is protected by the signal.</li>
        <li><b>Delay(ms)</b>: (Optional) Enter the time in milliseconds to delay any speed change
        that may be required by the signal's aspect.  (See note below)</li>
</ul>
<p>        
<H3>How Signal Aspects Or Occupancy Change Speed:</H3>
The warrant detects the signal aspect when it enters the <i>approach</i> block and, if needed,
prepares to change the speed before it reaches the <i>protected</i> block.  Any speed change is
ramped down to the speed required by the signal.  The above <b>delay</b> time is the time the
warranted train will wait before beginning the speed change.</p>
<p>
Likewise, when the signal indicates a clear or improved speed from a stopped or reduced speed
condition, the speed will be ramped up to the allowed or recorded speed. 
<p>
<H3>Columns in Block-Path Tables:</H3>
Each block in the Occupancy Block Table will have one or more paths in it.  Pressing the <b>Paths</b> 
button in a row of the Occupancy Block Table will open this table.  <i>Direction of the path
is immaterial</i>.  'from' and 'to' do not have to correspond to any particular side
of the block.  They are just portal names for the path that traverses from 
'this portal' to 'that portal'.</p>
<ul>
        <li><b>From Portal</b>: The portal name of one enterance/exit point of the path.</li> 
        <li><b>Path Name</b>: The name of the Path.  Path names only have to be unique within
        the block.  E.g, "Westbound Main" could be used as the name in all the blocks of the 
        "Westbound Main" on your layput.</li>
        <li><b>To Portal Name</b>: The portal name of the other enterance/exit point of the path.</li>
        <li><b>Turnouts</b>: A button that opens the <b>Block-Path-Turnout</b> table where the turnouts 
        that define the path are entered.  This table is described below.
        <li><<b>Delete</b>: A button to delete the Path.  To make the deletion permanent, 
        save your configuration file to disk</li> 
</ul>
<p>
<H3>Columns in Block-Path-Turnout Tables:</H3>
If the path crosses a turnout, then it is necessary to have the turnout in the correct position
in order to traverse the path.  This table is used to define these settings.  (If the path does
not cross ant turnouts, this table is left empty.)  Note there will be lots of these tables, one
for each path in each block of the Occupancy Block Table.
<ul>
        <li><b>System/User Name</b>: The system or user name of the turnout in the path.</li> 
        <li><b>Turnout Setting</b>: the position of the turnout to make the path </li>
        <li><<b>Delete</b>: A button to delete the Turnout settings.  To make the deletion permanent, 
        save your configuration file to disk</li> 
</ul>
<p>
<H3>Columns in Block-Portal CrossReference Table:</H3>
This is a read only table to assist in identifying all the portals to a block.  It lists all
the portals that have been defined for each block, grouped under each block heading. It is opened
from the <b>Show Block-Portal CrossReference</b> menu item.  See below.
