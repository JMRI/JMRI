      <h1>Fast Reacting Warrants</h1>
      <p>This type of Warrant does not follow
      the <a href="Warrant.shtml">standard Prototypical Warrant</a>
      rules, but instead reacts to signals with an immediate
      speed change upon entering their approach block.<br>
      The throttle settings are a fixed proportion of the
      Aspect Speed Names in Warrant Preferences. It is specially
      adapted for small layouts with short blocks.<br>
      Apart from standard and Fast Reacting Warrants, a
      third type is eNtry-eXit or
      <a href="NXWarrant.shtml">NX Warrants</a></p>

      <p>A number of nice features in standard Warrants have been
      sacrificed in Fast Reacting Warrants for the sake of
      speedy and reliable control of small layouts. This includes
      disabling of speed ramping and the ability to control bells,
      whistles and light when the train enters a block.</p>

      <p>Likewise a few features available in Fast Reacting Warrants
      that are not present in standard Warrants.</p>

      <p>First and foremost Fast Reacting Warrants are
      controlled by signals (hence their technical name Signal
      Controlled (SC) Warrants). This obviously requires that you have
      defined signals - at least virtual signals - on your layout
      and that you have added those signals to your OPortals. If
      you have done that, the Fast Reacting Warrant will
      constantly "look" at the next signal along its route and
      adapt the speed of the train to the Aspect shown by that
      signal. This speed adaptation happens promptly and no matter
      how often the Aspect changes. Thereby the train will stop
      even within short blocks.</p>

      <p>Note: If you have slow moving turnouts on your layout,
      you have to protect each turnout with a signal. Otherwise
      a train might run through the turnout while it moves.</p>

      <p>An additional feature of Fast Reacting Warrants is
      that it is possible to define a number of milliseconds that
      the train shall continue with low speed after it has entered
      the destination block. This is in part a substitute for the
      very flexible way standard Warrants are able to execute
      throttle commands. But it is also a quite reliable way to
      make the train stop at the same location every time.</p>

      <p>One more requirement to your layout: Fast Reacting
      Warrants do not handle "dark" Blocks. I.e. all those Blocks
      you use in the route for a Fast Reacting Warrant must be
      equipped with an occupancy sensor. I.e. the Warrant must
      at all times have at least one sensor active (and thereby
      an OBlock occupied) while the Fast Reacting Warrant is
      running a train.</p>

      <h2>Creating and running a Fast Reacting Warrant</h2>
      <p>A Fast Reacting Warrant is created and used in the
      same way as standard Prototypical Warrants. You may even
      switch back and forth between a Fast Reacting Warrant
      and a standard Warrant.</p>

      <p>Simply change the Warrant type in the
      <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Warrant Editor</a>.</p>
