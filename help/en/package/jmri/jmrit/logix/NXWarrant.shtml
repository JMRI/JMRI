      <h1>NXWarrants</h1>An NXWarrant is a computer generated
      warrant. Rather than recording speed changes and other
      locomotive commands from a throttle where the recording notes
      the elapsed time between commands, an algorithm generates the
      speed changes and elapsed times for a smooth start up and
      slow down to a stop. To review information about warrants see
      <a href="Warrant.shtml">About Warrants</a>. In order to
      determine correct elapsed times and the blocks where the
      speed changes should occur, the block lengths must be known.
      Additionally, the proper scale must be known. Nevertheless,
      even if OBlock lengths are not specified, the algorithm makes
      a best effort to generate a usable warrant.

      <h2>Launching an NXWarrant</h2>After selecting the menu item
      <b>Create NX Warrant</b> from the <b>Warrants</b> menu of the
      Control Panel Editor, or by clicking on the <b>Create NX
      Warrant</b> button in the <b>Warrant List</b> window, the
      <b>Create eNtry/eXit Warrant</b> window is displayed.

      <h3>Set the Route</h3>First establish the route for the train
      by entering OBlocks in the following fields.

      <ul>
        <li>Choose an <b>Origin</b> block, a starting Path and
        Portal to exit the originating block.</li>

        <li>Choose a <b>Destination</b> block and a Path on which
        to end the route and Portal where is enters the block.</li>

        <li>(Optionally) Chose a <b>Via</b> block, that is, a block
        that route <i>must</i> include.</li>

        <li>(Optionally) Chose an <b>Avoid</b> block, that is, a
        block the the route <i>must not</i> include.</li>
      </ul>Blocks are chosen either by typing in the block name or
      dragging it from a displayed OBlock table. The origin and
      destination blocks can also be chosen by clicking on track
      icons that represent these OBlocks. To use this feature your
      panel must have your layout depicted by Indicator Track Icons
      placed there by Circuit builder.

      <p>To specify a warrant route by mouse clicks, simply click
      on a track icon. The mouse clicks move successively through
      the Block Name fields of the Create eNtry/eXit Warrant
      window. If you mis-clicked on an icon and/or want to change
      the block in one of the fields, just double-click the field
      and click on another icon. Note, the icons <i>must</i> be
      Indicator Track Icons.</p>

      <p>A computer algorithm determines all the intermediate
      blocks and paths to make the route. If more than one route
      meets the criterion, you are presented with a list to review
      and select the route you want. Note, the Via and Avoid
      location fields may be used to restrict the list.</p>

      <p>Another parameter to use in specifying a warrant route is
      the <b>Max Number of Blocks in Route</b> field at the bottom
      of the window. This number puts an upper limit on the length
      of the route the algorithm computes. If your layout contains
      loops, then an infinite number of routes can be be counted.
      To minimize computation time, you need not use a number that
      is much larger than the number of blocks in the longest
      route. <i>However, using too small a number can terminate the
      search prematurely before the route is found.</i></p>

      <h3>The Script Algorithm</h3>The NX warrant script sets the
      direction, turns the light on, blows two horn/whistle blasts
      and starts to ramp up speed. It is highly desirable to have a
      reasonable estimate for block length entered for each OBlock,
      but not absolutely necessary. If the length of the route is
      known, the algorithm will ramp up to the last speed that
      allows enough room to ramp down to a stop in the last block.
      After stopping in the last block the script blows one
      horn/whistle blast and turns off the light.

      <p>The algorithm calculates the speed changes assuming the
      train starts at the middle of the Origin block and stops at
      the middle of the Destination block. If the starting block or
      ending block has length 0, it will assume literally that its
      length is zero and will only do one speed setting in the
      block, i.e. at the start set the minimum speed or at the end
      set the speed to 0. If any of the intermediate blocks have
      length 0, the algorithm assumes the length is long enough to
      complete a full ramp up or ramp down. So while not necessary,
      it is advisable to enter block lengths on the <b>OBlock
      Table</b> at <i>Add Item-&gt;Occupancy Blocks</i>.</p>

      <p>A further parameter the algorithm needs to know is the
      scale. Choose the correct scale of your layout by selecting
      it from the Preferences Warrants panel. The warrants panel at
      <i>Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</i> is where this and
      other warrant parameters can be edited.</p>

      <h3>Set the Algorithm Parameters</h3>At the bottom of the
      NXWarrant window are the following items.

      <ul>
        <li><b>Max number of blocks in route</b> Maximum number of
        blocks the route algorithm should go before stopping.</li>

        <li><b>Max Throttle Setting</b> - Throttle setting for the
        top speed the warrant will reach.</li>

        <li><b>Ramp Step Interval Time</b> - Throttle setting for
        the first speed step when starting. (Default from
        Preferences Warrant panel, but can be modified for this
        NXWarrant only.)</li>

        <li><b>Ramp Step Throttle Increment</b> - Throttle setting
        for the first speed step when starting and each speed step
        until the Max Throttle Setting is reached. (Default from
        Preferences Warrant panel, but can be modified for this
        NXWarrant only.)</li>
      </ul>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        The above labels for the throttle settings depend upon the
        Speed Name interpretation at
        <i>Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</i> and could be, for
        example, <b>Max Scale speed Mph</b> and <b>Ramp Speed
        Increment Mph</b>.
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Train Name</b> - Indicator Track icons set to
        display train names will show this name when the train
        occupies the OBlock the icon represents. If left blank, the
        locomotive address is displayed.</li>

        <li><b>Engine Roster</b> - Pick a train from the Roster
        from this drop down combo box. The locomotive address and
        train id will be displayed.</li>

        <li><b>Address</b> - The decoder address of the locomotive
        of the train. This is a required field.</li>
      </ul>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        Note, when editing a Indicator Track Icon (<i>Edit
        Indicator Track</i> popup.)there is a <b>Display Train Name
        when occupied</b> check box in the edit dialog.
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>Radio buttons <b>Forward</b> and <b>Reverse</b> Set the
        direction of the locomotive.</li>
      </ul>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <i><b>It is important to set this correctly.</b></i>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>Checkbox <b>EStop at Destination Block</b> Emergency
        stop the train upon entering the last block. <i>Rarely
        Needed.</i></li>

        <li>Checkbox <b>Halt Start at Origin Block</b> Allocate and
        set the warrant, but don't start the train until the user
        issues a <b>Resume</b> command to the warrant from the
        Warrant List Table or via a Logix Warrant Control
        action.</li>

        <li>Checkbox <b>Compute Throttle Factor</b> Calculate a
        Speed Profile throttle factor during this NXWarrant
        run.</li>
      </ul>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        A Via Location must be specified before running the
        warrant. See the section below for details.
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>Buttons <b>Run NX Warrant</b> and <b>Cancel</b></li>

        <li>Radio buttons <b>Run Auto</b> for an automated warrant.
        and <b>Run Manual</b> to dispatch a route for a manual
        operator</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Running the Warrant</h3>Pressing the <b>Run NX
      Warrant</b> button computes the route and runs the addressed
      train at the specified speeds and direction. If more than one
      route meets the criterion, you are presented with a list to
      review and select the route you want. The Via and Avoid
      location fields may be used to restrict the list.

      <h3>Calculate a Speed Profile Throttle Factor</h3>When the
      <b>Compute Throttle Factor</b> checkbox is selected running
      the warrant will compute Speed Profile throttle factor. The
      "Via" block is used as a speed trap to determine the track
      speed and compare it to the throttle setting. When the Via
      block is crossed the warrant will report the speed and
      Throttle Factor. The Factor can then be saved into the Speed
      Profile to be used in any warrant where this engine address
      is used.

      <p>Choose a Via block of accurate length, reasonably long,
      where the train can fully reach the maximum speed set and
      exit the block before ramping down. Generally the factors
      calculated for the mid and high ranges of speed are
      relatively constant. Typically, the factors diverge at slow
      speeds. For a given throttle setting, Speed Profile factors
      can vary due to temperature changes, consist load and other
      conditions. Getting reproducible factors from day to day
      within 10 to 15 percent is satisfactory.</p>

      <h3>Saving NXWarrants to make them Permanently Saved</h3>If
      you press the <b>Edit</b> button on the Warrant List Table of
      the NXwarrant while it is still executing, the Create/Edit
      Warrant Window for the NXWarrant will open. Use the
      <b>Copy</b> button to make a permanent warrant that can be
      edited later.

      <h3>Some Tips for Smooth Start Up and Slow Down</h3>It is
      good practice to have a length specified for each block. A
      rough estimate is better than letting it be 0. If the second
      block has length 0 any remaining speed steps not done in the
      starting block will be put in that block. Lengths can be set
      for individual paths within a block in the CircuitBuilder
      should that be desirable.

      <p>If the next to last block has length 0 you should input
      its length, so the algorithm can start the ramp down in the
      previous block (block before the next-to-last). Although a
      zero length last block will set speed to 0 immediately,
      momentum could cause the train to overrun if the next-to-last
      block hasn't completed the ramp down. Or in this case, use
      the E-stop option, but that could be rather abrupt.</p>

      <p>For a series of short blocks with length specified the
      ramp up and ramp down is distributed over the blocks as
      needed. Also, for short routes, the algorithm calculates only
      enough ramp up so the ramp down can finish without
      overrunning the last block.</p>

      <p>The script's block synchronization will adjust the the
      elapsed times. <b>Note!</b> if the route includes a
      <i>Dark</i> block, i.e. no occupancy detection, it is very
      important it's block length is known since in this case,
      synchronization cannot be done.</p>

      <p>For locos with no momentum, short times make smoother
      ramps. For locos with lots of momentum, longer periods should
      be used. The defaults are set for a modest amount of
      momentum, i.e. perhaps less than prototype but visually OK.
      Observe how the train behaves and adjust accordingly.</p>
