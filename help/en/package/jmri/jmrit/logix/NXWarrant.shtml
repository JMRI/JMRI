      <h1>Warrants: NX Warrants</h1>

      <p>An NX Warrant is a computer generated Warrant. Rather than recording speed changes and
      other locomotive commands from a throttle where the recording notes the elapsed time between
      commands, an algorithm generates the speed changes and elapsed times for a smooth start up
      and slow down to a stop. To review information about Warrants see <a href=
      "Warrant.shtml">About Warrants</a>.<br>
      In is necessary to know the Block Path lengths and the engine's speed characteristics in
      order to determine correct time and position for where the speed changes should occur. A
      speed profile for the selected engine/consist to provide track speeds is desirable. Lacking a
      speed profile, the <em>Throttle Factor</em> and <em>Layout Scale</em> are used for a rough
      estimate of track speed. If block lengths are not specified, you will be prompted to provide
      a length. <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">When Warrant Speeds Are Modified</a> profides more
      details about how Warrants modify recorded speeds.</p>

      <h2>Launching an NX Warrant</h2>

      <p>After selecting the menu item <strong>Create NX Warrant</strong> from the
      <strong>Warrants</strong> menu of the Control Panel Editor, or by clicking on the
      <strong>Create NX Warrant</strong> button in the <strong>Warrant List</strong> window, the
      <strong>Create eNtry/eXit Warrant</strong> window is displayed:</p>
      <a href="images/NxWarrantCreate1.png"><img src="images/NxWarrantCreate1.png" class=
      "floatRight" width="547" height="347" alt="Warrants Preferences pane in in JMRI 4.10"></a>
      <h3>Set the Route</h3>

      <p>First establish the route for the train by entering OBlocks in the following fields:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Choose an <strong>Origin</strong> block, a starting Path and Portal to exit the
        originating block.</li>

        <li>Choose a <strong>Destination</strong> block and a Path on which to end the route and
        Portal where is enters the block.</li>

        <li>(Optionally) Chose a <strong>Via</strong> block, that is, a block that route
        <em>must</em> include.</li>

        <li>(Optionally) Chose an <strong>Avoid</strong> block, that is, a block the route <em>must
        not</em> include.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Blocks are chosen either by typing in the block name or dragging it from a displayed
      OBlock table (use the <strong>OBlock Pick List</strong> button). The origin and destination
      blocks can also be chosen by clicking on track icons that represent these OBlocks. To use
      this feature your panel must have your layout depicted by Indicator Track Icons placed there
      by <a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a>.</p>

      <p>To specify a Warrant route by mouse clicks, simply click on a track icon on your Control
      Panel. The mouse clicks move successively through the Block Name fields of the Create
      eNtry/eXit Warrant pane. If you mis-clicked on an icon and/or want to change the block in one
      of the fields, just double-click the field and click on another icon.<br>
      Note that the icons <em>must</em> be Indicator Track Icons to have this feature. <a href=
      "CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and Editing Warrants</a> also discusses choosing
      routes.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Max Number of Blocks in Route</strong> field puts an upper limit on the length
      of the route the algorithm computes. If your layout contains loops, then an infinite number
      of routes can theoretically be counted. To minimize computation time, you need not use a
      number that is much larger than the number of blocks in the longest route. <em>However, using
      too small a number can terminate the search prematurely before the route is found.</em></p>

      <p>Pressing the <strong>Calculate</strong> button runs a computer algorithm to determine all
      the intermediate blocks and paths to make the route. If more than one route meets the
      criterion, you are presented with a list to review and select the route you want. Note, the
      Via and Avoid location fields may be used to restrict the list. Possibly you will be
      presented with a dialog stating that no route could be found. You can view a tree of all the
      possible searches the algorithm used to find the route. Typical errors are the Portals of the
      selected paths are mismatched for exit and entry. Also check that the paths have the needed
      portals for exit and entry.</p>

      <p>Once the route has been chosen, the window changes to show choices for the running
      parameters of the NX Warrant:<br>
      <a href="images/NxWarrantCreate2.png"><img src="images/NxWarrantCreate2.png" class=
      "floatRight" width="591" height="330" alt=
      "Warrants Preferences pane in in JMRI 4.10"></a></p>

      <h3>Set the Run Parameters</h3>

      <p>The required fields are <strong>Address</strong> and <strong>Max Throttle
      Setting</strong>. All the others are optional or have defaults.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Train Name</strong> - Indicator Track icons set to display train names will
        show this name when the train occupies the OBlock the icon represents. If left blank, the
        locomotive address or Roster Id is displayed.</li>

        <li><strong>Engine Roster</strong> - Pick a train from the Roster from this drop down combo
        box. The locomotive address and train id will be displayed.</li>

        <li><strong>Address</strong> - The decoder address of the locomotive of the train. This is
        a required field, but it will be displayed automatically if a train is selected from the
        roster. You may enter the DCC address of a non-Roster locomotive.</li>
      </ul>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        Note, when editing a Indicator Track Icon (<em>Edit Indicator Track</em> popup.) there is a
        <strong>Display Train Name when occupied</strong> check box in the edit dialog. When
        checked the icon will display the <em>Train Name</em> field entered above.
      </div>

      <p>The <strong>View Speed Profile</strong> button displays a table of the track speeds that
      will be used in the calculations for the Warrant. The table is comprised of the Roster Speed
      Profile merged with any speed measurements that have been made during the current session. If
      the table is empty, the values for Throttle Factor and Layout Scale in <a href=
      "#prefs">Warrant Preferences</a> are used in the calculations. (Note, this was the only way
      it was done prior to Release 4.9.2.)</p>

      <p>Next set values for the maximum speed the train should achieve when track conditions are
      at a <em>Clear</em> aspect.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Max Throttle setting</strong> Percent of full Throttle. Invalid entries will be
        discarded.</li>

        <li><strong>Scale Speed</strong> or <strong>Track speed</strong> - The label depends upon
        the units you choose to express the train's speed. The "<em><strong>units"</strong></em>
        button cycles through the choices: Miles per hour, Kilometers per hour, millimeters per
        second, inches per second. If a speed profile exists. it is used to make the conversion to
        throttle setting percent. Otherwise the throttle factor settings of Warrant Preferences are
        used.</li>

        <li><strong>Start Distance</strong> is the position of the train in the Origin block. Set
        the distance of the train's position to the exit portal of the origin block. You may choose
        either inches or centimeters for units.</li>

        <li><strong>End Distance</strong> is the position where the train should stop in the
        Destination block. Set the distance from the entry portal of the destination block to the
        desired stop point. You may choose either inches or centimeters for units.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>NXWarrants ramp up and ramp down the train speed in increments to provide a prototypical
      appearance when leaving the Origin block and ending in the Destination block. The parameters
      for the increments to use are set by the <strong>Ramp Step Time</strong> and <strong>Ramp
      Step Throttle</strong> fields.</p>

      <p>Next, set the direction of travel. <em><strong>It is important to set this
      correctly</strong></em> because the throttle commands will correspond to track conditions. Be
      ready to issue an <strong>Abort</strong> command from Warrant List Table if this occurs.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Radio buttons <strong>Forward</strong> and <strong>Reverse</strong> Set the direction
        of the locomotive.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>On the right is a list of some options to consider for running the warrant.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The checkbox <strong>Don't Ramp Speed changes</strong> Sets an option on how to change
        the speed when a signal or rogue occupation is detected ahead. The default is to
        incrementally slow the train before reaching the end of the approach block. Selecting the
        option will make an immediate speed change upon entering the approach block.</li>

        <li>The checkbox <strong>Skip Sound Commands</strong> Sounding the horn or whistle at the
        start and end of the NXWarrant are eliminated.</li>

        <li>The checkbox <strong>EStop at Destination Block</strong> to have the train make an
        emergency stop upon entering the last block. <em>Rarely Needed.</em></li>

        <li>The checkbox <strong>Halt Start at Origin Block</strong> will allocate and set the
        Warrant, but won't start the train until you issue a <strong>Resume</strong> command to the
        Warrant from the Warrant List Table or via a Logix Warrant Control action.</li>

        <li>The checkbox <strong>Clearance to Share Route</strong> will allow another Warrant to
        acquire clearance to run ahead of the Warrant. The additional Warrant will cause this
        Warrant to halt and wait for occupation to clear ahead before resuming speed.</li>

        <li>The checkbox <strong>Add Tracker after run completes</strong> launches a tracker marker
        to follow the manual operation of the train after the warrant has finished.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>An NX Warrant can be issued for a manual operator. Here the route is allocated but no
      throttle commands are issued. The operator must acquire the throttle and drive the train.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Radio button <strong>Run Auto</strong> launches the Automated Warrant</li>

        <li><strong>Run Manual</strong> allocates and sets the route for a manual operator. This is
        similar to setting a Tracker where the route is prescribed and highlighted on the
        layout.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At the bottom of the pane are three buttons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Edit Route</strong> to return to the choose route window.</li>

        <li><strong>Run NX Warrant</strong> to allocate and run the Warrant</li>

        <li><strong>Cancel</strong> to discard entries and close window.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Script Algorithm</h3>
      The NX Warrant script sets the direction, turns the light on, blows two horn/whistle blasts
      and starts to ramp up speed. There should be a reasonable estimate for block length know for
      each OBlock. If the length of the route is not known, you will be prompted to enter a length
      for the path through the block. The algorithm will ramp up to the maximum speed and ramp down
      to a stop in the last block. After stopping in the last block, the script blows one
      horn/whistle blast and turns off the light.
      <p>For a series of short blocks the length needed to ramp up or ramp down is distributed over
      as many blocks as are needed. For short routes, the algorithm may decide the maximum speed
      cannot be achieved without over-running the last block. In this case, the max throttle
      setting is modified so ramp up and ramp down can finish without over-running the last
      block.</p>

      <p>The elapsed times to traverse each block is computed from what is known about the engine's
      speed profile and the length of the path in each block. <strong>Note!</strong> if the route
      includes a <em>Dark</em> block, i.e. no occupancy detection, it is important it's block
      length is known since in this case, synchronization cannot be done.</p>

      <h3>Saving NX Warrants to make them Permanent</h3>
      When the <strong>Run NX Warrant</strong> button is pressed and the NXWarrant starts its run,
      the warrant is listed in the Warrant List table with the name
      <strong>NX(</strong><em>address</em><strong>)</strong>. If the table is not visible, it will
      be displayed. Notice that the <strong>Edit</strong> button label for the warrant is
      <strong>Save</strong>.
      <p>If you press this button before the warrant completes, a Create/Edit Warrant Window for
      the NX Warrant will open. This window has a copy of the NXWarrant. After providing a name and
      any other information you want changed, press the <strong>Save</strong> button to make a
      permanent warrant.</p>

      <h3>Some Tips for Smooth Start Up and Slow Down</h3>

      <p>It is necessary to have a length specified for each path in a block. A rough estimate
      within 5% of the actual length is adequate. Each path inherits the length specified for the
      block, so it is only important to input a separate length for a path when its length is
      significantly less than the block length. Lengths can be set for OBlocks and for individual
      paths within a block in the CircuitBuilder Edit Path menu or in the OBlock tables.</p>

      <p>The algorithm calculates the speed changes using the the step intervals for time and
      throttle setting specified in Warrant Preferences. These are the values that give a
      prototypical look when changing speeds for signal aspects and starting and stopping. The
      Warrants pane at <em>Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</em> is where this and other Warrant
      parameters can be set.</p>

      width="629" height="428" alt="Warrants Preferences pane in in JMRI 4.10"></a>
      <h2 id="prefs">Warrant Preferences</h2>

      <p>From the general JMRI Preferences, select the Warrants tab and check the options set
      for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Layout Scale</strong> - Setting the modeling scale of your layout is essential
        so conversion to scale speeds is correct.</li>

        <li>The default search depth (<strong>Max. Number of Blocks in Route</strong>) as mentioned
        above when looking for routes.</li>

        <li>The value of the <strong>Throttle Setting/Speed Factor</strong> is used by Warrants
        when no Speed Profile is available.</li>

        <li><strong>Ramp Step time increment</strong> and <strong>Ramp Step Throttle
        Increment</strong> regulate the smoothness and prototypical look of speed changes.<br>
        For locos with no momentum, short times and smaller throttle increments make smoother
        ramps. For locomotives/consists with lots of momentum, longer periods should be used.<br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The throttle increment for one step of a 128 step throttle is
        0.00794. The defaults are set for a modest amount of momentum, i.e. perhaps less than
        prototype but visually OK. Observe how trains behave starting up and stopping with NX
        Warrants and adjust accordingly.</li>
