      <h1>NXWarrants</h1>An NXWarrant is a computer generated
      warrant. Rather than recording speed changes and other
      locomotive commands from a throttle where the recording notes
      the elapsed time between commands, an algorithm generates the
      speed changes and elapsed times for a smooth start up and
      slow down to a stop. To review information about warrants see
      <a href="Warrant.shtml">About Warrants</a>. In is necessary to
      know the block path lengths and the engine's speed characteristics
      in order to determine correct time and position for where the
      speed changes should occur.
      A speed profile for the selected engine/consist
      to provide track speeds is desirable.  Lacking a speed profile,
      the <i>Throttle Factor</i> and <i>Layout Scale</i> are used
      for a rough estimate of track speed. If block lengths are not  
      specified, you will be prompted to provide a length.
      <a href="SpeedChanges.shtml">When Warrant Speeds Are Modified</a>
      has details about how warrants modify recorded speeds.

      <h2>Launching an NXWarrant</h2>After selecting the menu item
      <b>Create NX Warrant</b> from the <b>Warrants</b> menu of the
      Control Panel Editor, or by clicking on the <b>Create NX
      Warrant</b> button in the <b>Warrant List</b> window, the
      <b>Create eNtry/eXit Warrant</b> window is displayed.

      <h3>Set the Route</h3>First establish the route for the train
      by entering OBlocks in the following fields.

      <ul>
        <li>Choose an <b>Origin</b> block, a starting Path and
        Portal to exit the originating block.</li>

        <li>Choose a <b>Destination</b> block and a Path on which
        to end the route and Portal where is enters the block.</li>

        <li>(Optionally) Chose a <b>Via</b> block, that is, a block
        that route <i>must</i> include.</li>

        <li>(Optionally) Chose an <b>Avoid</b> block, that is, a
        block the the route <i>must not</i> include.</li>
      </ul>Blocks are chosen either by typing in the block name or
      dragging it from a displayed OBlock table 
      (use the <b>OBlock Pick List</b> button). The origin and
      destination blocks can also be chosen by clicking on track
      icons that represent these OBlocks. To use this feature your
      panel must have your layout depicted by Indicator Track Icons
      placed there by Circuit builder.

      <p>To specify a warrant route by mouse clicks, simply click
      on a track icon. The mouse clicks move successively through
      the Block Name fields of the Create eNtry/eXit Warrant
      window. If you mis-clicked on an icon and/or want to change
      the block in one of the fields, just double-click the field
      and click on another icon. Note, the icons <i>must</i> be
      Indicator Track Icons to have this feature.
      <a href="CreateEditWarrant.shtml">Creating and
      Editing Warrants</a> also discusses choosing routes.</p>

      <p>The <b>Max Number of Blocks in Route</b> field puts an 
      upper limit on the length
      of the route the algorithm computes. If your layout contains
      loops, then an infinite number of routes can be be counted.
      To minimize computation time, you need not use a number that
      is much larger than the number of blocks in the longest
      route. <i>However, using too small a number can terminate the
      search prematurely before the route is found.</i></p>
      
      <p>Pressing the <b>Calculate</b> button runs a computer 
      algorithm to determine all the intermediate
      blocks and paths to make the route. If more than one route
      meets the criterion, you are presented with a list to review
      and select the route you want. Note, the Via and Avoid
      location fields may be used to restrict the list. Possibly
      you will be presented with a dialog stating that no route 
      could be found.  You can view a tree of all the possible 
      searches the algorithm used to find the route.  Typical 
      errors are the portals of the selected paths are mismatched 
      for exit and entry. Also check that the paths have the 
      needed portals for exit and entry.</p>

      <p>Once the route has been chosen, the window changes to
      show choices for the running parameters of the NXWarrant.</p>

      <h3>Set the Run Parameters</h3>
      The required fields are <b>Address</b> and <b>Max Throttle 
      Setting</b>. All the others are optional or have defaults.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Train Name</b> - Indicator Track icons set to
        display train names will show this name when the train
        occupies the OBlock the icon represents. If left blank, the
        locomotive address or Roster Id is displayed.</li>

        <li><b>Engine Roster</b> - Pick a train from the Roster
        from this drop down combo box. The locomotive address and
        train id will be displayed.</li>

        <li><b>Address</b> - The decoder address of the locomotive
        of the train. This is a required field, but it will be 
        displayed automatically if a train is selected from the roster.
        You may enter the DCC address of a non-Roster locomotive.</li>
      </ul>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        Note, when editing a Indicator Track Icon (<i>Edit
        Indicator Track</i> popup.) there is a <b>Display Train Name
        when occupied</b> check box in the edit dialog. When checked
        the icon will display the <i>Train Name</i> field entered above.
      </div>

      <p>The <b>View Speed Profile</b> button displays a table of the
      track speeds that will be used in the calculations for the 
      warrant.  The table is comprised of the Roster Speed Profile
      merged with any speed measurements that have been made during
      the current session.  If the table is empty, the values for
      Throttle Factor and Layout Scale in Warrant Preferences are
      used in the calculations. (Note, this was the only way it was
      done prior to Release 4.9.2.)</p>

      <p>Next set values for the maximum speed the train should achieve
      when track conditions are at a <i>Clear</i> aspect.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Max Throttle setting</b> must be a positive decimal
        not greater than 1.0</li>

        <li><b>Scale Speed</b> If a speed profile exists, you may enter
        maximum scale speed you want and the speed profile will set
        the maximum throttle setting. You may choose either Miles 
        per hour or Kilometers per hour.</li>
        
        <li><b>Start Distance</b> is the position of the train in
        the Origin block. Set the distance of the train's position
        to the exit portal of the origin block. You may choose 
        either inches or centimeters for units.</li>
        
        <li><b>End Distance</b> is the position where the train
        should stop in the Destination block. Set the distance 
        from the entry portal of the destination block to the
        desired stop point. You may choose either inches or 
        centimeters for units.</li>
      </ul>
 
      Next set the direction of travel.  <i><b>It is important to 
      set this correctly</b></i> because the throttle commands will
      correspond to track conditions.  Be ready to issue an
      <b>Abort</b> command from Warrant List Table if this occurs.   
      <ul>
        <li>Radio buttons <b>Forward</b> and <b>Reverse</b> Set the
        direction of the locomotive.</li>
        <li>A checkbox <b>Don't Ramp Speed changes</b> Sets an
        option on how to change the speed when a signal or rogue
        occupation is detected ahead. The default is to incrementally 
        slow the train before reaching the end of the approach block. 
        Selecting the option will make an immediate speed change upon 
        entering the approach block.</li>
      </ul>

      Lastly, there some options for running.
      <ul>
        <li>The checkbox <b>EStop at Destination Block</b> to make 
        an emergency stop the train upon entering the last 
        block. <i>Rarely Needed.</i></li>

        <li>The checkbox <b>Halt Start at Origin Block</b> will 
        allocate and
        set the warrant, but won't start the train until you
        issues a <b>Resume</b> command to the warrant from the
        Warrant List Table or via a Logix Warrant Control
        action.</li>
        
        <li>The checkbox <b>Clearance to Share Route</b> will allow
        another warrant to acquire clearance to run ahead of
        the warrant.  The additional warrant will cause this warrant
        to halt and wait for occupation to clear ahead before
        remuning speed.</li>
      </ul>

      An NXWarrant can be issued for a manual operator. Here the 
      route is allocated but no throttle commands are issued. The
      operator must acquire the throttle and drive the train.

      <ul>
        <li>Radio buttons <b>Run Auto</b> for an automated warrant.
        and <b>Run Manual</b> to dispatch a route for a manual
        operator</li>
      </ul>

      The buttons at the bottom are:

      <ul>
        <li><b>Edit Route</b> to return to the choose route window.</li>
        <li><b>Run NX Warrant</b> to allocate and run the warrant</li>
        <li><b>Cancel</b> to discard entries and close window.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Script Algorithm</h3>
      The NX warrant script sets the
      direction, turns the light on, blows two horn/whistle blasts
      and starts to ramp up speed. There should be a
      reasonable estimate for block length know for each OBlock. 
      If the length of the route is not known, you will be prompted 
      to enter a length for the path through the block.
      The algorithm will ramp up to the maximum speed and
      ramp down to a stop in the last block.
      After stopping in the last block the script blows one
      horn/whistle blast and turns off the light.

      <p>For a series of short blocks the length needed to
      ramp up or ramp down is distributed over as many blocks as
      are needed. For short routes, the algorithm may decide the
      maximum speed cannot be achieved without over-running the 
      last block. In this case, the max throttle setting is
      modified so ramp up and ramp down can finish without
      over-running the last block.</p>

      <p>The warrant's block synchronization adjusts the 
      elapsed times so event time are relative to the entry
      of the block. <b>Note!</b> if the route includes a
      <i>Dark</i> block, i.e. no occupancy detection, it is 
      important it's block length is known since in this case,
      synchronization cannot be done.</p>

      <h3>Saving NXWarrants to make them Permanently Saved</h3>If
      you press the <b>Edit</b> button on the Warrant List Table of
      the NXwarrant while it is still executing, the Create/Edit
      Warrant Window for the NXWarrant will open. Press the
      <b>Copy</b> button. After providing a name for the copy
      press <b>Save</b> to make a permanent warrant that can be
      edited later.

      <h3>Some Tips for Smooth Start Up and Slow Down</h3>It is
      necessary to have a length specified for each path in a 
      block. A rough estimate within 5% of the actual length 
      is adequate. Each path inherits the the length specified
      for the block, so it is only important to input a separate
      length for a path when its length is significantly less
      than the block length. Lengths can be set for OBlocks and
      for individual paths within a block in the CircuitBuilder
      Edit Path menu or in the OBlock tables.

      <p>The algorithm calculates the speed changes using the
      the step intervals for time and throttle setting 
      specified in Warrant Preferences. These are the values
      that give a prototypical look when changing speeds for 
      signal aspects and starting and stopping. The warrants panel at
      <i>Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Warrants</i> is where this and
      other warrant parameters can be edited.</p>

      <h4>Warrant Preferences Settings</h4>
      <b>Ramp Step time</b> and <b>Ramp Step Throttle Incr</b>
      regulate the smoothness and prototypical look of speed changes.
      For locos with no momentum, short times and smaller throttle
      increments make smoother ramps. For locomotives/consists 
      with lots of momentum, longer periods should
      be used. Note: The throttle increment for one step of a
      128 step throttle is 0.00794. The defaults are set for 
      a modest amount of
      momentum, i.e. perhaps less than prototype but visually OK.
      Observe how trains behave starting up and stopping with  
      NXWarrants and adjust accordingly.

      <p>Warrant Preferences is where the <b>Layout Scale</b> of your layout
      should be set.  This is needed so conversion to scale speeds
      is correct. The default for the search depth (<b>Max Num 
      Blocks in Route</b>) as mentioned
      above when looking for routes can be set here also. The value
      of the <b>Throttle Setting/Speed Factor</b> is used when no speed 
      profile is available.</p>
