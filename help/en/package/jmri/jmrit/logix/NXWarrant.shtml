<h1>NXWarrants</h1>

An NXWarrant is a computer generated warrant.  Rather than recording speed changes and other locomotive commands from a
throttle where the recording notes the elapsed time between commands, an algorithm generates the speed changes and 
elapsed times for a smooth start up and slow down to a stop. To review information about warrants see
<a href="Warrant.shtml">About Warrants</a>. 
In order to determine correct elapsed times and the blocks where the speed changes 
should occur, the block lengths must be known.  Additionally, the proper scale must be known.  Nevertheless, even
if OBlock lengths are not specified, the algorithm makes a best effort to generate a usable warrant.
<p>
<h2>Launching an NXWarrant</h2>
After selecting the menu item <b>Create NX Warrant</b> from the <b>Warrants</b> menu of the Control Panel Editor,
or by clicking on the <b>Create NX Warrant</b> button in the <b>Warrant List</b> window, the 
<b>Create eNtry/eXit Warrant</b> window is displayed.  
<h3>Set the Route</h3>
First establish the route for the train by entering OBlocks in the following fields.
<ul>
	<li>Choose an <b>Origin</b> block, a starting Path and Portal to exit the originating block.</li>
	<li>Choose a <b>Destination</b> block and a Path on which to end the route and Portal where is enters the block.</li>
	<li>(Optionally) Chose a <b>Via</b> block, that is, a block that route <i>must</i> include.</li>
	<li>(Optionally) Chose an <b>Avoid</b> block, that is, a block the the route <i>must not</i> include.</li>
</ul>
Blocks are chosen either by typing in the block name or dragging it from a displayed 
OBlock table.  The origin and destination blocks can also be chosen by clicking on track
icons that represent these OBlocks.  To use this feature your panel must have your layout
depicted by Indicator Track Icons placed there by Circuit builder.
<p>
To specify a warrant route by mouse clicks, simply click on a track icon.  The mouse clicks move successively through
the Block Name fields of the Create eNtry/eXit Warrant window.  If you mis-clicked on an icon and/or want to change the
block in one of the fields, just double-click the field and click on another icon.  Note, the icons <i>must</i> be 
Indicator Track Icons.
<p>
A computer algorithm determines all the intermediate blocks and paths to make the route.  If more
than one route meets the criterion, you are presented with a list to review and select the 
route you want.  Note, the Via and Avoid location fields may be used to restrict the list.
<p>
Another parameter to use in specifying a warrant route is the <b>Max Number of Blocks in Route</b> field at the 
bottom of the window.  This number puts an upper limit on the length of the route the algorithm computes.  If
your layout contains loops, then an infinite number of routes can be be counted.  To minimize computation time,
you need not use a number that is much 
larger than the number of blocks in the longest route. <i>However, using too small a number can terminate the
search prematurely before the route is found.</i> 
<p>
<h3>The Script Algorithm</h3>
The NX warrant script sets the direction, turns the light on, blows two horn/whistle blasts and starts to 
ramp up speed.  It is highly desirable to have a reasonable estimate for block length entered for each OBlock,
but not absolutely necessary.  If the length of the route is known, the algorithm will ramp up to the last 
speed that allows enough room to ramp down to a stop in the last block.  After stopping in the last block 
the script blows one horn/whistle blast and turns off the light.
<p>
The algorithm calculates the speed changes assuming the train starts at the middle of the Origin block and 
stops at the middle of the Destination block.  If the starting block or ending block has length 0, it will assume 
literally that its length is zero and will only do one speed setting in the block, i.e. at the start set the minimum
speed or at the end set the speed to 0.  If any of the intermediate blocks have length 0, the algorithm assumes
the length is long enough to complete a full ramp up or ramp down.  So while not necessary, it is advisable to
enter block lengths on the <b>OBlock Table</b> at <i>Add Item->Occupancy Blocks</i>.
<p>
A further parameter the algorithm needs to know is the scale.  Choose the correct scale of your layout by
selecting it from the Preferences Warrants panel. The warrants panel at <i>Edit->Preferences->Warrants<i> is where 
this and other warrant parameters can be edited.
<p>
<h3>Set the Algorithm Parameters</h3>
At the bottom of the NXWarrant window are the following items.
<ul>
	<li><b>Max number of blocks in route</b> Maximum number of blocks the route algorithm should go 
		before stopping.</li>
	<li><b>Max Throttle Setting</b> - Throttle setting for the top speed the warrant will reach.</li>
	<li><b>Ramp Step Interval Time</b> - Throttle setting for the first speed step when starting.
		(Default from Preferences Warrant panel, but can be modified for this NXWarrant only.)
	<li><b>Ramp Step Throttle Increment</b> - Throttle setting for the first speed step when starting
		and each speed step until the Max Throttle Setting is reached.
		(Default from Preferences Warrant panel, but can be modified for this NXWarrant only.)</li>
	</ul><ul>
		The above labels for the throttle settings depend upon the Speed Name interpretation at 
		<i>Edit->Preferences->Warrants<i> and could be, for example, <b>Max Scale speed Mph</b> and 
		<b>Ramp Speed Increment Mph</b>.
	</ul><ul> 
	<li><b>Train Name</b> - Indicator Track icons set to display train names will show this name when the train
		occupies the OBlock the icon represents.  If left blank, the locomotive address is displayed.
	<li><b>Engine Roster</b> - Pick a train from the Roster from this drop down combo box.  The locomotive 
		address and train id will be displayed.
	<li><b>Address</b> - The decoder address of the locomotive of the train.  This is a required field.</li>
	</ul><ul>
		Note, when editing a Indicator Track Icon (<i>Edit Indicator Track</i> popup.)there is a 
		<b>Display Train Name when occupied</b> check box in the edit dialog.
	</ul><ul>
	<li>Radio buttons <b>Forward</b> and <b>Reverse</b> Set the direction of the locomotive.
	</ul><ul>  
		<i><b>It is important to set this correctly.</i></b></li>
	</ul><ul>	 
	<li>Checkbox <b>EStop at Destination Block</b> Emergency stop the train upon entering the last block. 
		<i>Rarely Needed.</i></li>
	<li>Checkbox <b>Halt Start at Origin Block</b> Allocate and set the warrant, but don't start the train 
		until the user issues a <b>Resume</b> command to the warrant from the Warrant List Table or via a 
		Logix Warrant Control action.</li>
	<li>Checkbox <b>Compute Throttle Factor</b> Calculate a Speed Profile throttle factor during this
		NXWarrant run.</li>
	</ul><ul>
		A Via Location must be specified before running the warrant.   See the section below for details. 
	</ul><ul>
	<li>Buttons <b>Run NX Warrant</b> and <b>Cancel</b> 		
	<li>Radio buttons <b>Run Auto</b> for an automated warrant. and <b>Run Manual</b> to dispatch a 
		route for a manual operator</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Running the Warrant</h3>
Pressing the 
<b>Run NX Warrant</b> button computes the route and runs the addressed train at the specified 
speeds and direction. If more
than one route meets the criterion, you are presented with a list to review and select the 
route you want.  The Via and Avoid location fields may be used to restrict the list.
</p><p>
<h3>Calculate a Speed Profile Throttle Factor</h3>
When the <b>Compute Throttle Factor</b> checkbox is selected
running the warrant will compute  Speed Profile throttle factor.  The "Via" block 
is used as a speed trap to determine the track speed and compare it to the throttle setting. When the
Via block is crossed the warrant will report the speed and Throttle Factor.
The Factor can then be saved into the Speed Profile to be used in any warrant where this engine address is used.
<p>
Choose a Via block of accurate length, reasonably long, where the train can fully reach the maximum speed set
and exit the block before ramping down.  Generally the factors calculated for the mid and high ranges of speed
are relatively constant.  Typically, the factors diverge at slow speeds.  For a given throttle setting, Speed Profile
factors can vary due to temperature changes, consist load and other conditions.  Getting reproducible factors 
from day to day within 10 to 15 percent is satisfactory.
<p>
<h3>Saving NXWarrants to make them Permanently Saved</h3>
If you press the <b>Edit</b> button on the Warrant List Table of the NXwarrant while it is still executing, the
Create/Edit Warrant Window for the NXWarrant will open.  Use the <b>Copy</b> button to make a permanent warrant that
can be edited later.
<p>
<h3>Some Tips for Smooth Start Up and Slow Down</h3>
It is good practice to have a length specified for each block.  A rough estimate is better than letting it be 0.
If the second block has length 0 any remaining speed steps not done in the starting block will be put in that block.  
Lengths can be set for individual paths within a block in the CircuitBuilder should that be desirable.
<p>
If the next to last block has length 0 you should input 
its length, so the algorithm can start the ramp down in the previous block (block before the next-to-last).  Although a 
zero length last block will set speed to 0 immediately, momentum could cause the train to overrun if the next-to-last 
block hasn't completed the ramp down.  Or in this case, use the E-stop option, but that could be rather abrupt.
<p>
For a series of short blocks with length specified the ramp up and ramp down is distributed over the blocks as needed.   
Also, for short routes, the algorithm calculates only enough ramp up so the ramp down can finish without overrunning 
the last block. 
<p>
The script's
block synchronization will adjust the the elapsed times.  <b>Note!</b> if the route includes a <i>Dark</i> block, i.e.
no occupancy detection, it is very important it's block length is known since in this case, synchronization cannot
be done.
<p>
For locos with no momentum,  
short times make smoother ramps.  For locos with lots of momentum, longer periods should be used. 
The defaults are set for a modest amount of momentum, i.e. perhaps less than prototype but visually OK.  Observe how 
the train behaves and adjust accordingly.
