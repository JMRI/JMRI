      <h1>Train Trackers</h1>
     	A <b>Tracker</b> is a means to to see the movement of trains on your layout panel. 
    	A Tracker has a marker identifying a train 
    	moving on your panel layout diagram following wherever an operator
    	drives his train on your layout.  The position of each tracked train and the time is spends 
    	occupying a block is displayed in a window. A status log
    	is kept of the progress of the trackers.

      <h2>What's Needed to Have a Tracker</h2>
      	Trackers function on the same foundation as Warrants. That is, track occupation
      	detection is by <b>OBlocks</b> and the directions trains move by
      	<b>Portals</b> and <b>Paths</b>. For detailed information about what 
      	these objects are and how to make
      	them see <a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a>
      	or <a href="../OBlockTable.shtml">Occupancy Block Tables</a>. 
      	<p>
      	Next, your panel
      	layout diagram must done with Indicator Track icons. These icons display the status
      	of the block they represent with colors and can show names.  If your diagram has already 
      	been created using regular track icons, they can easily be converted to Indicator
      	Track icons with <b><a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a></b>. 
      	The <a href="../display/ItemPalette.shtml">Item Palette</a> has more information
      	about Indicator Track icons.
      	</p><p>
      	All the track of your layout should be represented
      	with OBlocks, even the sections with no sensors. Although Tracker cannot detect
      	when such a "dark block" is entered, it is smart enough to know when a train has
      	passed through one. So it is beneficial to configure them when there is a path
      	through them connecting one occupancy block with another. 
      	</p><p>
      	The last requirement is each block should have
      	at least one Indicator Track icon configured to display names. The popup
      	window displayed when the <i>Edit Icon</i> menu item is selected
      	has a checkbox labeled "<i>Display Train Name when occupied</i>".
      	(You must edit with 
      	<a href="../display/ControlPanelEditor.shtml">Control Panel Editor</a>
      	to get this window.) 
      	Check this box to show the current location of a tracked train.
      	</p>

      <h2>How to Make a Tracker</h2>
      	The <b>Warrants</b> menu has a <i>Train Trackers</i> item that opens the 
      	<b>Tracker Table</b> window. The table has a <b>New Tracker</b> button that
      	displays a Create Tracker dialog. Enter the name of the train and the block 
      	that it occupies to make a tracker for the train. The name will appear on
      	the track icon selected for display in every block the train occupies. As 
      	train moves track icons change colors and show the name of the tracker

		<h3>An Easier Way to Make a Tracker</h3>
      	A much easier way to make a Tracker is simply to drag and drop a <b>Marker</b>
      	icon onto the block the train occupies. This opens the <b>Tracker Table</b> window
      	automatically and creates a Tracker with the text and color of the marker.
      	When a tracker is made this way, the marker will return to its docking position.
      	A marker's docking position can be set from it's popup menu. Markers have
      	a popup menu to configure them when not in an editing mode, but setting the
      	docking position must be done in an editing mode.

       <h2>The Tracker Table</h2>
      	 The Tracker Table window consists of a list of the active trackers with their current
      	 status. Each line shows the block the train is currently occupying the longest and
      	 the elapsed time it has been there.
      	 A <b>Stop</b> button on each row will terminate the tracker.
		<p>
		 Below the list
      	 is the <b>Last Event</b> status window. The events shown are: when a trains enters
      	 a block, leaves a block and any error or warning message.  When leaving a block
      	 the elapsed time the
      	 block was occupied is recorded. A mouse click on the window drops
      	 down a record of the last 20 events.
		</p><p>
		 Below the status window are two buttons;
      	 the <b>New tracker</b> button which was mentioned above, and the 
      	 <b>Refresh Tracker Info</b> button. The button updates the elapsed time each tracker
      	 has spent in its current block.
      	 </p>
      	 <h3>The Tracking Options Menu</h3>
      	 The <b>Tracking Options</b> menu has three items:
      	 <ul>
      	 	<li><b>Multiple Trackers Ranking</b> applies only when several trackers are running.
      	 		It is an advanced feature discussed below.</li>
      	 	<li><b>OBlock Pick List</b> opens a OBlock table window. The items can be dragged to
      	 		the New Tracker dialog.</li>
      	 	<li><b>Open Session Log</b> opens a dialog to create a session log.  All Tracker events
      	 		and Warrant events are logged to this file. The default directory of this file
      	 		is the <i>File Location</i> directory you specified in Preferences.</li>
      	</ul>

       <h2>When Multiple Trackers Are Active</h2>
      	A tracker posts an identifying label on all the blocks that
      	its train currently occupies.
      	Any block adjacent to the head or tail of its train becoming occupied
      	is assumed to be the move of the train.  However, when two or
      	more trackers have adjacent blocks in common and a common block becomes
      	occupied, which tracker has actually made the move is indeterminate. 
      	When this happens a dialog is displayed for the 
      	panel user to determine which tracked train occupies contested the block.

		<h3>Filtering Multiple Trackers</h3>      	
      	When multiple trackers "compete" for occupation of a block there is no way to
      	guarantee the selection of the train actually entering the block.  However,
      	the Tracker Table can make an educated guess. The <b>Multiple Trackers Ranking</b>
      	menu item <i>Only Show Most Likely Trackers</i> activates this feature. Note that
      	unlike warrants which always set turnouts to be paths in a block, manual operators
      	can throw switches that don't configure a path. This "Most Likely" option is
      	based on the following logic:
      	<p>
      	A tracker that has both a path set to exit its current block and a path set to enter
      	the newly occupied block is chosen over a tracker having only one path exiting 
      	or entering the block. The latter such tracker has precedence over a tracker with
      	neither an exit nor an entrance path set.
      	</p><p>
      	This could be useful in situations where the panel operator does not have full
      	view of the layout. Should ties occur in the ranking, the dialog to pick the
      	tracker is displayed.
      	</p>
