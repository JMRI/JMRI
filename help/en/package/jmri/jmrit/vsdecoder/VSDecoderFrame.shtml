      <h1>JMRI Virtual Sound Decoder Decoder Window</h1>
      This is the quick reference page for the Decoder window
      (old GUI) in the JMRI Virtual Sound Decoder tool.<br>
      <br>
      What is this thing? The Virtual Sound Decoder ("VSDecoder"
      for short) sits on your computer, listening to its assigned
      decoder address. When you do things to the throttle (change
      speed or press the function button), it makes sounds, just
      like a physical sound decoder in your locomotive would -
      except the sound comes from your computer.<br>
      Virtual Sound Decoder is completely independent of the
      hardware layout, and can be used in stand-alone mode. You
      don't even have to have a locomotive in the Roster to use
      it.<br>
      You <i>do</i> need to have a working sound system and
      speakers on your computer, of course!<br>
      You must also have the OpenAL or JavaSound audio system
      installed on your computer. See the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/Audio.shtml">JMRI
      Audio Help Pages</a> for details.<br>
      <br>See the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/Main_VSD.shtml">
      DecoderPro Manual Pages</a> for more details on Virtual
      Sound Decoder.<br>

      <h2>VSDecoder Window Elements</h2>
      <hr>

      <h3>Config Tab</h3>The Config pane lets you choose which
      sound profile to use (steam vs. Diesel, EMD vs. GE, Leslie
      vs. Nathan, etc.), and assign a decoder address to listen to.

      <h4>Roster Select and Save</h4>You can select an existing
      Roster Entry, if you have any. Press the "Save" button to
      store the currently loaded VSD File and Profile to the
      selected Roster Entry. The next time you select that Roster
      Entry, it will auto-load the stored VSD File and Profile.<br>
      You don't have to use the Roster at all if you don't want
      to.<br>
      NOTE: See the note below about saving the Roster Entry
      information. There is a bug that I'm working on.

      <h4>Profile Selection</h4>To select a profile, you must first
      load a "VSD File". An example VSD file is included with the
      package, 
      more examples are available for download
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/vsdecoder">on the web</a>,
      and you can make (and share!) your own. Choose
      "File-&gt;Loadd VSD File" and load a VSD file. You can't do
      anything else (except pick a roster entry) until a VSD file
      is loaded.<br>
      Now you can choose one of the listed Profiles from the
      Profile drop-down. Note that you can't do anything else until
      you've selected a Profile.

      <h4>Address Assignment and the Roster</h4>Once you've loaded
      a VSD file and set a Profile, you can either enter a decoder
      Address directly - and press "Set" - or you can choose a
      locomotive from your roster. The VSD will then respond to
      throttle inputs. It will listen to <i>any</i> throttle that
      sends status information to JMRI. This includes JMRI software
      throttles, "smart phone" throttles like WiThrottle and
      EngineDriver, and most (but not all) hardware throttles.<br>
      <hr>
      <br>

      <h3>Options Tab</h3>In the future, the Options pane will
      provide various option settings. For now, it is
      non-functional. The gadgets on this pane are just for show.

      <h3>Sounds Tab</h3>The Sounds tab provides a set of
      customized buttons for triggering sounds without having to
      use a Throttle. This allows the VSDecoder to be used in a
      sort of "stand-alone" mode. The exact buttons shown will
      depend on which VSD file you have loaded.<br>
      <i>Note: In the "example.vsd" file, the "Coupler" and "Air
      Brake" buttons are non-functional, there just for
      show.</i><br>

      <h4>Special note about Engine sounds</h4>The actual engine
      sound generation is still very "rough". Expect rather "jerky"
      transitions between speed steps, and some other odd effects.
      Be patient. This is still "Alpha" code!<br>
      By default, the Engine sounds will not respond to throttle
      inputs until you have pressed the "Engine Start" button on
      the Sounds tab. This is to preserve a semblance of realism in
      that you must start the engine before it will run. This
      feature is completely independent of the actual locomotive
      operation. If you would prefer to have your engine sounds
      start immediately when you advance the throttle, without
      first pressing "Engine Start", there is a setting in the
      VSDecoder Preferences to change this. (This feature is
      currently broken for Steam sounds...)<br>
      Also note that the slider above the "Engine Start" button is
      only an indicator of which notch the engine is in. Moving the
      slider has no effect.<br>

      <h2>Menu Items</h2>
      <hr>

      <h3>File Menu</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>Load VSDecoder File</dt>

        <dd>Pops up a file chooser to load a VSD File. Most
        VSDecoder functions will not work until you have loaded a
        VSD File.</dd>

        <dt>VSDecoder Preferences</dt>

        <dd>Launches the VSDecoder Preferences pane.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Window and Help Menus</h3>These are the standard JMRI
      Window and Help menus.<br>
      <hr>

      <h2>VSDecoder Preferences</h2>
      <hr>
      The VSDecoder Preferences pane allows you to customize how
      the Virtual Sound Decoder works.

      <dl>
        <dt>Auto Start Engine</dt>

        <dd>If this box is checked, the engine sounds will respond
        to throttle inputs immediately, without having to first
        press the "Engine Start" button.</dd>

        <dt>Auto Load VSD File</dt>

        <dd>If this box is checked, the VSD File specified in the
        Default Path/Name fields will be automatically loaded on
        decoder start-up.</dd>

        <dt>Default VSD File PathThis path is both the default path
        for the "Load VSD File" chooser box and the expected path
        for the Default VSD File if the "Auto Load VSD File"
        checkbox is selected.</dt>

        <dt>Default VSD File Name</dt>

        <dd>This VSD file, assumed to be in the "Default VSD File
        Path", will be auto-loaded on decoder start-up, if the
        "Auto Load VSD File" checkbox is checked.</dd>
      </dl><br>
      <hr>

      <h2>Roster Interaction</h2>
      <hr>
      Virtual Sound Decoder connections to the Roster are still a
      bit "under construction". You can do the following:

      <ul>
        <li>Set the VSDecoder address from a Roster entry</li>

        <li>Store a preferred VSDecoder File and Profile Name to a
        Roster entry</li>

        <li>Auto-set the VSDecoder Profile and address from a
        Roster entry</li>
      </ul>To store the current VSDecoder profile setting to a
      Roster Entry, select the Roster Entry and click the "Save"
      button. See the bug note below, though! A few notes on
      limitations (bugs, mostly):

      <ul>
        <li>If you choose a Roster Entry before loading the VSD
        file, it will not set the address.</li>

        <li>If you store VSDecoder info to a Roster Entry, it will
        not be saved to disk unless you go to "Roster-&gt;Edit
        Entry...", select your roster entry, open the programmer
        for it, and click "Save to Roster".</li>

        <li>All of the sounds are still "rough". Expect odd
        transitions between speed settings, strange effects when
        you press buttons rapidly (and sometimes not), and so
        on.</li>

        <li>Many other things are buggy or broken. Please log a bug
        report if something appears truly broken.</li>
      </ul>
