      <h1>JMRI Virtual Sound Decoder</h1>

      <p>This is the quick reference page for the JMRI Virtual Sound Decoder Manage VSD Locations
      tool.</p>

      <p>The Manage VSD Locations window provides a consolidated location to manage and set the
      apparent physical location of sounds for trains using Virtual Sound Decoder.</p>

      <p>Locations can be assigned to Reporters, Blocks, Operations Locations and to the Listener
      (there is only one Listener).</p>

      <p>You can set X / Y / Z coordinates for each location.<br>
      Reporters, Blocks and Operations Locations can be marked as "Tunnel". This will change the
      sound when a locomotive is within such a location.</p>

      <h2>Tabs</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Reporters Tab: Set locations for JMRI Reporters</li>

        <li>Blocks Tab: Set locations for JMRI Blocks</li>

        <li>Operations Locations Tab: Set locations for JMRI Operations Locations</li>

        <li>Listeners Tab: Set location and orientation of the Listener</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Listeners attributes are saved to VSDecoder Preferences (VSDecoderPreferences.xml).<br>
        Operations locations are saved to the folder operations in your current JMRI Profile
        (OperationsLocationRoster.xml).<br>
        Both are loaded automatically at VSD start respectively JMRI start.</li>

        <li>Reporters and Blocks are not saved to a file.<br>
          If you want to store Reporters or Blocks to a file, go to <strong>Tools &rArr; Tables
          &rArr; table &rArr; File &rArr; Store...</strong><br>
          In case you have an open Panel with a reference to a location, store that Panel.<br>
          Reporters or Blocks must be loaded manually or via JMRI Preferences Startup Action (Open
          File).<br>
          See <a href="../../../../../html/apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">Loading and Storing Your
          Work</a> for details on loading and storing.
        </li>

        <li>If you add new Reporters, Blocks or Locations you must close and re-open the Manage VSD
        Locations window to have them appear.</li>

        <li>"Use Location" marks locations which should be saved. It is a temporary filter and is
        not saved.</li>

        <li>The Reporters and Blocks tables have an additional column "User Name". If a "User Name"
        doesn't exist, the "System Name" is displayed.</li>

        <li>The Listeners attribute "Listener Mode" is not supported and will be removed at a later
        time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>See the <a href="../../../../../html/tools/vsd/index.shtml">
      documentation pages</a> for more details on Virtual Sound Decoder.</p>
