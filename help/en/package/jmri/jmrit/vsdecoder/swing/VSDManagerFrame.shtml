<h1>JMRI Virtual Sound Decoder</h1>


This is the quick reference page for the JMRI Virtual Sound Decoder tool.<br>

<br>
  What is this thing?  The Virtual Sound Secoder ("VSDecoder" for short)
  sits on your
  computer, listening to its assigned decoder address.  When you do
  things to the throttle (change speed or press the function button),
  it makes sounds, just like a physical sound decoder in your
  locomotive would - except the sound comes from your computer.
  <br>
  Virtual Sound Decoder is completely independent of the hardware
  layout, and can be used in stand-alone mode.  You don't even have to
  have a locomotive in the Roster to use it.
  <br>
  You <i>do</i> need to have a working sound system and speakers on
  your computer, of course!
  <br>
  You must also have the OpenAL or JavaSound audio system installed on
  your computer.  See <a
  href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/tools/Audio.shtml">the
  JMRI Audio Help Pages</a> for details.
  <br>
  <hr>
  <h2>VSDecoder Manager Window</h2>
  <p>The VSDecoder Manager Window contains a control panel for each
  Virtual Sound Decoder ("VSDecoder") that is running.</p>
  <p> When first launched the window is empty, except for a volume
  slider, mute button, and "Add Decoder" button.  To create a
  VSDecoder, click "Add Decoder".  This will open the VSDecoder Config
  Dialog.</p>
  <p>The Volume slider and Mute button are "master" controls that
  control the sound output of all running VSDecoders.</p>

  <h3>VSDecoder Config Dialog</h3>
    The Config Dialog lets you choose which sound profile to use (steam
  vs. Diesel, EMD vs. GE, Leslie vs. Nathan, etc.), and assign a
  decoder address to listen to.
  <h4>Roster Select and Save</h4>
  You can select an existing Roster Entry, if you have any.  Press the 
  "Save" button to store the currently loaded VSD File and Profile to the
  selected Roster Entry.  The next time you select that Roster Entry,
  it will auto-load the stored VSD File and Profile.
  <br>
  You don't have to use the Roster at all if you don't want to.
  <br>
  <h4>Profile Selection</h4>
  To select a profile, you must first load a "VSD File".  An example
  VSD file is included with the package, and you can make (and share!)
  your own.  Click the "Load VSD File" button or choose "File->Load
    VSD File" from the menu bar to load a VSD file.  You
  can't do anything else (except pick a roster entry) until a VSD file is loaded.
  <br>
  Now you can choose one of the listed Profiles from the Profile
  drop-down.  Note that you can't do anything else (except pick a roster entry) until you've
  selected a Profile.
  <h4>Address Assignment and the Roster</h4>
  Once you've loaded a VSD file and set a Profile, you can either
  enter a decoder Address directly - and click "Set" - or you can
  choose a locomotive from your roster.  The VSD will then respond to
  throttle inputs.  It will listen to <i>any</i> throttle that sends
  status information to JMRI.  This includes JMRI software throttles,
  "smart phone" throttles like WiThrottle and EngineDriver, and most
  (but not all) hardware throttles.
  <br>
Once you have configured your decoder, click "OK" to start it.
<h4>Decoder Control Pane</h4>
<p>When you Add a VSDecoder, you will see a pane full of controls for
    that decoder. Left to right you see the locomotive address, a set
    of buttons for directly playing engine and auxiliary sounds, and a
    set of buttons for controlling the decoder directly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Config : Launch the Config Dialog for this VSDecoder</li>
  <li>Options : Launch the Options Dialog for this VSDecoder</li>
  <li>Delete : Delete this VSDecoder</li>
</ul>

<p>The exact selection of sound control buttons will very depending on
the Sound Profile you have loaded.</p>
<p>Note: Some of the buttons may be non-functional, for
display/demonstration purposes only</p>
<h5> Diesel Engine Control</h5>
The Diesel Engine Control comes with two features.
<ul>
  <li>Notch Indicator:  This "Spinner" shows the current "notch" the
  engine is running at.  This is an indicator, not a control. </li>
  <li>Engine Start Button:  Press this button to start the engine
  sound.  Press it again to shut down the engine sound.</li>
</ul>
<br>
By default, the Engine sounds will not respond to throttle inputs
  until you have pressed the "Engine Start" button on the Sounds tab.
  This is to preserve a semblance of realism in that you must start
  the engine before it will run.  This feature is completely
  independent of the actual locomotive operation.  If you would prefer
  to have your engine sounds start immediately when you advance the
  throttle, without first pressing "Engine Start", there is a setting
  in the VSDecoder Preferences to change this.  (This feature is
  currently broken for Steam sounds...)
<br>
 

<hr>
<h3>Options Dialog</h3>
<p>In the future, the Options Dialog will provide various option settings.
For now, it is non-functional.  The gadgets on this pane are just
for show.</p>
<h4>Special note about Engine sounds</h4>
The actual engine sound generation is still very "rough".  Expect
  rather "jerky" transitions between speed steps, and some other odd
  effects.  Be patient.  This is still "Alpha" code!

<h2> Menu Items </h2>
<hr>
<h3> File Menu </h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Load VSDecoder File</dt>
  <dd>Pops up a file chooser to load a VSD File.  Most VSDecoder functions
    will not work until you have loaded a VSD File.</dd>
 </dl>
 <h3> Edit Menu </h3>
 <dl>
   <dt>VSDecoder Preferences<dt>
   <dd>Launches the VSDecoder Preferences pane.<dd>
</dl>

<h3> Window and Help Menus </h3>
These are the standard JMRI Window and Help menus.
  <br><hr>
<h2> VSDecoder Preferences</h2>
  <hr>
The VSDecoder Preferences pane allows you to customize how the Virtual
  Sound Decoder works.
  <dl>
    <dt>Auto Start Engine</dt>
    <dd>If this box is checked, the engine sounds will respond to throttle
      inputs immediately, without having to first press the "Engine Start"
      button.</dd>
<dt>Auto Load VSD File</dt>
<dd>If this box is checked, the VSD File specified in the Default
  Path/Name fields will be automatically loaded on decoder start-up.</dd>
  <dt>Default VSD File Path</td
  <dd>This path is both the default path for the "Load VSD File" chooser box
    and the expected path for the Default VSD File if the "Auto Load VSD
    File" checkbox is selected.</dd>
<dt>Default VSD File Name</dt>
<dd>This VSD file, assumed to be in the "Default VSD File Path", will be
  auto-loaded on decoder start-up, if the "Auto Load VSD File"
  checkbox is checked.</dd>
</dl>
<br><hr>
<h2> Roster Interaction </h2>
<hr>
Virtual Sound Decoder connections to the Roster are still a bit "under
construction".
You can do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Set the VSDecoder address from a Roster entry</li>
  <li>Store a preferred VSDecoder File and Profile Name to a Roster
  entry</li>
  <li>Auto-set the VSDecoder Profile and address from a Roster
  entry</li>
</ul>

To store the current VSDecoder profile setting to a Roster Entry,
select the Roster Entry and click the "Save" button.

<h2> Bugs and other notes </h2>
A few notes on limitations (bugs, mostly):
<ul>
 <li>All of the sounds are still "rough".  Expect odd transitions
  between speed settings, strange effects when you press buttons
  rapidly (and sometimes not), and so on.
  <li>Not all of the sound buttons are functional.
  <li>Many other things are buggy or broken.  Please log a bug report
  if something appears truly broken.
</ul>
