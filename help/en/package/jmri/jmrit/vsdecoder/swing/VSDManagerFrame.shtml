      <h1>JMRI Virtual Sound Decoder Manager Window</h1>
      This is the quick reference page for the Manager window
      in the JMRI Virtual Sound Decoder tool.<br>
      <br>
      What is this thing? The Virtual Sound Secoder ("VSDecoder"
      for short) sits on your computer, listening to its assigned
      decoder address. When you do things to the throttle (change
      speed or press the function button), it makes sounds, just
      like a physical sound decoder in your locomotive would -
      except the sound comes from your computer.<br>
      Virtual Sound Decoder is completely independent of the
      hardware layout, and can be used in stand-alone mode. You
      don't even have to have a locomotive in the Roster to use
      it.<br>
      You <i>do</i> need to have a working sound system and
      speakers on your computer, of course!<br>
      You must also have the OpenAL or JavaSound audio system
      installed on your computer. See the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/Audio.shtml">JMRI
      Audio Help Pages</a> for details.<br>
      <br>See the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/Main_VSD.shtml">
      DecoderPro Manual Pages</a> for more details on Virtual
      Sound Decoder.<br>

      <h2>Virtual Sound Decoder Manager Window</h2>

      <p>The VSDecoder Manager Window contains a control panel for
      each Virtual Sound Decoder ("VSDecoder") that is running.</p>

      <p>When first launched the window is empty, except for a
      volume slider, "Mute" button, and "Add Decoder" button. To
      create a VSDecoder, click "Add Decoder". This will open the
      Configure New VSDecoder Window.</p>

      <p>The Volume slider and Mute button are "master" controls
      that control the sound output of all running VSDecoders.</p>

      <h3>Configure New VSDecoder Window</h3>A config dialog lets you
      choose which sound profile to use (Steam vs. Diesel, EMD vs.
      GE, Leslie vs. Nathan, etc.), and assign a decoder address to
      listen to.

      <h4>Roster Select and Save</h4>
      You can select an existing 
      Roster Entry, if you have any. Press the "Save" button to
      store the currently loaded VSD File and Profile to the
      selected Roster Entry. The next time you select that Roster
      Entry, it will auto-load the stored VSD File and Profile.<br>
      You don't have to use the Roster at all if you don't want
      to.<br>

      <h4>Profile Selection</h4>
      To select a profile, you must first
      load a "VSD File". An example VSD file is included with the
      package, more examples are available for download
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/vsdecoder">on the web</a>
      and you can make (and share!) your own.<br>
	  Click the
      "Load VSD File" button or choose "File-&gt;Load VSD File"
      from the menu bar to load a VSD file. You can't do anything
      else (except pick a roster entry) until a VSD file is
      loaded.<br>
      Now you can choose one of the listed Profiles from the
      Profile drop-down. Note that you can't do anything else
      (except pick a roster entry) until you've selected a Profile.

      <h4>Address Assignment and the Roster</h4>
      Once you've loaded
      a VSD file and set a Profile, you can either enter a decoder
      Address directly - and click "Set" - or you can choose a
      locomotive from your roster. The VSDecoder will then respond
      to throttle inputs. It will listen to <i>any</i> throttle
      that sends status information to JMRI. This includes JMRI
      software throttles, "smart phone" throttles like WiThrottle
      and EngineDriver, and most (but not all) hardware throttles.
      <br>
      Once you have configured your decoder, click "OK" to start
      it.

      <h3>Decoder Control Pane</h3>
      When you Add a VSDecoder, you will see a pane full of
      controls for that decoder. Left to right you see the
      locomotive address, the profile name, a set of buttons for
      directly playing engine and auxiliary sounds, and a set of
      buttons for controlling the decoder directly.

      <ul>
        <li>Options: Launch the Options Dialog for this
        VSDecoder</li>

        <li>Delete: Delete this VSDecoder</li>
      </ul>

      The exact selection of sound control buttons will very
      depending on the Sound Profile you have loaded.<br>
      <br>
      Note: Some of the buttons may be non-functional, for
      display/demonstration purposes only.<br>

      <h4>Engine Control</h4>The Engine Control comes
      with two features.

      <ul>
        <li>Notch Indicator: This "Spinner" shows the current
        "notch" the engine is running at. This is an indicator, not
        a control.</li>

        <li>Engine Start Button: Press this button to start the
        engine sound. Press it again to shut down the engine
        sound.</li>
      </ul><br>
      By default, the Engine sounds will not respond to throttle
      inputs until you have pressed the "Engine Start" button on
      the Sounds tab. This is to preserve a semblance of realism in
      that you must start the engine before it will run. This
      feature is completely independent of the actual locomotive
      operation. If you would prefer to have your engine sounds
      start immediately when you advance the throttle, without
      first pressing "Engine Start", there is a setting in the
      VSDecoder Preferences to change this. (This feature is
      currently not active ...)<br>
      <hr>

      <h3>Options Dialog</h3>
      The Options Dialog provides a train selection for each
      VSDecoder. When you MOVE the train in Operations, the sound
      will move to the next location on the Route.

      <h2>Menu Items</h2>
      <hr>

      <h3>File Menu</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>Load VSDecoder File</dt>

        <dd>Pops up a file chooser to load a VSD File. Most
        VSDecoder functions will not work until you have loaded a
        VSD File.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Edit Menu</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>VSDecoder Preferences</dt>

        <dd>Launches the VSDecoder Preferences pane.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Window and Help Menus</h3>These are the standard JMRI
      Window and Help menus.<br>
      <br>
      <hr>

      <h2>VSDecoder Preferences</h2>
      <hr>
      The VSDecoder Preferences pane allows you to customize how
      the Virtual Sound Decoder works.

      <dl>
        <dt>Auto Start Engine</dt>

        <dd>If this box is checked, the engine sounds will respond
        to throttle inputs immediately, without having to first
        press the "Engine Start" button.</dd>

        <dt>Auto Load VSD File</dt>

        <dd>If this box is checked, the VSD File specified in the
        Default Path/Name fields will be automatically loaded on
        decoder start-up.</dd>

        <dt>Default VSD File Path</dt>
		
		<dd>This path is both the default path
        for the "Load VSD File" chooser box and the expected path
        for the Default VSD File if the "Auto Load VSD File"
        checkbox is selected.</dd>

        <dt>Default VSD File Name</dt>

        <dd>This VSD file, assumed to be in the "Default VSD File
        Path", will be auto-loaded on decoder start-up, if the
        "Auto Load VSD File" checkbox is checked.</dd>
      </dl>
      <hr>

      <h2>Roster Interaction</h2>
      <hr>
      Virtual Sound Decoder connections to the Roster are still a
      bit "under construction". You can do the following:

      <ul>
        <li>Set the VSDecoder address from a Roster entry</li>

        <li>Store a preferred VSDecoder File and Profile Name to a
        Roster entry</li>

        <li>Auto-set the VSDecoder Profile and address from a
        Roster entry</li>
      </ul>To store the current VSDecoder profile setting to a
      Roster Entry, select the Roster Entry and click the "Save"
      button.<br>

      <hr>
      <h2>Bugs and other notes</h2>A few notes on limitations
      (bugs, mostly):

      <ul>
        <li>All of the sounds are still "rough". Expect odd
        transitions between speed settings, strange effects when
        you press buttons rapidly (and sometimes not), and so
        on.</li>

        <li>Not all of the sound buttons are functional.</li>

        <li>Many other things are buggy or broken. Please log a bug
        report if something appears truly broken.</li>
      </ul>
