      <h1>JMRI: WiThrottle Protocol</h1>

      <p>This page describes the protocol provided by the <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/package-summary.html">
      jmri.jmrit.withrottle</a> package for controlling trains,
      turnouts, and more through JMRI via a TCP/IP socket.</p>

      <p>JMRI uses a fairly simple text-based client-server
      protocol over TCP/IP sockets. Throttles (or other
      applications) can locate JMRI by sending a multi-cast DNS
      request, using ZeroConf/Bonjour, for the address
      "_withrottle._tcp.local". JMRI won't always reply (it depends
      on your operating system, firewall settings, and network
      environment), so your application should also allow entering
      an IP address and port.</p>

      <p>When you first open the connection, JMRI responds with a
      number of lines of text that provide information about the
      JMRI instance to which you've connected. Your application
      then sends commands to JMRI. Each of these commands is plain
      text, with a system-specific newline character at the end (typically 0A hex). Similarly,
      lines sent back from JMRI are terminated by a system-specific newline.
      A newline can be a linefeed (0A hex), carriage return (0D hex),
      or a carriage return followed by a newline. (0D 0A hex)
      Clients and servers should accept any newline sequence as a command termination.</p>

      <p>You can see these messages by enabling DEBUG
      for the JMRI package jmri.jmrit.withrottle.
      Add the line "<b>log4j.category.jmri.jmrit.withrottle=DEBUG</b>"
      to your default.lcf file and restart JMRI. All messages (both directions)
      will be added to your JMRI System Console and the session.log file.
      </p>

      <h2>String Parsing</h2>

      <p>JMRI commands and results are very often arrays of values,
      and sometimes arrays of arrays. The array elements are
      separated by three-character delimiters. For example, the
      following roster entry contains two engines, and each engine
      has three values:</p>
      <pre class="code">
RL2<span class="delimiter1">]\[</span>RGS 41<span class=
"delimiter2">}|{</span>41<span class=
"delimiter2">}|{</span>L<span class=
"delimiter1">]\[</span>Test Loco<span class=
"delimiter2">}|{</span>1234<span class="delimiter2">}|{</span>L
</pre>

      <p>Here the delimiters are color-coded to make it easier to
      see the two different delimiters. The <code class=
      "delimiter1"><b>]\[</b></code> delimiter is used to divide
      the different roster entries (there are two), while the
      <code class="delimiter2">}|{</code> delimiter is used to
      divide the parts of each roster entry. The details are
      described in sections below for each command and
      response.</p>

      <h2>Initial Connection</h2>

      <p>When you first open a socket to JMRI, you may get a
      response that will look something like the following:</p>
      <pre class="code">
VN2.0
RL1]\[SP 2101}|{2102}|{L
PPA2
PTT]\[Turnouts}|{Turnout]\[Closed}|{2]\[Thrown}|{4
PRT]\[Routes}|{Route]\[Active}|{2]\[Inactive}|{4
RCC0
PW12080
*10
</pre>

      <p class="note">Some implementations will not send these initial
      lines until a command has been sent by the client.  The Digitrax LnWI
      will send <code>VN2.0</code> in response to an <code>N</code>
      command, while a more complete block is sent in response to
      the <code>H</code> command.</p>

      <p>Each line contains information for part of JMRI, as
      described below, so your application can show things like
      engines, turnouts, etc.</p>

      <h3>WiThrottle Protocol Version</h3>

      <p>The first string, <code>VN2.0</code>, provides the version
      number of the WiThrottle protocol. In this case the version
      number is 2.0.</p>

      <h3>Roster List</h3>

      <p>The roster string always begins with <code>RL</code>
      (Roster List) followed by the number of entries in the
      roster. Here are three different examples of roster strings
      that might be returned by JMRI:</p>
      <pre class="code">
RL0
RL2]\[RGS 41}|{41}|{L]\[Test Loco}|{1234}|{L
RL3]\[D&amp;RGW 341}|{3}|{S]\[RGS 41}|{41}|{L]\[Test Loco}|{1234}|{L
</pre>

      <p>with zero, two, and three roster entries, respectively.
      Each roster entry contains three pieces of information,
      always in the same order:</p>

      <table class="data">
        <tr>
          <th>Segment</th>

          <th>Example</th>

          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Name</td>

          <td>RGS 41</td>

          <td>The name to show in your application</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Address</td>

          <td>41</td>

          <td>The DCC address of the locomotive</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Length</td>

          <td>L</td>

          <td>S or L to indicate if this is a Short or Long DCC
          address</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Track Power</h3>

      <p>Returns information about the curent state of track power.
      This can be one of the following:</p>

      <table class="data">
        <tr>
          <td>PPA0</td>

          <td>Off</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>PPA1</td>

          <td>On</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>PPA2</td>

          <td>Unknown</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Turnout List</h3>

      <p>JMRI returns either zero, one, or two strings for this
      section. The first string provides the labels for the
      different turnout states. For example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
PTT]\[Turnouts}|{Turnout]\[Closed}|{2]\[Thrown}|{4
</pre>

      <p>This string contains an array with two elements, which
      provide the labels to use for each turnout state (except for
      Unknown):</p>

      <table class="data">
        <tr>
          <th>Segment</th>

          <th>Example</th>

          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Caption</td>

          <td>Closed</td>

          <td>The string to show for the state of turnout</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Value</td>

          <td>2</td>

          <td>The corresponding value for the turnout state</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="note">There is also a third value, Unknown,
      represented with the value 1, that is not explicitly given a
      caption in the reply.</p>

      <p>The second string appears when you have turnouts defined
      in JMRI, and contains an array of turnouts, and will look
      something like this:</p>
      <pre class="code">
PTL]\[LT12}|{Rico Station N}|{1]\[LT324}|{Rico Station S}|{2
</pre>

      <p>Each turnout contains the following segments:</p>

      <table class="data">
        <tr>
          <th>Segment</th>

          <th>Example</th>

          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>System Name</td>

          <td>LT12</td>

          <td>The internal name used for this turnout</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>User Name</td>

          <td>Rico Station N</td>

          <td>The name entered into JMRI for this turnout</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>State</td>

          <td>1</td>

          <td>The current state of the turnout (see above)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Route List</h3>

      <p>Like for turnouts, JMRI will reply with zero, one or two
      strings. The first string is likewise a list of labels for
      the route values. Again, Unknown (1) is not explicitly
      listed. For example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
PRT]\[Routes}|{Route]\[Active}|{2]\[Inactive}|{4
</pre>

      <p>The second string contains an array of routes. For
      example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
PRL]\[IR:AUTO:0001}|{Rico Main}|{
</pre>

      <table class="data">
        <tr>
          <th>Segment</th>

          <th>Example</th>

          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>System Name</td>

          <td>IR:AUTO:0001</td>

          <td>The internal name used for this route. The name in
          this example was auto-generated</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>User Name</td>

          <td>Rico Main</td>

          <td>The name entered into JMRI for this turnout</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Consist List</h3>

      <p>The consist list is somewhat similiar in concept to the roster
      list. However, there is a separate line for each consist entry.
      Here is an example of a consist list that contains two entries:</p>

      <pre class="code">
RCC2
RCD}|{74(S)}|{74(S)]\[3374(L)}|{true]\[346(L)}|{true
RCD}|{123(S)}|{123(S)]\[3374(L)}|{true
</pre>

      <p>The first line marks the start of the consist list, with the
      number of entries after the "RCC". Subsequent lines start with
      "RCD}|{" and are followed by information about a single consist
      entry.</p>

      <p>For whatever reason, consist entries don't follow the same
      pattern as roster entries. Here is a summary of the Format
      for each consist entry (with spaces added for readability):</p>

      <pre>
  RCD }|{ consistAddress }|{ consistId
    Array: ]\[  loco DCC Address }|{ locoDirection
</pre>

      <p>Addresses have the format <i>address</i>(S/L). For example,
      3374(L) is a long address and 74(S) is a short addresses.</p>

      <p>In the example above, here is the information about the
      first consist entry:</p>

      <table class="data">
          <tr>
            <th>Data</th>

            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>74(S)</td>

            <td>Consist has short DCC address 74</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
              <td>74(S)</td>

              <td>The ID of the consist</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
              <td>3374(L)}|{true</td>

              <td>Loco with long address 3374 in the forward direction</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
              <td>346(L)}|{true</td>

              <td>Loco with long address 346 in the forward direction</td>
          </tr>
      </table>


      <h3>JMRI Web Port</h3>

      <p>The final string from the initial reply provides the port
      set for the JMRI web server. For example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
PW12080
</pre>

      <p>indicates that the web server port is set to 12080.</p>

      <h2>Property Change Notification</h2>

      <p>There are cases where property changes in JMRI cause a
      message to be sent. These messages are not a response to a
      command, but rather are sent at any time (from the perspective
      of your WiThrottle protocol client). For example, if you have a Throttle
      window open in JMRI and you turn on the light, a property
      change message will be sent with the function information:</p>

      <pre class="code">
MTAL341&lt;;&gt;F10
</pre>

      <p>All property change messages begin with MTA (where 'T' could
      be a different throttle letter) and then the DCC address of the
      locomotive. The part after the &lt;;&gt; separator uses the
      format described below, under the 'F' Function.</p>

      <p>Here is a list of property notifications that can be sent</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Function state changed</li>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>Direction</li>
        <li>Speed step mode</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Commands</h2>

      <p>Once you've established a connection as outlined above,
      you can start sending commands to JMRI. The first letter of
      each command is interpreted by the <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/DeviceServer.java">
      DeviceServer</a> class to determine where to send the rest of
      the command. Here are the letters currently supported:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>'T' sends a throttle command, <i>deprecated, use 'M'</i></li>

        <li>'S' sends a throttle command to a second throttle, <i>deprecated, use 'M'</i></li>

        <li>'M' sends a command to a "multi" throttle</li>

        <li>'D' sends a hex packet to the command station</li>

        <li>'*' sends a heartbeat, or sets heartbeat on or off</li>

        <li>'C' is not used anymore and forwards to the throttle
        controller.</li>

        <li>'N' sets the device name</li>

        <li>'H' sets the device ID.</li>

        <li>'P' sends a panel command</li>

        <li>'R' sends a roster command</li>

        <li>'Q' indicates the device has quit, close its
        window.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>'H' Hardware Information</h3>

      <p>Sets the device ID for the client. This could, for example,
      be the MAC address of the caller, as a string.
      The syntax is <code>HU<i>identifier</i></code>, where <i>identifier</i>
      is different for each connected device.
      This needs to be unique for each device connected to the server, it is
      used to prevent duplicate connections from the same client.
      Engine Driver sends device name (see 'N'), so it may or may not be
      unique. WiThrottle app uses a generated unique identifier.</p>

      <h3>'N' Device Name</h3>

      <p>Sets the name that will appear in the WiThrottle window.
      In Engine Driver, this is the throttle name that you can set.
      The syntax is <code>N<i>name</i></code>, where <i>name</i>
      can be any text, except for a newline, as the newline
      terminates the command. For example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
NJohn's Throttle
</pre>

      <p>Reply: <code>*</code><i>StopSeconds</i></p>
      <pre class="code">
*10
</pre>

      <p>The number after '*' indicates how often your throttle
      will need to send a command or heartbeat (0 means a heartbeat
      is not required). JMRI will send an EStop to the locomotive
      if it hasn't received a command or heartbeat within the
      number of seconds provided.</p>

      <h3>'*' Heartbeat</h3>

      <p>There are three versions of this command:</p>

      <table class="data">
        <tr>
          <td>Command</td>

          <td>Description</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>*</td>

          <td>Send heartbeat</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>*+</td>

          <td>Turn heartbeat monitoring on</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>*-</td>

          <td>Turn heartbeat monitoring off</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>The idea of the heartbeat is that JMRI will issue an
      emergency stop if it has not received any commands from your
      throttle within the heartbeat period. When you set your
      throttle name, using the N command, JMRI returns the
      emergency stop delay, in seconds, but it doesn't turn
      heartbeat monitoring on until you explicitly tell it to do
      so. Once you've turned it on, your throttle will need to
      ensure it sends periodic heartbeat commands (or any other
      command) to keep your engine(s) alive.</p>

      <h3>M - MultiThrottle Controller</h3>

      <p>The 'M' command is for a "multi" throttle, and is handled
      by the <a href=
      "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/ThrottleController.java">
      ThrottleController</a> class.</p>

      <p>The 'M' multithrottle
      can handle more than one locomotive. Engine Driver uses this
      feature, for example, to make it super easy to create a
      consist on the fly with any set of engines (without using DCC
      consisting). You can have one or more multithrottles, and
      each multithrottle can have more than one locomotives
      attached to it. The first character after the 'M' is used as
      a key for the instance of MultiThrottle to use. Engine Driver
      uses '0' through '6' as its keys for multithrottle
      instances. However, you can use other characters for
      the key, 'T' is used in the examples below.</p>

      <h4>MultiThrottle Elements</h4>

      <p>The command string after the first two characters is
      passed to the MultiThrottle for further processing. As in
      other cases, the commands are arrays, where the "&lt;;&gt;"
      string is used as the delimiter. For example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
MT+L341&lt;;&gt;ED&amp;RGW 341
</pre>

      <p>Contains the array elements "+L341" and "ED&amp;RGW 341"
      (after removing the first two letters of the command).</p>

      <p>The first character of the first element describes the
      MultiThrottle command, and is one of the following:</p>

      <table class="data">
        <tr>
          <th>3rd Char</th>

          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>A</td>

          <td>Action. The following characters provide more
          details</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>+</td>

          <td>Add a locomotive to the throttle</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>-</td>

          <td>Remove a locomotive from the throttle</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>S</td>

          <td>Request steal locomotive (see more below)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Each of these operations is described in sections
      below.</p>

      <p>The second element will be passed onto the
      ThrottleController instance for further processing, and the
      details are described below in the Throttle Controller
      section.</p>

      <h5>'+' -- Add Locomotive</h5>The following command is a
      request to add a new locomotive to the multithrottle:
      <pre class="code">
MT+S3&lt;;&gt;ED&amp;RGW 341
</pre>

      <p>The first element is "+S3" has the '+' to indicate that
      this is a request to add a locomotive to the multithrottle.
      The rest of the string is another key, formatted like an address
      (e.g., "S3" or "L341"), which will be used in future references
      by MultiThrottle commands.</p>

      <p>The second element is the actual address to select, using
      either the address directly ("S79" or "L3002") or by referencing
      a roster entry using the "E" command (such as "ED&amp;RGW 341").</p>

      <p>The key address MUST match the address chosen via the
      third element of the string (after the &lt;;&gt;).  Any mismatch
      results in undefined behavior (and is known to vary between
      implementations).</p>

      <p>The reply from this command is quite verbose, and contains
      details about this locomotive as known by JMRI. If the engine
      number is in JMRI's roster, it will return information like
      the following:</p>

      <p>If, on the other hand, JMRI does not have the engine
      number in it's roster, it returns information like the
      following:</p>
      <pre class="code">
MT+L341&lt;;&gt;

MTAL341&lt;;&gt;F01

MTAL341&lt;;&gt;s1
</pre>

      <p class="note">the examples above are all replies from the
      multithrottle.</p>

      <p>The reply consists of the following sections:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Function labels</li>

        <li>Function states (pressed or released)</li>

        <li>Current speed</li>

        <li>Current direction</li>

        <li>Current speed step mode</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For all except the function labels, see the appropriate
      throttle commands, such as 'V' below, for details.</p>

      <p>The function labels are an array of strings, with ]\[ used
      as the array delimiter. So in the example above, F0 is called
      Headlight, F1 Bell, etc. Note that, unlike with other arrays,
      the array delimiter appears at the start and end of the
      array, as well as between elements.</p>

      <h5>'-' -- Remove Locomotive</h5>

      <p>The '-' command removes an engine from a multithrottle.
      Engine Driver, for example, sends the following command to
      release all locomotives from the 'T' throttle:</p>
      <pre class="code">
MT-*&lt;;&gt;r
</pre>

      <p>The first element after the '-' character is the key of
      the locomotive to remove, or '*' to remove <i>all</i>
      locomotives from the multithrottle instance. The
      multithrottle instance will loop through all of it's throttle
      instances and send the 'r' command to each one. The 'r'
      command is a release command.</p>

      <h5>'A' -- Locomotive Action</h5>

      <p>This command passes the second element in the array to
      either a specific throttle (if you specify a key), or to all
      of the throttles in the multithrottle instance if you
      provide '*' as the key. For example:</p>
      <pre class="code">
MTA*&lt;;&gt;qR
</pre>

      <p>The characters after the 'A' in the first element are the
      key to a locomotive in the multithrottle, or '*' to send the
      command to all of the locomotives. In the example above,
      Engine Driver is sending a "qR" command to all of the
      locomotives on the 'T' throttle.</p>

      <h2>Throttle Controller Commands</h2>

      <p>This section describes throttle commands, which are
      the second element of 'Mx' commands (as described above). After
      the command prefix, the next letter is one of the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>'C' consist</li>

        <li>'c' consist lead from roster entry</li>

        <li>'d' dispatch.</li>

        <li>'E' sets an address from a roster entry. Format
        E<i>ID</i>.</li>

        <li>'F' function key. Format F<i>{0|1}</i><i>Function</i>.</li>

        <li>'f' force function</li>

        <li>'I' idle, which sets the speed to 0</li>

        <li>'L' sets a long DCC address.</li>

        <li>'m' momentary</li>

        <li>'q' ask for current settings, such as speed or
        direction</li>

        <li>'Q' quit</li>

        <li>'R' set direction. Format R<i>{0|1}</i>.</li>

        <li>'r' release.</li>

        <li>'S' sets a short DCC address.</li>

        <li>'s' set speed step mode</li>

        <li>'V' sets the speed (velocity). Format V<i>speed.</i></li>

        <li>'X' emergency stop.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each of the commands is described in a section below when
      it takes additional information. Some commands, such as 'X'
      require no additional information.</p>

      <h3>'C' and 'c' Set lead loco for consist</h3>

      <p>These two commands both allow you to set the lead loco to
      which function commands will be sent. This is used in cases where
      you're not using CV21 and CV22 to determine how locos in an
      advanced consist should respond to functions.</p>

      <pre class="code">
MTAL341&lt;;&gt;CL346
</pre>

      <h3>'d' Dispatch and 'r' Release</h3>

      <p>For most DCC systems, these are the same thing; if in
      doubt, use release. Device server will then send a
      remove address command to the mobile device.</p>

      <pre class="code">
MT-L341&lt;;&gt;r
MT-L341&lt;;&gt;d
</pre>

      <p>You can also release or dispatch all of the locomotives
      under control of the current throttle:</p>

      <pre class="code">
MT-*&lt;;&gt;r
</pre>

      <p>After sending this command, the WiThrottle Server will
      typically reply with a removed message</p>

      <pre class="code">
MT-L341&lt;;&gt;
</pre>

      <h3>'F' Function</h3>

      <p>Function keys have two states. Either they're pushed down
      (when you're pushing with your finger), or they're up (when
      you release them). Therefore, when you send function
      commands, you'll send a pair--first when the button is pushed
      down and second when the button is released. Here is an
      example of a pair of messages (usually with some time in
      between them):</p>
      <pre class="code">
MTA*&lt;;&gt;F112
MTA*&lt;;&gt;F012
</pre>

      <p>The first command is when you push F12, and the second is
      when you release the F12 button. Although this example sends
      to all of the 'T' throttles, you can send a function to just
      one by providing the key you used when you added an
      engine.</p>

      <p class="note">Some functions, such as whistle, remain
      active only while you have the button down, while others,
      like lights, are toggle. In both cases, your code should send
      both the push (1) and release (0) and JMRI will map that into
      the correct DCC command or commands, as appropriate.</p>

      <h3>'R' Set Direction</h3>

      <p>Used to change between forward and reverse:</p>

      <table class="data">
        <tr>
          <td>R0</td>

          <td>Reverse</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>R1</td>

          <td>Forward. Actually, any value other than 0 after the R
          is considered forward</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>'V' Set Speed</h3>

      <p>Set the speed to a value between 0 and 126. The format
      looks something like this:</p>
      <pre class="code">
MTA*&lt;;&gt;V30
</pre>

      <p>If the value received from the WiThrottle Server is negative (e.g., during the
         initialization information when an address is selected), that indicates the
         address is in Emergency Stop mode.</p>

    <h3>'S' Steal Locomotive</h3>

    <p>Requests stealing a locomotive. This is a feature that is of most
        interest when working with Digitrax command stations and allows the WiThrottle protocol
        to support the same steal scenario supported by Digitrax throttles.
        </p>

        <p>Stealing a loco takes a few steps. Here is the sequence</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Send a normal (MT+) command to acquire a locomotive</li>
      <li>
        WiThrottle Server sends back a steal (MTS) reply, indicating that a
        steal request is required
      </li>
      <li>Send a steal request (MTS) for the locomotive</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here is an example</p>

    <table class="data">
      <tr>
        <th>From WiThrottle Server (JMRI)</th>
        <th>From Client</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>MT+L341&lt;;&gt;L341</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>MTSL341&lt;;&gt;L341</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>MTSL341&lt;;&gt;L341</td>
      </tr>
      </table>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Steal requires JMRI 4.10 or later</p>

    <h2>Consist Controller Commands</h2>

    <p>The commands in this section are used to work with consists.
    All the consist commands start with "RC", which stands for
    Roster Consist.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>'P' Change order of locos in the consist</li>

      <li>'R' Delete (remove) a consist</li>

      <li>'+' Add loco to a consist and/or set the relative direction</li>

      <li>'-' Remove a loco from the consist</li>

      <li>'F' Program CV21 and CV22 function behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>'+' Add to Consist</h3>

    <p>Either creates a consist or adds a locomotive to an existing
    consist. As an example, let's say that consist S74 does <b>not</b>
    exist. The following commands will create a consist with named
    "My consist" with two locos:</p>

    <pre class="code">
RC+&lt;;&gt;S74&lt;;&gt;My consist&lt;:&gt;L341&lt;;&gt;true
RC+&lt;;&gt;S74&lt;;&gt;My consist&lt;:&gt;L342&lt;;&gt;true
</pre>

    <p>The parts of this command are as follows:</p>

    <table class="data">
      <tr>
        <td>S74</td>
        <td>The DCC address of the consist</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>My consist</td>
        <td>The JMRI id (name) of the consist</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>L341</td>
        <td>DCC address of the loco to add to the consist</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>true</td>
        <td>Direction is normal (false for reversed)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>'-' Remove Loco from Consist</h3>

    <p>Removes a single locomotive from the consist. For example:</p>

    <pre class="code">
RC-&lt;;&gt;S74&lt;:&gt;L341
</pre>

    <p>Removes DCC address L341 from the consist with the DCC address
    of S74.</p>

    <h3>'P' Change Position in Consist</h3>

    <p>This command is used to change the order of locos in a consist.
    These commands have the following format:</p>

    <pre class="code">
RCP&lt;;&gt;consistAddress&lt;:&gt;leadLoco&lt;;&gt;nextLoco&lt;;&gt;...* ...&lt;;&gt;nextLoco&lt;;&gt;trailLoco
</pre>

    <p>Notice that this has no direction infromation--it just has a
    list of locomotive DCC addresses. For example:</p>

    <pre class="code">
RCP&lt;;&gt;S74&lt;:&gt;L346&lt;;&gt;L3374
</pre>

    <p>The example sets the position of the locos in the consist with
    the DCC address of S74 so that DCC L346 is the lead and L3374 is
    the trailing loco.</p>

    <h3>'R' Remove Consist</h3>

    <p>Deletes a consist. For example, the following command deletes
    the consist with DCC address S74.</p>

    <pre class="code">
RCR&lt;;&gt;S74
    </pre>

    <h3>Fast Clock Commands</h3>

    <p>The 'PFT' command is used to synchronize the fast clock time.  It is
    sent periodically from the server, indicating the "now" time and
    (optionally) the current time ratio.  Examples include:</p>

    <pre class="code">
PFT65871&lt;;&gt;4
PFT1550686525&lt;;&gt;4.0
PFT1550686860
</pre>

    <p>The first number is an integer number of seconds since 12:00
    midnight, January 1st, 1970.  This start date is the Unix time epoch,
    and makes it easy to convert this value using the standard time
    libraries.  Only the hours and minutes are useful.  JMRI sends a value
    based on the system time when the fast clock was started, so will
    return a value near the calendar date.   The Digitrax LnWI returns
    values within the range 0-86400 (all the values for January 1,
    1970).</p>

    <p>The second number, if present, is the current fast time ratio.  It
    may be an integer value (4) or a floating point value (4.0).  If this
    value is 0 (or 0.0), the clock is stopped.</p>

    <p>JMRI will update the current fast time every 5 real-time minutes,
    while the LnWI does so much more frequently.</p>


    <h3>Unknown commands</h3>

    <p>Any command that is not recognized by a client should be ignored,
    with processing continuing after the next newlines.</p>

    <h3>Observations</h3>

    <p>The Digitrax LnWI sends multiple instances of the H command as part
    of the initial information sent after the first command the client sends:</p>

    <pre class="code">
HTDigitrax
HtDigitrax LnWi 1.0 Unit=7,Wifi Chnl= 1,Command Station= DCS100
</pre>

    <p>and after a selection attempt when using a long address for what
    would be a short address values (say <code>MT+L23&lt;;&gt;L23</code>) the
    response is:</p>

    <pre class="code">
HM error - long address &lt; 127 S23
</pre>

    <p>The LnWI also sends a <code>PFC</code> command.  Its purpose is
    unknown at this time.</p>
