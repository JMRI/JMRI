<h1> 
JMRI: WiFi Throttle Communications Protocol
</h1>

This page describes the protocol provided by the
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/package-summary.html">jmri.jmrit.withrottle</a>
package for controlling trains through JMRI via 
a TCP/IP link.



<p>
Open a TCP/IP link to the port advertised via ZeroConf/Bonjour
as the servicve "_withrottle._tcp.local.".

<p>
The first letter is interpreted by the DeviceServer class to determine
where to send the rest of the package.
<ol>
    <li>
        'T' sends to the throttle controller class.
    </li>
    <li>
        'N' is the device name.
    </li>
    <li>
        'Q' indicates the device has quit, close its window.
    </li>
    <li>
        'C' is not used anymore and forwards to the throttle controller.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
<h3>
    Throttle Controller:
</h3>
<p>
These would follow the 'T'
<p>
Send Laddr, or Saddr to allocate
a throttle.  "L" means Long DCC address, "S" means Short DCC
address. e.g. TL345 will tell the throttle controller to
request long address 345. When the address is set, the Device Server
will send out the acquired address to the mobile device.

<p>
R0 is reverse, R1 is forward. e.g. TR1 tells throttle controller
to set direction forward.

<p>
Viii sets speed, where iii is an integer value between 0 and 126.
e.g. TV63 will have the throttle controller set the speed value
to 50%

<p>
'r' and 'd' "release" and "dispatch" the throttle.  For most
DCC systems, these are the same thing; if in doubt, use release.
Device server will then send "Not Set" to the mobile device.

<p>
Function buttons are not latched by the connected mobile device.
Instead the packages sent from the device to JMRI indicate when
a button is pressed, and when it is released. The format is 'F'
followed by 0 or 1 for released and pressed, followed by the
function number. e.g. TF13 says the button for function 3 is pressed,
and TF03 is sent when the button for function 3 is released. The
throttle controller then checks to see if that function is momentary,
and handles it accordingly.
