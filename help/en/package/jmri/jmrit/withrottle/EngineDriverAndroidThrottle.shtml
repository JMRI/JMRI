JMRI: Engine Driver Throttle for Android

<div style="float:left;padding:8px"><a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org" title="Visit EngineDriver homepage"><img src="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org/sites/enginedriver.rrclubs.org/files/images/engine_driver_icon.png"></a></div>
<p>This free application can connect to a <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml" target="_blank">JMRI WiThrottle</a> server running on a computer, and in turn control your locomotives. Speed, direction, and up to 29 DCC functions are supported for one or two locomotives. &nbsp;You can also control layout power, turnouts and routes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For screenshots, installation and usage details, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org/" target="_blank">[Homepage for EngineDriver]</a>.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
<p>An Android device running OS 1.6 or later, with WiFi, plus access to Android Market OR ability to manually install .apk files.<br />
Verify your Android device can connect to your PC network via WiFi and obtain an IP address.<br />Make sure you are running one of the latest versions of&nbsp;<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">JMRI</a>&nbsp;(2.8 works, 2.12 works better) on your PC, connected to the layout. &nbsp;Start up JMRI and verify you can use the included "Throttle" app to control a loco.</p>
<h3>Operation:</h3>
<p>Start the <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml" target="_blank">WiThrottle</a> function of JMRI, located in DecoderPro under Tools, Throttles. &nbsp;(Or under Debug in older versions of JMRI).</p>
<p>On your phone, start the Engine Driver app and wait for your PC's address to show up in "Discovered Services". <br />Click on the discovered address, (or you can enter the address and port of your WiThrottle server directly).</p>
<p>On the throttle screen, click on the "Press to Select" loco button for each loco.<br />On the next screen, enter the loco address (verify short or long), and press "Acquire". &nbsp;You will be returned to the Throttle screen.<br />Repeat using 2nd "Press to Select" button to acquire a 2nd loco.</p>
<p>Operate your loco using the slider for speed, and the reverse, stop and forward buttons to control direction. <br />To release all locos, just press the Back button.  This will also stop your loco (can be overridden in preferences).</p>
<p>Press your phone's Menu button to access screens for Turnout, Route and Power control, as well as adjust settings and setup default function labels.<br />
You can also "fling" left and right to quickly switch between Throttle, Turnout and Route screens.</p>
<h3>Configuration:</h3>
<p>Under Preferences, set the name you'd like to call your throttle. &nbsp;(Must be unique if multiple EngineDrivers in use) &nbsp;You can turn off the "stop on release" feature if desired, and you can set a Maximum value for the throttle sliders. &nbsp;If you're planning to use Turnout control, make sure you select the correct Hardware System from the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Function Buttons menu option to set the labels and function numbers to display. If you have set labels in a roster entry in JMRI, these labels can be copied from the dialog (access the menu after selecting a loco). &nbsp;Remove buttons by blanking out the labels. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the JMRI computer side, check your WiThrottle preferences to insure you allow or disallow the control features desired. &nbsp;If you've defined your turnouts and routes in a panel, make sure to specify "user names" for those you'd like to see listed on your throttle. &nbsp;You can also "filter" the turnouts shown using the WiThrottle-&gt;Filter Controls option in the WiThrottle window. &nbsp;Turning on "Use eStop" and "Use fixed port#" are also recommended.</p>
<p>Entering roster entries, routes and defining turnouts in JMRI will all make your Engine Driver throttle easier to use (though not required).</p>
