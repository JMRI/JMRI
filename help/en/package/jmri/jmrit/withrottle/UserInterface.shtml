			<h1>JMRI: WiFi Connected Throttle</h1>
			The WiThrottle window controls the connection between WiFi throttles,
			e.g. an iPhone, iPod Touch, or Android Phone, and JMRI.

			<p>
				It can be set to start automatically with the "<a
					href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Startup">Start Up</a>"
				section in the "<a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">JMRI
					Preferences</a>".
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#WiThrottle">Preferences</a>
				for the WiFi throttles can be found in the JMRI Preferences under
				the heading WiThrottle.
			</p>

			<p>This utility broadcasts its connection information across all
				local networks, so it can be picked up by any device looking for the
				service. This eliminates having to enter connection information into
				the device. If the computer running JMRI is protected by a software
				firewall, you may need to add an exception for JMRI or disable the
				firewall to allow the WiFi throttle to connect.</p>

			<p>When using a WiFi throttle, if the computer enters sleep mode,
				control will be lost. System preferences may need to be adjusted to
				prevent the computer from putting itself to sleep when it is
				inactive.</p>

			<p>
				You can use any of these devices via the same or a different
				(remote) network than the one that your JMRI computer is running on.
				See <a href="#remote">below</a> for more information on <a
					href="#remote">remote use of mobile devices</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The protocol is described on a <a href="Protocol.shtml">separate
					page</a>. For more on JMRI networking, see the <a
					href="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Networking.shtml">networking
					technical page</a>.

			<h3>Function Labels</h3>
			Function labels can be customized for each roster entry through JMRI,
			using the Labels &amp; Media button. These labels will then be
			displayed in place of the generic F1, F2... on the screen of the
			mobile device. The labels can be added when a new roster entry is
			created, or by editing an existing roster entry under the Function
			Labels tab.

			<h3>Routes &amp; Turnouts</h3>
			The app can control any turnouts (and routes) that JMRI can
			control.Additionally, you can limit what turnouts appear. In JMRI,
			with the WiThrottle window active, there is a menu named WiThrottle.
			It has an item titled "Routes and Turnouts" that will let you pick
			which items to display or hide.

			<h3>Advanced Consisting</h3>
			There are now two options for how Advanced (or Decoder Assisted)
			Consisting is handled. This can be selected from the <a
				href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#WiThrottle">WiThrottle</a>
			portion of JMRI Preferences.

			<p>
				The default is <b>NMRA Format</b>. This will build a consist using
				NMRA consisting commands. It does not use any techniques specific to
				the connected DCC system. This allows WiFi throttles to work in a
				DCC manufacturer independent way. These consists may perform better
				for building and controlling with WiFi devices.
			</p>

			<p>
				The second option is <b>DCC Brand-Specific</b> which will build
				consists in a manner where they will function as though built using
				a throttle from the DCC manufacturer. This will follow manufacturer
				specific features as to how consists are built and controlled. These
				consists should perform better when built with a WiFi device, but
				controlled by a throttle from the DCC manufacturer of your system.
			</p>

			<h2>
				<a name="remote"></a>Using A Remote Mobile Device Throttle
			</h2>

			<p>Typically, people using smartphones or tablets as throttles
				are physically in the same room as the layout they are controlling.
				Mobile device throttles, however, can be operated from anywhere in
				the world, significantly adding to the fun of model railroading by
				making it possible to share control of a layout with family or
				friends many miles away.</p>

			<p>Setting up a mobile device throttle is straighforward, as
				discussed above. Apps such as the similarly named WiThrottle (for
				IOS devices) and EngineDriver (for Android devices) will either
				recognize that JMRI WiThrottle Server is transmitting or ask you to
				connect to the server manually by entering its IP address and port.
				The WiThrottle Server displays its broadcast IP address and port in
				the top section of the WiThrottle window. If you are using a typical
				home router, this will begin with 192 or 10 and consist of four
				parts, for example 192.168.0.103. This "internal" IP address will
				only be recognized by other devices connecting to the same local
				network.</p>

			<p>
				Setting up for a remote mobile device throttle requires some
				additional steps. If the mobile device you are going to use as a
				throttle is connecting to a different network than your local
				network (as, for example, is obviously the case if the remote
				operator is in another city), that mobile device will have to be
				told the "external" or "public" address of your JMRI computer and a
				port number that will allow it to connect remotely to your JMRI
				computer. You can look up the public IP address for your local
				router either by logging into the router's administrative portal or
				using a browser on your JMRI computer to go to the web site <a
					href="https://whatismypublicip.com">WhatIsMyPublicIP.com</a> or
				similar. You then have to create a link between that IP address and
				a port number to the internal IP address and port number of the JMRI
				WiThrottle Server. This is called "port forwarding" and needs to be
				set up on your local router. Setting up port forwarding varies with
				the model of router so we won't attempt to give specific
				instructions on how to do that. However, detailed instructions can
				usually be found on the internet and the topic has been addressed in
				the JMRI online forum as well.
			</p>

			<p>Once you have determined the public address of your JMRI
				computer and set up port forwarding to the WiThrottle Server, you
				enter this information into the throttle app on your mobile device.
				You will know you have been successful when your mobile device's
				name appears in the WiThrottle Server window and your engine roster
				appears on your app.
			<p>TROUBLESHOOTING: if you get an error or your mobile device app
				doesn't appear to connect, check that you have the correct internal
				and public IP addresses (which may change from day to day due to the
				way your network router and internet service provider assign
				addresses), correct port number, and that you saved the port
				forwarding information to your router's memory.</p>

			<p>Now all you have to do is provide a way for the remote
				engineer to talk with you and see your layout while he or she takes
				control of your JMRI-enabled layout via a mobile device throttle
				from anywhere in the world! [FYI: use FaceTime or Skype or some
				other video system that provides realtime communication for this
				purpose. It is generally not recommended to use remote monitoring
				cameras such as are used for baby monitoring or security cameras as
				most introduce a several second delay -- something that could lead
				to some very interesting railroad accidents!]</p>
