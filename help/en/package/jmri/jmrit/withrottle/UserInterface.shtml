This window controls the connection between WiFi throttles, 
e.g. an iPhone or iPod Touch, and JMRI.  It can be set as an
"Action at Startup" in the "Show Advanced Preferences" section
of JMRI Preferences.

<p>
This utility broadcasts its connection information across the local 
network, so it can be picked up by any device looking for 
the service.  This eliminates having to enter connection information 
into the device.  If the computer running JMRI is protected by a
software firewall, you may need to disable the firewall to allow
the WiFi throttle to connect.
<p>

When using a WiFi throttle, if the computer enters sleep mode,
control will be lost. System preferences may need to be adjusted
to prevent the computer from putting itself to sleep when it is inactive.

<P>

The first use of this is the
<a href="http://withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a>
for iPhone and iPod Touch.

<p>
The protocol is described on a 
<a href="Protocol.shtml">separate page</a>.
