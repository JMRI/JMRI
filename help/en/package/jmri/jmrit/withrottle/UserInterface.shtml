This window controls the connection between WiFi throttles, 
e.g. an iPhone, iPod Touch, or Android Phone, and JMRI.  


<p>
It can be set to start automatically with the 
"<a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#actions">Action at Startup</a>" section in the 
"<a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">Show Advanced Preferences</a>"
section of JMRI Preferences.

<p>
<a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#WiThrottle">Preferences</a>
for the WiFi throttles can also be found in the JMRI Preferences
under the heading WiThrottle.

<p>
This utility broadcasts its connection information across the local 
network, so it can be picked up by any device looking for 
the service.  This eliminates having to enter connection information 
into the device.  If the computer running JMRI is protected by a
software firewall, you may need to disable the firewall to allow
the WiFi throttle to connect.

<p>
When using a WiFi throttle, if the computer enters sleep mode,
control will be lost. System preferences may need to be adjusted
to prevent the computer from putting itself to sleep when it is inactive.

<P>
To use your iPhone or iPod Touch with JMRI as a throttle, you
run the 
<a href="http://withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a>
app on the iPhone or iPod Touch. The basic application is
available for free download from the iTunes store.

</a>
To use your Android phone with JMRI as a throttle, you
run the 
<a href="EngineDriverAndroidThrottle.shtml">Engine Driver</a>
program on the Android phone.

<p>
The protocol is described on a 
<a href="Protocol.shtml">separate page</a>.
For more on JMRI networking, see the 
<a href="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Networking.shtml">networking technical page</a>.
