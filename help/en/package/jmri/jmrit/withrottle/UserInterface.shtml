<h1> 
JMRI: WiFi Throttle
</h1>

This window controls the connection between WiFi throttles, 
e.g. an iPhone, iPod Touch, or Android Phone, and JMRI.  

<p>
It can be set to start automatically with the 
"<a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Startup">Start Up</a>" section in the
"<a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">JMRI Preferences</a>".

<p>
<a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#WiThrottle">Preferences</a>
for the WiFi throttles can be found in the JMRI Preferences
under the heading WiThrottle.

<p>
This utility broadcasts its connection information across the local 
network, so it can be picked up by any device looking for 
the service.  This eliminates having to enter connection information 
into the device.  If the computer running JMRI is protected by a
software firewall, you may need to disable the firewall to allow
the WiFi throttle to connect.

<p>
When using a WiFi throttle, if the computer enters sleep mode,
control will be lost. System preferences may need to be adjusted
to prevent the computer from putting itself to sleep when it is inactive.

<P>
To use your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with JMRI as a throttle, you
run the 
<a href="http://withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a>
app on the iPhone or iPod Touch. The basic application is
available for free download from the iTunes store.  

<P>
To use your Android device with JMRI as a throttle, you
run the 
<a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org">Engine Driver</a>
program or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.digitools.digitrains">Digitrains</a> 
on the Android device.  These free apps are available from the 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jmri.enginedriver">
Google&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Store</a> or the 
<a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org">EngineDriver&nbsp;site</a>

<p>
The protocol is described on a 
<a href="Protocol.shtml">separate page</a>.
For more on JMRI networking, see the 
<a href="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Networking.shtml">networking technical page</a>.

<p>
You can also 
<a href="../webThrottle/webThrottle.shtml">use a web browser</a>
in your device to 
<a href="../webThrottle/webThrottle.shtml">run trains</a>
if for some reason you can't install an app on the device.

<h3>
Function Labels
</h3>
Function labels can be customized for each roster entry through JMRI.
These labels will then be displayed in place of the generic F1, F2... on the
screen of the mobile device.
The labels can be added when a new roster entry is created,
or by editing an existing roster entry under the Function Labels tab.
To enter function labels, the programmer format has to be either "Advanced" or "Custom".


<p>
<h3>
Routes & Turnouts
</h3>
The app can control any turnouts (and routes) that JMRI has control of.
If they are available in the JMRI turnout (or route) table,
they are automatically available in WiFi throttles.�
If there are no turnouts (or routes) on the table(s),
then the control screen for them does not show in the app.
It will do all of this by default.
However, if JMRI cannot control them, WiFi throttles will not be able to either.

<p>
Additionally, you can limit what turnouts appear.
In JMRI, with the WiThrottle window active, there is a menu named WiThrottle.
It has an item titled "Filter Controls"
that will let you pick which turnouts to display or hide.

<p>
<h3>
Advanced Consisting
</h3>
There are now two options for how Advanced (or Decoder Assisted) Consisting is handled. 
This can be selected from the <a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#WiThrottle">WiThrottle</a> portion of JMRI Preferences. 

<p>

The default is <b>NMRA Format</b>. This will build a consist using NMRA consisting commands. 
It does not use any techniques specific to the connected DCC system. 
This allows WiFi throttles to work in a DCC manufacturer independent way. 
These consists may perform better for building and controlling with WiFi devices.

<p>
The second option is <b>DCC Brand-Specific</b> which will build consists in a manner 
where they will function as though built using a throttle from the DCC manufacturer. 
This will follow manufacturer specific features as to how consists are built and controlled. 
These consists should perform better when built with a WiFi device, but controlled by a 
throttle from the DCC manufacturer of your system.
