<H2>JMRI Operations</H2>

The operations program allows you to build computer generated train
manifests for your railroad. A train manifest details the work that a
train will perform during an operations session. The manifest provides a
list of car pickup and drops and shows where the car's are located and
where they should be eventually positioned on the railroad. The program
allows you to build a roster of cars, define locations on the railroad,
and routes for trains to travel. The car roster includes information
about the car, including road name, number, type of car, color, length,
weight, date built, and owner. Trains are assigned routes that define
locations where cars can be picked up or dropped. Features include the
ability to control what car types and car road names a location can
service, the available track space for a location, and the maximum
length the train can be between any two locations on the route.
<P>
Locations can have sidings, yards, staging and interchange tracks.
Optionally, trains can be configured to require a caboose or car with
FRED. The program generates manifests for each train and optionally a
switch list for any location. A switch list for a location shows the
work for all of the scheduled trains that will visit that location. The
program can also place icons representing trains on a JMRI panel. The
icon can be taught to move in the panel along with the train from
location to location. </P>
<P>
The operations program is included in the JMRI/DecoderPro suite of tools 
and can be found under the main menu heading "Tools->Operations".</P>

<P>

</P>

<A name="demo"></A>
<H3>Operations Demo Files</H3>

The operations program provides a set of demo files to help introduce
you to the some of the features and capabilities of this program. To
load the demo files, first open the Operations Settings panel
"Tools->Operations->Settings", and in the upper left corner of the
Setting panel is the Tools menu, select "Load Demo Files". The program
will create a <A HREF="#BackupRestore">backup</A> of your current
configuration if you have one, and then load the demo files. Restart
JMRI to complete the demo load process.

<P>The program also supplies a simple panel to show how the train
icons work. Load the panel before building the trains by selecting in
the main JMRI menu, "Panels->Load Panels .." a window should appear and
open the "operations" directory and then open the "Operations Demo
Panel" xml file.
</P>
<H3>Quick Start Help</H3>

In the top level menu for JMRI find the "Tools->Operations" menu. There
are six items in this menu. We recommend that you start with "Settings"
and work your way down to "Trains". We also recommend that when defining
your locations that you first use yard and siding tracks, and try
staging and interchange tracks when you're more comfortable with how the
program operates.

<H3>British Railways</H3>

The program supports an alternate set of railway terminology for our
British modelers. To use British terminologies, go to the JMRI Advanced
Preferences (Edit->Preferences.. select the Show Advanced Preferences
checkbox) and select English (United Kingdom) in the "Locale:" menu
box. The program will also convert from centimeters to meters when
entering wagon, locomotive, or location lengths, just append "cm" to any
length. 

<A NAME="Settings"></A>
<H2>Settings</H2>

The Settings panel contains general parameters for the operations
program. Select from the JMRI main window "Tools->Operations->Settings"
to open the Settings panel. The Setting panel has fields and buttons to
allow you to enter your railroad name, the directions your train's
travel, the scale that you are using, printer and icon controls, and the
ability to create backups and restore files for operations.
<P>
<img src="images/Settings.png">
</P>
<H3>Railroad Name</H3>

Enter your railroad name in the field across from "Railroad Name". This
name will show up on your manifests.

<H3>Train Directions</H3>

If your railroad depicts trains traveling north and south select the
"North/South" box, if your trains travel east and west select the
"East/West" box. You must select at least one direction, and can if
desired select both.

<H3>Maximum Train Length</H3>

Now enter the default "Maximum Train Length" you desire for your trains.
This field provides the maximum default train length between cities.
Later you can override this length if you wish a shorter train between
any two locations. A 1000 foot train can carry approximately 20 cars,
and is of course dependent on the car lengths assigned to the train.

<H3>Maximum Number of Engines</H3>

Now set the maximum number of engines that you want the program to
assign to a train. If you don't want the program assigning engines, set
this value to 0.

<H3>Switch and Travel Times</H3>

The program when generating switch lists for the various locations on
your railroad, will estimate the arrival times for your trains based on
the train's departure time and the switch and travel times. Enter the
average number of minutes it takes to drop or pickup a car on your
railroad. Then enter the average amount of time in minutes it takes to
travel from one location to the another.

<H3>Scale</H3>

Next select the scale you are modeling. This is useful when you enter
the length of cars and tracks. You can enter the number of actual inches
and the program will convert to scale feet. Append a double quote to the
length when entering actual inches. The program will also automatically
assign the proper NMRA weight for a car based on scale and length.

<H3>Car Types</H3>

The program has two sets of car types for you to use. Descriptive
provides type names like "Boxcar" and "Tankcar", and AAR provides type
names like "XM" and "T" for boxcars and tank cars respectively. Select
the one that you prefer.

<H3>Owner Name</H3>

You can optionally enter your name in the "Owner" field.

<H3>Build Option</H3>

There are two build options, normal and aggressive. It is recommended
that you select normal when you first begin using the program. Normal
builds guarantee that when a car is delivered (dropped) that there will
be track space available for the car. 

<P>
Aggressive builds makes the car's track space available as soon as a
car is scheduled for a pickup. Therefore there can be instances where a
train was to pickup a car to vacate the track, but a "later" scheduled
train arrives early with a drop to that track and the car hasn't been
picked up. However, more often than not the same train will perform the
pickup and drop thus minimizing the number of conflicts. Aggressive also
performs a two pass determination of car movements. The net effect is
that more cars are moved within a given train. Aggressive also tends to
deliver cars to all of the available sidings. The smaller the siding,
yard, or interchange the more likely that the program will assign cars
to that track.
</P>
<P>
Note that once you've built a train, the build option can not be changed until
all trains are terminated or reset. 
</P>
<H3>Add Operations Menu to Main Menu</H3>

When selected, add the operations menu to the main menu bar. The
operations menu will appear the next time you restart JMRI.

<H3>Panel Options (Train Icons)</H3>

If you want the operations program to place an icon representing the
train on a panel, enter the panel's name (NOT the panel's file path
name!), otherwise leave the name blank to disable. 
Load the panel using the main menu "Panel->Load Panels..." or use other
load panel options available in JMRI.

<P>The "Enable Train Icon SetX&Y" when selected allows you to teach
the operations program where to place the train icon on your panel when
moving your train from location to location. Deselect this feature after
your done teaching the program to prevent accidentally changing the
train icon's position on your panel. If you also want the lead engine
number as part of your train icon text, select the "Append Engine
Number" box. You can select the background color of your train icon
depending on the train's direction. Select the color desired for each
direction using the pull down menus.</P>
<P>
<img src="images/PanelWithMarkers.png">
</P>

<H3>Save</H3>

When you're finished with the settings panel, press the save button to
store the setting in a file called "Operations.xml". You can find this
file in your JMRI directory in a folder called "operations". The program
will also create a backup file each time you press the save button. 

<A	NAME="BackupRestore"></A>
<H3>Backup and Restore</H3>

The "Backup" button will store a copy of the operation files. The
"Restore" button will prompt you to select which set of backup files you
wish to use to recover your operation files. You must quit and restart
JMRI to complete the restoration of the operation files.

<P>When you press the "Backup" button the program creates a new
directory in operations called "backups", and then stores the operation
files in a directory that is based on the day you pressed the "Backup"
button. For example, if today was November 21, 2008, the program will
create a backup directory named "2008_11_21".  You can also rename the
directory to whatever name you want. This would be useful if you had
more than one railroad that you wanted to manage.</P>

<H3>Reset Databases</H3>

To reset the operation databases to their original defaults, use the
Operations Settings->Tools menu and select "Reset Databases". The "Reset Database"
option will make a backup copy of the current operation files before
deleting them. The results will be that the settings, cars, engines,
locations, and trains databases will be purged.

<A NAME="SettingsOptions"></A>
<H2>Options</H2>

The operations program has several options that can be modified by
selecting Operations Settings->Tools->Options. The first option is Car
Routing, and it is recommended that you leave this enabled. With car
routing enabled, you can use a <A HREF="#Schedules">Schedule</A> to
deliver a car to a specific location. The car routing algorithm will
search for the most efficient route for the car to travel. The algorithm
will attempt to use interchanges and then yards to move cars. Routing
through staging is disabled by default. The algorithm will try and find
a route using a maximum of five trains to complete the car move. 

<A NAME="LoggingOptions"></A>
<H3>Logging Options</H3>

If you want the operations program to log your engine and or car movements to
a file, select the appropriate checkboxes.  The program will create a new
directory called "logger" in the operations directory.  For each day's session
the program will create a new file using the day's date.

<A NAME="PrintOptions"></A>
<H2>Print Options</H2>

You can modify the how the program prints the train manifests and the amount of detail
that the build report provides.  From the "Operations Settings->Tools" menu select "Print Options" to open
the print option window.
<P>
<img src="images/PrintOptions.png">
</P>
<H3>Manifest Printer Font</H3>
The program supports two types of fonts for printing. Select the desired
font using the radio buttons. 

<H3>Show Car Length</H3>

Select the "Show Car Length" checkbox if you want the car's length shown
in your manifests and switch lists.

<H3>Show Car Load</H3>

You can optionally show whether the car is empty or loaded. When a car
is delivered to a siding the load state will change. You can also create
your own loads but there are restrictions. Cars with "loads" other than
empty or loaded can only be serviced by sidings with a 
<A	HREF="#Schedules">Schedule</A>. It is strongly recommended that you not
create your own loads until you become very familiar with how the
program works. For many operators, showing whether the car is empty or
loaded adds just enough realism to their operations.

<H3>Show Car Color</H3>

Select the "Show Car Color" checkbox if you want the car's color shown
in your manifests and switch lists.

<H3>Show Car Destination</H3>

If you want your manifest and switch lists to show the cars destination
when picking it up, select the "Show Car Destination" checkbox. The
program always provides the car's destination when dropping a car from
the train.

<H3>Show Car and Engine Comments</H3>

For each car in your roster, you can have an optional comment. If you
want the car's comment added to your manifest and switch lists, select
the checkbox.

<H3>Drop Text Color</H3>

You can select the text color of your manifest when the operation is to drop off a car.
Select the desired color from the drop down box.

<H3>Pickup Text Color</H3>

You can select the text color of your manifest when the operation is to pick up a car.
Select the desired color from the drop down box.

<H3>Add Logo</H3>

If you want a logo in the top right hand corner of your manifests and switch lists, press
the "Add Logo" button and select a file with the image you want to display.

<A NAME="BuildReportDetails"></A>
<H3>Build Report Details</H3>

You can adjust the amount of information that the build report will
show. Select one of the four levels using the radio buttons. The program
when generating the build reports stores the "Very Detailed" information
to disk. The radio buttons control how much of that data is actually
printed. The "Minimal" radio button provides the least amount of
information and "Very Detailed" provides the most. If you're only
interested why a train won't build, the "Minimal" setting can provide
you with this information. The "Normal" setting shows which engines and
cars are being excluded from the train, and which engines and cars are
being picked up and dropped. The "Detailed" setting will generate quite
a few pages depending on the size of your railroad. It will show all
available cars and engines, and a bit how the program finds destinations
for the cars and engines. The "Very Detailed" setting produces the most
pages, and will show why cars are not picked up or dropped. Be sure and
press "Save" after changing the build report selection.

<A NAME="Locations"></A>
<H2>Locations</H2>

Locations are places on your railroad that trains visit to pickup or
drop off cars and engines. Locations can be cities, towns, or just
places where trains need to work cars. Select
"Tools->Operations->Locations" to add or edit the locations on your
railroad. 

<P>
<img src="images/Locations.png">
</P>
<P>
To add a location, press the "Add" button located on the
bottom of the "Locations" panel. A new panel should appear. 
</P>
<P>
<img src="images/EditLocation.png">
</P>

<P>In the "Add Location" panel, enter the name of the location in
box across from "Name". The location name must be unique; the program
will not allow two locations with identical names. However, if you want
more than one location to have the same name for your manifests and
switch lists, add a hyphen and a number to the locations name. For
example, "Boston-1" and "Boston-2" will print as "Boston". The program
will remove the hyphen and number when printing manifests and switch
lists.</P>

<P>Now press the "Add Location" button at
the bottom of the panel. The various fields that were disabled should
now appear.
</P>
<P>Each location can have several yard, siding, interchange or
staging tracks. Yards are where cars and engines are placed for
temporary storage. A siding can be an industry or any place where a car
is loaded or unloaded. For a train to service a location, there must be
at least one track for that location. See below how to add tracks to
your location.</P>
<P>The tables show the length of the tracks, the amount of track
that is occupied (Used) by cars and engines, the total number of cars
and engines (Rolling Stock) at each location, the number of cars and
engines that will be picked up (Pickups) by trains, and the number of
cars and engines that will be delivered (Drops) by trains.</P>

<H3>Location Service Direction</H3>

You can decide which train direction the location can service. For
example, if only south bound trains can access the location select
"South" and deselect the other directions. This can be useful if you
want to only support trailing point switching for a given location. If a
location can support multiple directions then select the ones that are
appropriate.

<H3>Location Rolling Stock</H3>

You can control the rolling stock a location can service. Push the
"Clear All" button to deselect all types, or "Select All" to select all types,
then select or deselect the rolling stock you wish the location to
accept. After configuring the tracks for a location, you can use the
"Auto Select" button to reflect the rolling stock serviced by the
various tracks.

 <A NAME="Yards"></A>
<H3>Yards</H3>

To add a yard, press the "Add Yard Track" button. Now enter the name of
the yard along with the length of the track in scale feet or in actual
inches. Append a double quote (") to the length when entering actual
inches and the program will convert the length into scale feet. Append
cm if you want to convert from centimeters to meters. Press the "Add
Yard Track" button at the bottom of the panel and the disabled fields
should now appear.

<H3>Rolling Stock Serviced</H3>

You can control what type of rolling stock the yard can service. Note
that the yard rolling stock is restricted to the ones that the location
can service. If the rolling stock that you wish doesn't appear for a
yard, confirm that the location's rolling stock types are properly
selected. If the rolling stock type you want doesn't exist for a
location, you will have to create the type using the "Cars" panels, see
<A HREF="#Cars">Cars</A> below.

<H3>Road Names Serviced</H3>

You can also restrict which roads a yard can service. Select "Accept
Only" if you want to build a list of road names that the yard will
accept. Select "Exclude" if you want to build a list of road names that
you want to exclude from the yard.

<H3>Comment</H3>

You can enter an optional comment for the yard.

<H3>Save Yard Track</H3>

Press the "Save Yard Track" to save your work. The program will create a
file (OperationsLocationRoster.xml) in your JMRI directory in a folder
called "operations". The program will also create a backup file
containing the last settings for all of your locations. 

<A	NAME="Sidings"></A>
<H3>Sidings</H3>

To add a siding, press the "Add Siding" button. Sidings are very similar
to <A HREF="#Yards">Yards</A> , so see above for more information.  You can if
you wish schedule the order that cars will be delivered to a siding.  See
<A HREF="#Schedules">Schedules</A> below for more information.  

<A NAME="Schedules"></A>
<H3>Schedules</H3>

If you would like to see cars delivered in a particular sequence, or
with a specific load for delivery or shipping, the program allows you to
apply a schedule to a siding. This is an optional feature and shouldn't
be used until you become very familiar with how the program generates
manifests and switch lists. A schedule provides very fine control on the
order types of cars will be delivered to a siding. You can also specify
the road name for the type of car delivered. For example, if you wanted
two SP boxcars to be delivered followed by a tank car loaded with "Oil",
you can create a schedule that will do exactly that. To create a
schedule press the "Edit" button next to "Optional Schedule" pull down 
menu on the "Edit Siding Track" panel. Pressing the
"Edit" button should create the "Add Schedule" panel.
<P>
<img src="images/EditSchedule.png">
</P>
<P>Enter a name for your schedule and press the "Add Schedule"
button on the bottom of the panel. Multiple sidings can use the same
schedule as long as the sidings use the same car types and roads. Now
add your first delivery for this siding by selecting a car type in the
menu box found in the lower left corner of the panel and pressing the
"Add car type" button. A new item should appear in your schedule
containing the type of car, a pull down menu for road names, and a count
of 1. You can if you wish specify a particular road for the type of car
you entered, or leave it blank if you don't care about the road name.  You
can also specify the car load received and shipped.
</P>
<P> If
you wanted more than one car type to be delivered consecutively,
increase the count to the number that you wish. The maximum count is 10
and the minimum is 1. Repeat selecting the car types and pressing to
"Add car type" until your have a delivery schedule you like. Press "Save
Schedule" and close the schedule panel when you are done.</P>

<P>Note only car types and roads that are accepted by this siding
are available. If a car type or road isn't available, check the car
types and roads for this siding and location.
</P>
<P>If you want a specific <A HREF="#CarLoad">load</A> for your cars,
you can create them using the <A HREF="#EditCarAttributes">Edit Car
Attributes</A> for car "Load". Each new load is associated with the car
type. For example you can have "Screws" for a boxcar, and "Oil" for a
tank car. The program will deliver cars with a "Schedule" load to a
siding that has a Schedule that also requests that particular load.
However, cars with a Schedule load can still be placed at yards,
staging, and interchanges.</P>

<P>You can if you wish, specify the next destination for a car
once it has been serviced by the siding. Only destination tracks that
can accept the car type are shown in the track pull down menu. </P>
<P>You can optionally use your staging tracks to empty cars with a
"Schedule" load, and you can also optionally create "Schedule" loads
using staging tracks.</P>
<P>You can also access your Schedules from the Locations Tools menu.  The
Schedules table provides status for each schedule.  Since you can assign
a schedule to multiple sidings, the table also provides additional status for each
of the sidings that use that particular schedule.  The table also allows you
the edit a schedule once its been assigned to a siding.
</P>
<H3>Local Switcher</H3>

If you want only a local switcher to service a siding, deselect all of
the direction boxes for that siding. The program will only allow a train
that has one location in its route (local switcher) to service the
siding. This would be useful if you wanted your trains to pick up and
drop cars to a yard, and then have a local switcher move them to the
town's sidings.

<H3>Why are there Yards and Sidings?</H3>

The program when generating a manifest for a train with a single
location (local switcher) will never move a car from a siding to a
siding or yard to a yard, only yard to siding or siding to yard. This
rule also applies to interchanges. This restriction helps prevent
unrealistic car movements between sidings (industries). If you want a
siding to siding local move, use a <A HREF="#Schedules">Schedule</A> to
force the car move. 

<A	NAME="Interchange"></A>
<H3>Interchange Tracks</H3>

If you want the program to force the exchange of cars between trains you
need to define an interchange track. Cars dropped off to an interchange
track by a train on a given route will not be picked up by any train
using that route. Another train with a different route is required to
pickup the cars. For example, you might have a branch line that picks up
and drops off cars from a terminal. By defining the track as an
interchange, once the branch line train delivers the cars, they will remain
there until the main line train stops to service the terminal's
interchange track.

<P>If you want more control on how your interchange track will
operate, you can optionally specify a train or route to pickup or drop
off cars at an interchange track.</P>

<H3>How to Create a Classification Yard</H3>

A classification yard is used to sort cars into various trains. Normally
a yard track is assigned to a specific train and cars are delivered to
that track until there are enough cars to complete a train. To create a
classification yard, you need to assign an <A HREF="#Interchange">interchange
track</A> to each of the trains that will depart your yard. For each
track, allow any train to drop off cars, but assign only one train to
pick them up. You should configure the interchange track to service the
same car types and roads that the train services, otherwise you could
end up with orphan cars.

<P>Note that it is okay to create more interchange tracks then there
are physical tracks in your classification yard. The cars can share the
same "slough" track until its time to finally sort them into their
various trains.</P>

<A NAME="Staging"></A>
<H3>Staging Tracks</H3>

A staging track allows you to have all cars and engines in a train
delivered to one track. When terminating a train into staging, the
program will search for a completely empty track, one with no engines or
cars. The staging track must also service all of the train's car and
engine types. Trains can not share staging tracks; the program will only
place one train per track. When departing a location with a staging
track, all cars and engines on one track will be assigned to the train.
A location can have multiple staging tracks, but can't have any other
types of tracks, sidings, yards, etc. Staging tracks can be at the start
of a route, the end of the route, or both. Staging tracks in the middle
of a route are ignored by the program.

<p>Note if you are running a train to and from the same staging
track, you must define two staging tracks for the program, one to depart
on and one to return on. Physically the two staging tracks can be the
same one. If you want to use the same name for your staging tracks, the
program allows you to name the staging tracks using a hyphen and a
number as a suffix. The hyphen and number are not printed on the switch
lists or manifests.</p>

<P>If you require a train leaving staging to have a certain number
of engines, engine model, or road name; the program will search all
staging tracks at the departure location for a train meeting those
requirements. If you set the engine requirements to 0, the program will
select the next available train from staging; and will ignore the number
of engines leaving that staging track. See <A HREF="#TrainRequires">Train
Requires</A> for more info.</P>

<H3>Looping Trains through Staging</H3>

Sometimes for operations a train enters staging at one location (call it
A) and then later departs at another location (call it B). From an
operations perspective locations A and B are locations not directly
connected by trains. So we need to relocate engines and cars from
location A to B so the train's manifest can make sense. One way to do
this is to terminate the train into staging at location A. Then create a
"virtual" train that simply moves the cars from location A staging to
location B staging. Doing this causes the program to "move" the train
and its cars from A to B which is really the same physical track. Later
you can build a train that departs location B, and the manifest will
show that the train originated from B and not A.

<p>You can automate the restaging of a train by creating a <A
	HREF="#TrainScripts">script</A> that is activated when the train is
terminated into staging.</P>

<H3>Staging and Car loads</H3>

Staging tracks can optionally swap the default car loads from empty to
loaded, and loaded to empty. Select the "Swap default Loads and Empties"
if you want your cars loads to change when arriving at the staging
track. If you're using "Scheduled" loads, you can optionally remove the
load when the cars arrive at the staging track. Select the "Empty cars
with Scheduled loads" box if you want to change your cars with
"Schedule" load to the default load empty.

<P>You can also generate "Schedule" loads on demand. Select the
"Generate scheduled loads if necessary" to create schedule loads for
your sidings that are requesting a schedule loads. The program will
create a schedule load for an empty car that is the correct type for the
siding that is demanding a load. For a load to be created, the siding
must be directly serviced by the route that departs the staging track. 
</P>
<A NAME="Cars"></A>
<H2>Cars</H2>

The cars panel allows you to edit your car roster. You can enter a car's
number, road, type, length. The program will automatically calculate the
car's weight based on length and the scale your modeling. You can
optionally add the car's color, build date, load and owner. If you want
a group of cars to be switched as a unit, you can create a "kernel". You
can assign any number of cars to a kernel but the type of the first car
assigned will be used by the program to determine if the kernel is
allowed at a location. The entire length of the kernel is used to
determine if the cars in the kernel will fit. Note that the program also
includes space for the car's couplers when calculating the length of a
kernel.

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="ImportingCars"></A>
</P>
<H3>Importing Cars from a File</H3>

If you already have a list of cars in a database, you can import the
cars into the program. The import function requires an ACSII text file,
with one line for each car. The import order is car number, car road
name, car type, car length, car weight, car color. The following shows
two examples of the correct format:

<P>336 GCR Flat 40 3.8 Black <BR>
655578 UP Boxcar 40 3.8 Yellow</P>
<P>Each line can start with a space and multiple spaces between
fields is okay. Optionally you can include additional information in the
following order, owner name, date built, and location. The location can
have two fields, the location name followed by the location's siding or
yard name separated by a hyphen. The following shows two examples of the

<P>If you prefer to use comma delimiters instead of spaces, use a file with
a .csv extension or place
the word "comma" at the start of your import file and use commas instead
of spaces. The following are two examples of importing cars with comma
deliminters.</P>
<P>comma <BR>

Terminal <BR>
655578,UP,Tank Car,40,3.8,Yellow,DB,1934,York,-,York Freight</P>
<P>You need to be very careful with spaces when importing a comma
delimitated file. The program will include leading and trailing spaces
if they exist between the commas.</P>

<P>To import a file, use the "Tools" menu in the upper left hand
corner of the Tools->Operations->Cars menu. Then select
"Tools->Roster->Import from file". Note that the program will only add
cars that don't exist in the program's car roster. It the car already
exists, the import will be skipped by the program. You must also create
the locations and their tracks before importing the cars into the
operations program.</P>

<P>To improve the speed of the car import, you can close the cars
panel. It takes significantly more processor cycles to update the cars
panel than to actually import the cars.</P> 

<P>After importing your cars, you must save them if you want to keep
them as part of your roster. Select any car by pressing the edit button
and then press the "Save" button that can be found at the bottom right
of the "Edit Car" panel. </P>

<A NAME="CarsEdit"></A>
<H3>Adding Cars to your Roster</H3>

To manually add a car to your roster, press the "Add" button located at
the bottom of the "Tools->Operations->Cars" panel. 

<P>
<img src="images/EditCar.png">
</P>
<P>

Then select the road
for the car. If the desired road doesn't exist, press the "Edit" button
across from the road select menu box. This will allow you to add a new
road or delete any that you don't need.</P>

<H3>Road Number</H3>

Now enter the car's number in the text box. The program requires a
unique road name and road number for each car. If you have cars with
identical roads and numbers, simply add a -1, -2, etc. to each of the
car numbers. The program when printing out the manifest or switch list
will drop the -1, -2, etc. from the car's road number.

<H3>Car Type, Length, Color, Weight</H3>

Select the car's type, length, and color from the menu boxes. Use the
"Edit" button to add or delete car types, lengths, or colors that you
want to add or remove. The car weight is automatically calculated, but
you can enter a different weight if necessary. When entering the length
of a car, enter the length of the body and not the total length. For
example, a forty foot boxcar has a length of 40 feet. The program when
calculating lengths will add two feet to each end of a car for the
couplers. Therefore when you place a forty foot car at a siding, it will
consume 44 feet of track.

<H3>Car subType</H3>

<P>The program supports the ability to add a subType to
your car types. Adding a "-subType" to your car type will create a new
type of car. The "-subType" is not printed on the manifest or switch
lists. For example you might have coal cars with loads and coal cars
that are empty. If you enter the car type as HopCoal-C for your cars
with coal, and HopCoal-E for the empties, the program can use this
information to assign and deliver cars to their appropriate trains and
locations respectively.</P>

<A	NAME="CabooseFredHazardous"></A>
<H3>Caboose, FRED, Hazardous Checkboxes</H3>

If the car is a caboose, has a FRED (Flashing Rear End Device), or is
hazardous, select the proper checkbox. The program uses the caboose and FRED
functions to place the car at the end of a train when the train requires
a caboose or car with FRED. The hazardous checkbox will cause the
program to add a note to the switch list that the car is transporting
hazardous materials. Your railroad's policy regarding hazardous
materials can than be applied to this car!

<H3>Car Location</H3>

Now set the car's location on the layout. If the car is off the layout,
set the location to none (blank space).

<A	NAME="CarLoad"></A>
<H3>Car Load</H3>

You can optionally set the load state of the car. Select E for empty or
L for loaded. You can also create your own car loads, but there are
restrictions. Only sidings with <A HREF="#Schedules">Schedules</A> can
load or unload cars with loads that you've created. It is also suggested
that you use a format similar to L(commodity) to describe your loads.
For example a load of tools could be entered as L(Tools).

<H3>Kernel, or Group of Cars</H3>

If wish this car to be part of a kernel which is a group of cars that
you want to switch as one unit, press "Edit" across from "Kernel" and
enter a kernel name. Then select the kernel from the menu box.

<H3>Optional Fields</H3>

Finally you can optionally enter the build date, owner and comment for
this car.  The build date can be entered as a four digit year, or in the format of
month-year.  

<H3>Save</H3>

Press "Save" to store the car's settings. The program will create a file
(OperationsCarRoster.xml) in your JMRI directory in a folder called
"operations". A backup file with the last settings for all of your cars
is also created each time the "Save" button is pressed. 

<A	NAME="EditCarAttributes"></A>
<H3>Edit Car Attributes</H3>

To the right of each of the car attributes (Road, Type, Length, Color,
Kernel, Load, Owner) is an "Edit" button. Use this to add, delete, or replace
the available attributes for a car.

<P>
<img src="images/EditCarAttribute.png">
</P>
<P></P>

<H3>Add Button</H3>

To add a new car attribute, enter the desired text in the text box and
press the "Add" button.  When you first enter a new car attribute it will
show up at the start of the list.  Later when your restart the program it
will be sorted in the correct order.

<H3>Delete Button</H3>

To delete a car attribute, select the attribute you want to delete in
the menu box and press the "Delete" button.

<H3>Replace Button</H3>

If you need to change a specific car attribute (road, type, color, etc)
in your entire car roster, you can use the "Replace" button found at the
bottom right of the edit car attribute panel. For example, if you wish
to change the car road name attribute "UP" to "UPS" for all of your
cars. Press the "Edit" button for any of your cars in the Cars panel,
and then press the "Edit" button across from Road in the "Car Edit"
panel. Enter the new road "UPS" in the text box, select "UP" in the menu
box, and press "Replace". All cars with "UP" as their road will now have
"UPS" as their road name. 

<A NAME="CarsSet"></A>
<H3>Set Car Location Button</H3>

After creating a car, you can set the car's location, and optionally the
car's destination and train. Normally the car's destination and assigned
train are generated by the program, but you can use these fields to
force a car to a specific location using a specified train. 
<P>
<img src="images/SetCarLocation.png">
</P>

<P>In the upper right hand corner of the frame is a checkbox labeled
"Location Unknown". Selecting the location unknown checkbox does several
things. First the program will ignore the car when building new trains.
Second, on manifests and switch lists, the program will list all of the
misplaced cars. Now your operators can help you find cars that have
been misplaced. And finally, when this checkbox is selected, the other fields in
the set car location window are disabled.</P>
<P>
You can also optionally enter the location and track that you want the car to
return to when the car's load status becomes empty.</P>

<H3>Tools</H3>

The cars "Tools" menu allows you to perform some useful functions to
your car roster. In addition to "Import from file" feature described
earlier, you can also export your cars to a comma separated value file.
The "Export to file" function creates a file named
"ExportOperationsCarRoster.csv" in the JMRI->operations directory. You
can remove all of the cars in your roster using the "Delete all cars"
option. You can also preview and print your car roster. The preview and
print features use the same "Sort by" radio buttons as the cars panel.
One of the more useful sorts is by "Location", this allows you to
quickly verify your car locations before or after an operations session.

<A NAME="Engines"></A>
<H2>Engines</H2>

The engines panel allows you to edit your engine roster. You can enter
an engine's number, road, model, type, and length. You can optionally
add the engine's build date and owner. If you want a group of engines to
be assigned as a unit, you can create a "consist". The engine type is
used by the program to determine where engines are picked up and or
stored at the various locations on your layout. Some of default engine
types are electric, diesel, gas turbine, and steam.

<P>
<img src="images/Engines.png">
</P>

<H3>Import Engines</H3>

If you already have a list of engines in your JMRI roster or in a
database, you can import the engines into the program. To get your
engines from your JMRI roster, select "Import from JMRI roster" from the
Tools->Operations->Engines->Tools menu. Only engines that don't exist
will be added to the programs engine roster. This way you can use this
tool any time you add engines to your JMRI engine roster. The JMRI engine
roster doesn't have the length field, so a default length is entered for
you. You should correct the engine length if you want the program to
correctly calculate your train lengths.

<H3>Import Engines from a File</H3>

The import from file function requires an ACSII text file, with one line
for each engine. The import order is engine number, engine road name,
engine model, and engine length. The following shows two examples of the
correct format:

<P>236 UP RS4 40 <BR>
5578 SP SW1200 42</P>
<P>Each line can start with a space and multiple spaces between
fields is okay. Optionally you can include additional information in the
following order, owner name, date built, and location. The location can
have two fields, the location name followed by the location's siding or
yard name separated by a hyphen. The following shows two examples of the
correct format:</P>

<BR>
236 UP RS4 40 AT 1930 Home Town USA - Engine Terminal <BR>
5578 SP SW1200 42 DB 1934 York - York Engine Yard

<P>If you prefer to use comma delimiters instead of spaces, use a file with
a .csv extension or place
the word "comma" at the start of your import file and use commas instead
of spaces. The following are two examples of importing engines with
comma deliminters.</P>
<P>comma <BR>
236,UP,RS 4,40,AT,1930,Home Town USA,-,Engine Terminal <BR>
5578,SP,SW 1200,42,DB,1934,Town of York,-,York Engine Yard</P>
<P>You need to be very careful with spaces when importing a comma
delimitated file. The program will include leading and trailing spaces
if they exist between the commas.</P>
<P>To import a file, use the "Tools" menu in the upper left hand
corner of the Tools->Operations->Engines menu. Select
"Tools->Roster->Import. Note that the program will only add engines that
don't exist in the program's engine roster. It the engine already
exists, it will be skipped by the program.</P>

<P>After importing your engines, you must save them if you want to
keep them as part of your roster. Select any engine by pressing the edit
button and then press the "Save" button that can be found at the bottom
right of the "Edit Engine" panel.</P>

<A NAME="EnginesAdd"></A>
<H3>Adding Engines to your Roster</H3>

To manually add an engine to your roster, press the "Add" button located
at the bottom of the "Engines" panel. Then select the road for the
engine. If the desired road doesn't exist, press the "Edit" button
across from the road select menu box. This will allow you to add a new
road or delete any that you don't need. Now enter the engine's number,
model, type, length and horsepower. The engine's horsepower, the train's
weight, and track grade is used by the program to calculate how many
engines are required when using the "Auto" feature when building trains.

<p>Now set the engine's location on the layout. If the engine is off
the layout, set the location to none (blank space). If wish this engine
to be part of a consist, press "Edit" across from "Consist" and enter a
consist name. Then select the consist name from the menu box. Finally
you can optionally enter the build date, owner and comment for this
engine.</P>

<H3>Engine Models</H3>

The program allows you organize your engines by model. Each model can
only have one engine type, length, weight and horsepower rating
associated with it. For example, if you assign the model name "RS11" to
a set of engines, when you change the length of one of the "RS11"s, the
length will also change for the others.

<H3>Save</H3>

Press "Save" to store the engine's settings. The program will create a
file (OperationsEngineRoster.xml) in your JMRI directory in a folder
called "operations". A backup file with the last settings for all of
your engines is also created each time the "Save" button is pressed. 

<A	NAME="EnginesSet"></A>
<H3>Engine Set Location Button</H3>

After creating an engine, you can set the engine's location, and
optionally the engine's destination and train. Normally the engine's
destination and assigned train are generated by the program, but you can
use these fields to force an engine to a specific location using a
specified train.

<H3>Synchronize with NCE Consists</H3>

If you are using NCE as your DCC command station, you can have the
program synchronize your consist numbers with your engines. The program
will read all of the consists out of the NCE system and then will search
for matching engines in your operations roster. The program will assign
the consist name nce_xxx where xxx is the consist number. To synchronize
your consists, select "Synchronize with NCE Consists" under the "Tools"
menu. 

<A NAME="Routes"></A>
<H2>Routes</H2>

A route is a list of locations that a train will visit. Later you can
decide if the train stops at a location for work. Routes can be point to
point or out and back. To build a route, select
"Tools->Operations->Routes".

<P><img src="images/Routes.png"></P>

<P>Then press the "Add" button located at the bottom of the page.</P>

<P><img src="images/EditRoute.png"></P>

<P>Enter the route name. Each route must have unique name. Then
press the "Add Route" button located at the bottom of the panel. Now
select the location the train will depart by selecting the location in
the menu box located at the left bottom side of the panel. Press "Add
Location". Now build your route by selecting the next location the train
will visit, select all locations that the train will pass through even
if the train will not work the location. This way your train's engineer
will know when reading his manifest the towns he will be traveling
through. Each time you add a location to the route, the table shows the
order in which the train will visit. You can move a location up or down
in the sequence if needed.</P>

<H3>Route Train Direction, Moves, Drops, Pickups, Train Length,
Grade, X and Y</H3>

Each location has the train's departure direction, number of desired car
moves, and whether car pickups and or car drops are allowed at that
location. You can also adjust the maximum train length that can depart
that location. A car move can be a car pickup or car drop at that
location. For example, 5 moves can be 5 pickups or 5 drops or any
combination of 5 pickups or drops.

<P>The grade is used to determine how many engines the train will
require for that segment. The X and Y are the coordinates on your
dispatcher's panel for the optional train icon. You can set the
coordinates here, or use the "SetX&Y" train icon popup menu to teach the
program where you want the train icon placed when the train is at the
specified location. Leave the X and Y coordinates at zero if you want to
manually move the icon or you're not using the icon feature. After
setting the number of moves, maximum length, or coordinates, click on
the table to make sure it is recognized by the program, then hit "Save
Route."</P>

<H3>Save Route</H3>

Press "Save Route" to save your route. The program will create a file
(OperationsRouteRoster.xml) in your JMRI directory in a folder called
"operations". A backup file with the last settings for all of your
routes is also created each time the "Save Route" button is pressed. 

<A NAME="CopyRoute"></A>
<H3>Copy Route</H3>

In the Route panel select "Tools->Copy Route" to make a copy of your
route. Enter the name of the new route and select the route that you
want to copy. If you want the route reversed check the "Invert" box. 

<A NAME="Trains"></A>
<H2>Trains</H2>

Now that we've created our routes we need trains to move cars! Create a
train by selecting "Tools->Operations->Trains" from the top level menu.

<P>
Enter the train's name and
optional description, and then press the "Add Train" button. Both will
show up on the train's manifest. The train's name will also show up on
the train icon, so short names work best. Then select the route that
this train will travel. There's an Edit button to the right of the route
that allows you to directly edit the selected route. Once a route is
selected a list of locations that the train will visit should appear.
You can deselect any location that you don't want the train to work.</P>

<H3>Train Departure Time</H3>

Enter the time that this train will depart the first location in its
route. You can use the departure time to sort your trains in the order
that you want them built when using the <A HREF="#BuildingTrains">Build
Selected Trains</A> button.

<H3>Train Rolling Stock</H3>

You can determine what type of cars and engines the train will service.
Select the rolling stock the train will carry by clicking on the
appropriate checkboxes. A checked box means the train will service this
type of rolling stock.

<A NAME="TrainRequires"></A>
<H3>Train Requires</H3>

You can control the number of engines that will be assigned to this
train, and optionally, the engine's model and road name. If you want two
or more engines assigned to a train, the engines must be part of a
consist. If you select "Auto", the program will calculate the number of
engines required for this train based on the weight of the train, the
track grade, and the horsepower of the engines.

<P>You can also require a <A HREF="#CabooseFredHazardous">caboose
or car with FRED (Flashing Rear End Device)</A> as the last car in the
train, and you can optionally specify the road name for the caboose or
car with FRED. If you leave the road name blank, the program will try
and find a caboose with the same road name as the engine.</P>

<H3>Reset Train</H3>

The "Reset Train" button allows you to remove engines and cars that have
been assigned to a train. Useful when you want to try various build
options and don't what to physically move engines and cars on the
railroad.

<H3>Save Train</H3>

Press "Save Train" to save your train. The program will create a file
(OperationsTrainRoster.xml) in your JMRI directory in a folder called
"operations". A backup file with the last settings for all of your
trains is also created each time the "Save Train" button is pressed. 

<A NAME="TrainOptions"></A>
<H3>Train Options</H3>

<A NAME="BuildingTrains"></A>
<H2>Building Trains</H2>

To build one train, press the "Build" button in the row for the desired
train in the "Trains" panel. The button will become "Print" or "Preview"
after the train is built. If you want to review how the train was built,
select the "Build Reports" before pressing the "Print" or "Preview"
button for the desired train. If the "Preview Manifest" checkbox is
selected, the program will generate the build report and manifest and
present them in preview windows. If you want to build several trains
without having to press individual buttons for each train, select the
trains that you want built and press the "Build" button found at the
bottom of the trains panel. The program will then build manifests for
all of the selected trains.

<P>If a train fails to build, the "Move" button will change its text
to "Report". Pressing "Report" will print or preview the build report
for this train. Whenever a train fails to build, a build failure message
will appear. If you want to disable this feature deselect the checkbox
"Build Messages".</P>

<A	NAME="TroubleShootingBuildingTrains"></A>
<H2>Problems Building Trains</H2>

If you have a problem building a train you can select the "Build
Reports" checkbox at the bottom of the train panel. When a build fails
for any reason and the "Build Reports" checkbox is selected, the program
will send a report to your printer if the "Preview Manifests" isn't
selected; or to a preview window if the "Preview Manifest" is selected.
The build report can print out different levels of detail, from minimal
to very detailed. See the Settings section <A HREF="#BuildReportDetails">Build
Report Details</A> for more information on how to change the build report
detail level.

<P>
<img src="images/BuildReport.png">
</P>
<H3>Reading the Build Report</H3>

The build report shows the steps the operations program goes through
while building a train. The first page provides the route the train will
travel and the number of car moves requested for each location. The
report then shows the car type and engine types that the train will
service. By reading the various comments in the report you can get an
idea of steps the operations program goes through to build a train. When
there's an issue that the operation's build can't resolve, the build
will fail. To understand why a build failed, go to the last page of the
build report and by working backwards from the last line, you should be
able to understand why a train failed to build.

<H3>More Build Report Details</H3>

For those who want to understand how the program builds trains here's
the details. If the train requires an engine or several engines, the
program will look for engines at the start of the route and then
determines if the termination location will accept them. Note that if
two or more engines are required for the train that the engines must be
in a consist. The program assigns to the engines and cars the number of
moves that they experience during each session. The move count is bumped
up each time an engine or car is dropped off to a new location's track.
The program sorts the engines and cars by the move count, and then tries
to assign engines and cars with the least number of moves to the train.
When building a train only cars at locations that are part of the train's route
are used.
<P>The next step is to assign a caboose or car with FRED to the
train. If the program finds the required caboose or car with FRED at the
start of the route, the program tries to find a track at the termination
location that will accept it. If successful, all other cabooses and cars
with FRED are removed from the available car list.</P>
<P>Next the program will assign cars to the train starting from the
departure location. Each car goes through the process of finding a track
along the route that will accept the car. Another count assigned to a
track is used to determine if the track has been serviced recently.
Tracks with the least amount of service get priority. A car can have
several track choices and the one with the highest priority will be
assigned as the car's destination. The process continues until the
number of car moves requested by a location is met, or the available
cars being processed by the program is used up. Once the car moves
requested for a location is met, the next location in the route is
processed. This continues until all locations in a train's route have
been processed.</P>




<H3>Printing Manifests</H3>

After building a train, the "Build" button will become "Print" or
"Preview" depending on the state of the checkbox called "Preview
Manifests" located in the lower right corner of the Trains window.
Pressing the "Print" button will print the manifest for that train.
Pressing the "Preview" button will produce a window in which you can
review the manifest. If you want to print manifests for several trains,
select the trains you want in the build column and then press the
"Print" or "Preview" button found at the bottom of the trains panel. The
program will then print or preview manifests for all of the selected
trains.

<A NAME="SwitchList"></A>
<H3>Switch Lists</H3>

A switch list shows the work required to service all of the trains
visiting that location. Normally a switch list is given to the person in
charge of a yard or a location with many sidings or industries.

<P>Press the "Print Switch List" button if you want a switch list
for a given location. A menu will appear that allows you to select which
locations to preview or print. Once you've determined which locations
you want to print or preview, press the "Save" button to keep your
selections.</P>

<H3>Moving Trains</H3>

After providing your operators with a printed manifest or location
switch list, you must keep the program database synchronized with the
actual movement of trains on your layout. This is done by the "Move"
button located on the far right of the train menu. Pressing the "Move"
button will cause the train to depart its current location move to the
next location in the route. The engines and cars assigned to the train
will travel to the next location on the railroad. At each location, cars
can be picked up or dropped off. You can also move a train by selecting
the train's icon and selecting "Move" from the icon's popup menu. Each
press of the "Move" button moves the train closer to its terminal
location. When the train arrives at the last location in the route, the
last press of the "Move" button will terminate the train. Once a train
is terminated, you can build it again.

<P>Each time an engine or car is moved a count associated with them
is incremented. The program uses this to determine which cars haven't
moved recently and tries to select cars with the least number of moves
when building new trains. Each time a location has a car picked up or
dropped, the program increments a count associated with that location.
The program tries to move cars to locations that have experienced the
least number of car operations.</P>

<H3>Terminate Trains</H3>

When you terminate a train, you are asking the program to move the train
from its current location to its final destination. The cars and engines
associated with the train will be picked up and delivered to the
locations shown in the train manifest. To terminate several trains,
select the trains you wish to terminate in the build column and press
the "Terminate" button at the bottom of the train panel.

<H3>Save Builds</H3>

Pressing the "Save Builds" button causes the program to update the
train, car, engine, and location xml files. Any time you "Move" a train
the operations program will make changes to the train, car, engine, and
location databases. These databases must be saved before you shut down
JMRI, otherwise you will lose all of the changes that the operations
program made to move a train to the next location. Pressing the "Save
Builds" button before quitting JMRI allows the operations program to
resume exactly at the point where you pressed the "Save Builds" button.

<H2>Building Multiple Trains for a Session</H2>

Most operating sessions require more than one train to keep your
operators busy. The correct way to do this is to build and print all of
the trains needed before terminating them. So if you need a dozen trains
for a session, you must build twelve trains before you terminate any one
train. Terminating a train tells the program that the engines and cars
in that particular train have been delivered to their final locations
and can be used again when building new trains. So always build all,
print all, THEN terminate each train after completing its run! It is
okay to build all trains, print all train, and then use the "Save
Builds" button and shut down the program. Later you can restart the
program and terminate the trains that completed their runs.

<p>The correct time to terminate a train is when the train actually
arrives at its destination. Terminating a train before it completes it
run means that the operation database believes that the engines and cars
have been delivered. It is better to build and print twelve trains and
then later find out that only nine trains completed their runs. You
would then terminate nine trains, and leave the other three for next
time. Or if you wish you could reset any trains that didn't depart from
their terminal. Reseting trains really isn't necessary, the trains that
didn't run during this session could run the during the next session.
</P>
<p>An alternate method is to build, print, and use the "Move" button
for each train to track the actual movement of the trains during your
session. As long as the trains on your layout match the locations in the
program you can build a new train.</P>

<H2>Operation Windows</H2>

Some of the operation panels can be resized and placed to your liking.
Pressing the save button will store the size and location for the
following operation panels:

<ul>
<li>Settings</li>
<li>Edit Location</li>
<li>Edit Car</li>
<li>Edit Engine</li>
<li>Trains</li>
<li>Edit Train</li>
</ul>

<P>The program also allows you to resize the Trains panel table
column widths. Adjust the column widths to your liking and then press
"Save Builds" to save your preferences.</P>

<P>The end of operations help.</P>
