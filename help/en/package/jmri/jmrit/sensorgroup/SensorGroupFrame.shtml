      <h1>Sensor Groups</h1>The Sensor Group tool window allows you
      to define Sensor Groups, a group of sensors of which at most
      one can be active. When a member of the group becomes active,
      all others are set to inactive.

      <p>Generally, you would use something like this to simulate a
      rotary switch on a real control panel. The real switch would
      activate only one input as it was turned from position to
      position; the previous input would become inactive as the
      switch turned to the next position. On a PanelPro control
      panel, each position might be shown by a separate sensor icon
      which you click to activate. Putting that set of sensors in a
      Sensor Group would then cause the sensor at the previous
      position to go inactive when you clicked to change the
      simulated rotary switch.</p>

      <p>To define a group:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Check the "Included" box next to each sensor that you
        want to include in the group. You can click on the titles
        at the top of the columns to sort them if you have lots of
        sensors to flip through.</li>

        <li>Put a unique sensor group name in the box at the
        bottom. No particular format is required, but it can't
        duplicate one you've already defined.</li>

        <li>Click add/update</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To see a Sensor Group you've already defined, put it's
      name in the Group Name box, and click View. You can then
      change the checkboxes to add or remove sensors from the
      group, and click Add/Update to make your changes.</p>

      <p>Remember to save your changes to a new configuration or
      panel file before quitting the program!</p>
