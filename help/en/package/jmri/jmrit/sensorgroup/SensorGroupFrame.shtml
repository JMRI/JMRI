      <h1>Sensor Groups</h1>

      <p>The Sensor Group Tool window allows you to define Sensor Groups, a group of sensors of
      which at most one can be active. When a member of the group becomes active, all others are
      set to inactive.</p>

      <p>The Sensor Group Tool can be accessed via PanelPro &gt; Tools &gt; Sensor Groups.</p>

      <p>Generally, you would use something like this to simulate a rotary switch on a real control
      panel. The real switch would activate only one input as it was turned from position to
      position; the previous input would become inactive as the switch turned to the next
      position.</p>

      <p>On a PanelPro control panel, each position might be shown by a separate sensor icon which
      you click to activate. Putting that set of sensors in a Sensor Group would then cause the
      sensor at the previous position to go inactive when you clicked to change the simulated
      rotary switch.</p>

      <p>To define a group:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Check the "Included" box next to each sensor that you want to include in the group. You
        can click on the titles at the top of the columns to sort them if you have lots of sensors
        to flip through.</li>

        <li>Put a unique sensor group name in the box at the bottom. No particular format is
        required, but it can't duplicate one you've already defined.</li>

        <li>Click add/update</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To see a Sensor Group you've already defined, put it's name in the Group Name box, and
      click View. You can then change the checkboxes to add or remove sensors from the group, and
      click Add/Update to make your changes.</p>

      <p>Remember to save your changes to a new configuration or panel file before quitting the
      program!</p>
