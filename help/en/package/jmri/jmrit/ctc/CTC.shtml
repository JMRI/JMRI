      <h1>JMRI: CTC</h1>

      <p>
      CTC is a very complex system. An understanding of the goals of CTC and
      how it functions is very helpful.  While this tool will describe various
      CTC features, it is not a CTC course.  There are many books written on
      the subject, for example Dr. Bruce Chubb's CTC manuals.  Other materials
      (too numerous to list) exist on the Internet as well, such as Mike
      Burgett's web site (since shut down, but may be active in the future again)
      and Michael J. Burgett's <a href="http://www.ctcparts.com/about.htm">The
      Engineering Basics of CTC</a>.<br>
      As a starter, check our <a href="#ctcDefinitions">CTC Definitions</a> at
      the bottom of this page.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Important</strong>: A requirement of CTC is that a fully functional
      ABS (Automatic Block Signaling) signaling system  already is in place on your
      layout. As you may already know, CTC is just a layer on top of ABS.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
      The CTC system consists of three main components.  The first one is the
      <strong>CTC Editor</strong> which is used to define the CTC system.  The
      second component is <strong>CTCMain</strong>, which is a run time
      component which executes the rules created by the editor.  These
      components are started by using the PanelPro <strong>Tools</strong> menu
      and/or including them as actions defined in <strong>Preferences >> Start
      Up</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
      The last component is the layout configuration in JMRI. This includes
      turnout definitions, occupancy sensors, blocks and signals.  The signals
      can be defined as signal heads with SSL or signal masts using signal mast
      logic. The signaling implementation needs to properly implement ABS
      signaling before adding CTC. This includes proper block boundaries.
      </p>

      <h3>CTC Editor</h3>
      <p>
      To start the CTC Editor, on the main PanelPro screen select the Tools &gt; CTC menu item
      and select "CTC Configuration Editor".
      </p>
      <p>
      The CTC Editor is used to define the CTC components and the rules that will
      be used by the run time component.  The resulting data is stored in an XML
      file:  <strong>CTCSystem.xml</strong>.  This file is located at the
      <em>user files location</em> in the <strong>ctc</strong> directory.
      </p>

      <p>
      As an option to support creation of the GUI portion of the CTC machine,
      an external Panel Editor panel file can be created by pressing a single button. This
      facilitates the design of the full GUI CTC panel.  This feature also
      creates a 2nd minimal panel xml file that contains all of the CTC specific
      internal sensors.
      </p>

      <h3>CTCMain</h3>
      <p>
      CTCMain is the run time component that provides all of the logic to
      implement a CTC machine.  It responds to layout and panel inputs and
      takes appropriate actions based on the definitions provided by the
      CTC Editor.  It eliminates the need to create Logix or scripts.
      </p>

    <h2>CTC Editor</h2>

    <p>
    The CTC Editor consists of a menu bar, a section containing a list of the
    defined OS sections with related buttons and a group of 9 buttons at the
    bottom.  With the exception of the <strong>Code</strong> button, the
    remaining buttons can be enabled to activate the selected CTC feature.
    </p>

    <p>
    When the editor is started, it loads the current CTCSystem.xml file.  When
    the editor is stopped by using the window close button, the CTCSystem.xml
    file is updated.  See the <a href="#menuFile">file menu</a> for other options.
    </p>

      <h3>Editor Menus</h3>

      <a name="menuFile" id="menuFile"></a>
      <h4>File menu</h4>
      <p>
      The <strong>New</strong> menu item deletes the current configuration in
      the editor.  If the editor is then closed (which does an automatic save),
      the CTCSystem.xml file will be empty.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <strong>Save</strong> menu item writes the current editor configuration
      to the CTCSystem.xml
      file.  The CTC Editor program is not closed.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <strong>Exit without saving</strong> menu item after asking for confirmation
      that you really want to do this, discards any changes and closes the CTC Editor.
      </p>

      <a name="menuEditFind" id="menuEditFind"></a>
      <h4>Edit menu</h4>
        <h5>Find and Replace...</h5>
        <p>
        This invokes a powerful editor.  It doesn't have many features, but the
        important point is that it will search everything in the system for
        references to things that may be changing.  For example, when changing
        "IS8:LDGL" -> "IS8:XYZZY", the program will list all of these references,
        and - if approved - will change all of them, so that there are no
        "dangling references" to something that no longer exists.  In this
        manner, it is a "refactor / replace" function (for programmers who
        understand these terms).
        </p>

        <p>
        Only data "destined" for JMRI is scanned.  None of the data maintained
        by this program for its own internal use (such as Patterns, Defaults,
        etc.), is scanned.
        </p>

          <h6>Searching</h6>
          <p>
          Enter in the text to search for, along with "Case sensitive" checkbox
          and Exact / Contains radio buttons.
          </p>
          <p>
          Once the <strong>Find</strong> button is pressed, the results are
          shown on the right.  This shows where the search string was found in
          the system, and the context it is used in.  No items are selected.
          Press <strong>Select all</strong> to select all rows.  That button
          now says <strong>Deselect all</strong> (it flip/flops from one to the
          other). The standard single selection, multiple selection and range
          selection options are available. A count of the items selected appears
          next to the <strong>Replace</strong> button.  Only the selected items
          will be replaced.
          </p>

          <h6>Replacing</h6>
          <p>
          At least one item has to be selected before the <strong>Replace</strong>
          button will be enabled.  The radio buttons above it allows the replace
          process to be modified.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Replace completely</strong>:  The entire line no matter where
          the search string is found is replaced by the "<strong>Replace with:
          </strong>" text.  This is not a common choice.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Replace searched for value only</strong>:  This is the
          typical choice and the default.  The search text is replaced with the
          replacement text.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Rescan with below and substitute with above</strong>:  The
          purpose of this is to use the first search function to locate lines
          with other data in them, then re-scan each of the lines selected with
          the new search pattern, and substitute the "Replace with:" value there.
          This sub-search is case sensitive.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the nature of the change,
          it is possible that new sensors are required.  For example, changing
          IS2:CB to IS2:CodeBtn results in a new Code Button sensor.  If the
          panel xml file already refers to the old sensor name, it will have to
          be modified.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Warning: At present, there is no "Undo".</em></strong></p>

        <a name="menuEditFix" id="menuEditFix"></a>
        <h5>Fix Error(s)...</h5>
        <p>If an attempt is made to save the editor data and the
        <strong>***ERROR***</strong> indicator appears anywhere in the Columns
        listing, the save, including the automatic save during program exit,
        will not occur.  A dialog will suggest doing this menu item.  Please
        read carefully the information in this menu item.</p>

      <a name="menuCfgDeb" id="menuCfgDeb"></a>
      <h4>Configure menu</h4>
        <h5>Debugging</h5>
        <p>The defaults here are good enough, but may be modified if desired.</p>

        <p>
        <strong>CTC system reload sensor</strong>: This sensor, when triggered
        (set to active) will cause the entire CTC system to reload.  This makes
        it possible to make CTC Editor changes and then test them immediately
        without having to restart JMRI each time. See "Running the CTC system
        under JMRI" for more information on this.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>CTC debug traffic locking rules triggered display sensor</strong>:
        When active, the number of the Traffic Locking rule that was true is
        logged when a Code Button is pressed.  It is logged as an INFO message
        to the System Console.  In order to see the System Console within JMRI
        select Help &gt; System Console...  It's the "Green Screen".
        </p>

        <a name="menuCfgDef" id="menuCfgDef"></a>
        <h5>Defaults</h5>
        <p><strong>Signal System Type</strong>: Select either Signal Heads or Signal Masts.</p>

        <p><strong>Turnout locks enabled at startup</strong> and <strong>Seconds
        until all lockable turnouts locked</strong>:  The default is
        checked and the CTC system will lock all of the turnouts automatically
        at startup.  Some layouts require locks to be unlocked at CTC system
        startup for other external (to CTC) initialization requirements.  You can then
        have your dispatcher manually lock all of the locked turnouts before
        the layout starts operation.  Or, you can set the "Seconds until all lockable
        turnouts locked" to a value >0 (in seconds), and the CTC system will do
        this automatically after that time period.  <strong>Note</strong>: each time JMRI
        is started, it takes a variable amount of time to complete, so this value
        may have to be set a bit higher than the quickest time, in order to give
        the system a chance to stabilize before locking the turnouts.
        Or you can invoke the following lines
        (however you want) in a Jython script file in order to have this done
        automatically by your script(s) after your special external
        initialization requirements are done:</p>

        <div style="margin-left: 2em;"><pre>
        import jmri
        ctcMain = jmri.InstanceManager.getNullableDefault(jmri.jmrit.ctc.CTCMain)
        if ctcMain is not None: ctcMain.externalLockTurnout()
        </pre></div>

        <p><strong>Time values</strong> (for Signal and Switch
        directions): These are values that are given to
        each CTC O.S. Section as default values when the CTC O.S. Section is
        created. The timing values edit boxes are standard CTC values, refer to
        Definitions for more information on each.</p>

        <p><strong>No Code Button delay in milliseconds</strong>:  This is the
        default for newly created O.S. Sections. Individual O.S. (for "On Sheet")
        Sections can be changed if needed.  Background: Normal CTC panels always had a code
        button for every O.S. Section which means a value of zero is appropriate.
        Certain tower situations did not have a Code Button(s) present when some
        or all of the O.S. Section(s) were local to the tower.  In this case,
        the tower operator changing either the switch direction and/or signal
        direction levers was enough to transmit the request to the field.  On
        the prototype, there was a built in delay so that the tower operator
        could change both the switch and signal levers before the code was
        transmitted to the local O.S. Section. That delay is simulated with
        this value.  Having a larger value will increase  this delay, and a
        large enough value will allow the tower operator to change both the
        switch and signal lever before the codes are transmitted to the field.
        A reasonable value in this case might be 5000 (5 seconds).  Some towers
        had virtually no delay, so enter a value such as 10 milliseconds.</p>

        <a name="menuCfgFlt" id="menuCfgFlt"></a>
        <h5>Fleeting</h5>
        <p><strong>Fleeting toggle sensor</strong>: The sensor used to
        enable/disable fleeting.</p>

        <p><strong>Fleeting enabled at start</strong>: Default is to not enable
        fleeting during startup.</p>

        <a name="menuCfgPat" id="menuCfgPat"></a>
        <h5>Patterns</h5>
        <p>
        Since there will probably be 100's if not 1,000's of JMRI internal
        sensor objects (Prefix "IS:") that need to be created to support all
        of the on-screen objects of a typical CTC installation, it is important
        that you realize how this program works with these "patterns"".  By
        using them, you do not have to spend dozens of hours to enter all of
        this in manually, or make a mistake and have
        the JMRI runtime system complain of problem(s) - back and forth, make a
        change, run JMRI, find another problem, etc.  Using patterns prevents
        this.
        </p>

        <p>
        Patterns are used for all of the internal sensors created by this
        system.  When an O.S. Section is created, there are two numbers that
        are associated with that O.S. Section: a switch number (always odd)
        and the corresponding signal number (always even and always one more
        than the switch number).
        </p>

        <p>
        The pattern format is IS#:XXX. The "#" character in the edit boxes are
        substituted automatically when the CTC O.S. Section is first created.
        The respective switch / signal areas use the respective switch # /
        signal # given for the O.S. Section.  If more than one "#" appears, every "#"
        will get the corresponding substituted number.
        In this way you do not have to do all of the manual typing or selecting
        associated with creating all of these sensor strings.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Patterns usage by this program and its advantages over other methods</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
        Every time an O.S. Section is created, the program will apply a set
        of patterns provided by the user: a default set of patterns is
        automatically generated by the program at startup which the user can
        override at will.  This will be explained in more detail later.
        In order to see these default patterns, start the program and choose
        the "Configure &gt; Patterns" menu.
        </p>
        <p>
        Changing anything on this screen has no effect on existing information
        in the system.  It is only used when a <strong>new</strong> O.S. Section is
        created (via the Add... button).<br>
        However, you may selectively re-apply this pattern to the
        whole system or individual pieces of the system.  Here's how:
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Reapplying patterns to existing information:</strong><br>
        Once you've changed this screen, you may want the new pattern to be selectively applied.
        There are two choices:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Reapply pattern to selected item (a single O.S. Section) or</li>
        <li>Reapply pattern to selected item (a single O.S. Section) specific sub-system.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To do 1, get to the main screen, and select a single O.S. Section.  The "Reapply patterns to selected item"
        button will be enabled.  When you press this button, a confirmation dialog will appear.  Pressing "Yes" will
        then take the new pattern specified and completely apply it to all of the O.S. Sections sub-systems.
        To do 2, get to the main screen, and select a single O.S. Section.  Then at the bottom of the screen, press
        the "Edit" button for the sub-system you want to modify.  NOTE: Some sub-systems are not affected by this,
        so what follows may not appear.  You will then see a button at the bottom of the sub-system selected, called
        "Reapply patterns - this form ONLY!". Pressing it will immediately show you the results of the new
        pattern in the edit boxes of that screen.
        </p>

        <h5>GUI Design</h5>
<p>
<strong>GUI Design - automatic creation of the JMRI GUI screen</strong>:
An additional feature of this program is to be able to automatically create a "standard" USS CTC panel
from the parameters specified elsewhere in this program.  This screen configures the available options.
See <a href="#ctcFiles">"Files created for support..."</a> for more information and procedures for loading
them into the JMRI system.
Everything is put in pre-determined locations on the screen.  It is an easy procedure in JMRI's Panel Editor
(or other) to reposition those items.
<strong>Caveat:</strong>
If you do change the locations of items on a panel, JMRI does not modify the files created by this program.
It is not designed to keep track of which file contains which modifications.  Only if you save the panel to a
completely different panel name will those changes be saved.  You should completely design the CTC panel using
this program before saving to another name in JMRI, and then begin the final changes to that panel from within JMRI.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Extra blank columns after last defined column to create:</strong>
Normally, if this is 0, this program creates after the last CTC O.S. Section column specified a "right
edge of CTC machine panel".  If you want additional blank column(s) between your last CTC O.S. Sections
column # and the right edge, enter that number here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Type of CTC panel</strong>:
Presently only USS is available at this time (10/31/2018).  More may be available in the future.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Vertical size:</strong>
JMRI provides blank panel items in each of the sizes listed.  Choose one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Signals on panel</strong>
All O.S. Section signals - All of the signals specified in the Signal Direction Indicators sub-system are
created on the screen for you.  This is not a prototype practice, but will help in your development of
SSL (Simple Signal Logic) and CTC design.  You can see the state of the signals in the field with this.  Signal
heads or Signal masts will be created per your specification.
Green/off only (Future feature) - Not available at this time.  The prototype in certain installations have
a single green indicator indicating all signal(s) at that location are displaying stop (red) (green indicator
off) or permissive of some form (one or more signals at that location non-stop (non-red)).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Builder Plate</strong>
Check this if you want the builder plate on the machine face.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Turnouts on panel</strong>
Normally you want to generate turnouts on the CTC track board, which is the default "Generate checked".  If
you don"t want this feature, uncheck this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fleeting toggle switch (only if fleeting configured)</strong>
Create the toggle switch on the panel if checked.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Analog clock and clock on toggle</strong>
Create an analog clock on the panel, along with above it a toggle switch to turn it on / off.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reload CTC system button</strong>
Create a button on the screen to perform this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CTC Debug on toggle</strong>
Ditto.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Create variety of track pieces</strong> (future feature):
A variety of track pieces are created on the screen, so that it is easier to "copy / paste" all of these objects as the designer desires.
</p>
<p>
<strong>O.S. Occupancy sensor blinks red when unknown or inconsistent</strong>
Normally, JMRI will display an "X" or "?" on a sensor when its state is unknown or inconsistent.  By checking
this checkbox, the program will substitute a blinking indicator for these to draw better attention to them.
I personally use these for optical sensors on my layout because of the number of sensors on my layout causes
LocoNet to loose messages at system startup.

      <h3>OS Section List</h3>

<h4>The Prototype CTC machine and this program</h4>
A prototype CTC machine is organized by columns (my term).  A single CTC machine column can be blank, or contain an O.S.
section and all of the associated controls.  I begin the numbering of my CTC machine columns with 1.  This column number
has no relation or correlation at all to the Switch or Signal numbers of a normal O.S. Section.  You can create as many columns
as you like on the computer screen(s).
<h4>OS Sections</h4>
A non-blank column always has an O.S. Section with a Code Button associated with it.  An O.S. Section always has an odd
switch number and an even signal number, where the signal number is always one more than the switch number.
Each O.S. Section as it is created does not have to be 2 more than the prior switch number entry.  Example: 1, 3, 7, 15, 17....
They do not have to be in ascending sequence, their order has no impact on the program.  However, it is strongly suggested per
prototype practice that they are in ascending sequence.  You may re-order them on the main screen using up/down buttons in case
you entered them out of order, which is described in another section.

<h4>"JMRI Validation" and "Check everything with JMRI" (grayed out at start)</h4>
<p>
<strong>Prerequisite</strong>: A new system displays "JMRI Validation: Disabled", and also
the button "Check everything with JMRI" is grayed out (disabled).  This is normal for a new system.
</p>
<p>
Once both of the sensors defined in Configure/Debugging are contained in the panel file
and that panel file is loaded, then "JMRI Validation: Enabled" will be displayed and the
button "Check everything with JMRI" is available for pressing.
</p>
<h5>The purpose of pressing "Check everything with JMRI":</h5>
<p>
Pressing this will then present you with a dialog asking if you want to see all of the errors listed on a separate
screen.  It will then go thru <strong>every</strong> JMRI object that is backed by a real device (sensor, signals, etc) defined
in the CTC system and verify that a definition exists for it within JMRI already.
This is just a sanity check, and normally you should not encounter any errors.  If you
do, then define the missing object(s) in JMRI.
</p>
      <h3>Action buttons</h3>
      <p>
      These are located to the right of the "Presently defined CTC O.S. Sections:" list.<br>
      The "Add..." button is always available.<br>
      Other buttons are dynamically enabled or disabled based upon the selected item.
      </p>
        <h4>Add...</h4>
        <p>
        Allows you to add another column.
        </p>
        <p>
        After pressing, configure the two values as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Regarding the check box "GUI Generated before":</strong>
        If checked, then this column has already been generated once before.  In case you want it to be generated
        again when you press "Write .xml files for JMRI GUI support", clear the check box.
        </p>
        <h4>Delete</h4>
        <p>
        Allows you to delete a column <strong>if</strong> there are no references to it.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you notice in the column that you are deleting that there are items in parenthesis's, you will be prevented
        from deleting that column with an error message.  Only when the parenthesis's disappear will you be allowed
        to delete the column.
        </p>
        <p>
        The general format is #/# indicating which switch and signal column entry is referencing this entry,
        followed by the following letter possibilities:
        "TrL:" Traffic Locking rule references this.  If there is an 'L' appended, it indicates left traffic rules, otherwise right traffic rules.
          "Sw:" Switch Slaved references this.</p>

      <h3>Edit Buttons</h3>
      <p>At the bottom of the screen are buttons to configure the selected entry in the list:</p>
        <a name="frmCB" id="frmCB"></a>
        <h4>Code Button</h4>
        <p>
        This provides the major information for a single O.S. Section. It is enabled as soon as an item is selected in
        the list.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Code Button sensor</strong>: Required.  Enter the sensor associated with this Code Button.  This name
        is automatically generated by the patterns system.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Primary O.S. Section occupied sensor</strong>: Required.  So long as this sensor is active (indicating
        that the O.S. Section is occupied), then the following cannot be changed: signals, turnout change,
        lock/unlock turnout and call on.  This should be the main occupancy sensor.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Secondary O.S. Section occupied sensor</strong>: Optional.  Typically this is entered when a crossover
        is in an O.S. Section and you have two sensors, one for each parallel track.  This is the non-primary route, for
        instance the other side's track sensor.  When active, it prevents turnout change and lock/unlock turnout only.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Switch slaved to O.S. Section #</strong>: Optional.  Use this to slave another O.S. Section
        with <strong> just </strong> a turnout in it to this O.S. Section.  Used primarily when one track goes
        to 3 or more other tracks via multiple turnouts.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>No Code Button delay in milliseconds</strong>: Required.  If there is no Code Button (i.e. a tower
        operation), then put in the delay between when either the turnout or traffic direction switches are changed
        and when the action actually occurs.
        </p>

        <a name="frmSIDI" id="frmSIDI"></a>
        <h4>Signal direction indicators</h4>
        <p>
        Defines all of the information required for displaying the signal direction indicators on the CTC panel, and which
        signal(s) in the field control them.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Left, Normal and Right indicator sensors</strong>: Normal and one or both of Left and Right
        required.  The three indicators on the panel.  These names are automatically generated by the patterns
        system.  If this is a unidirectional O.S. Section, then leave either the Left or Right sensor blank (not both!).
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Coding and response time milliseconds: and Time locking interval milliseconds</strong>: Required.  Values
        are defaulted from the CTC Defaults screen.  Change as you see fit to make each section unique if you want.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Left to right and Right to left traffic signal lists</strong>: Here you specify each of the
        signal masts or individual signal heads associated in each direction with this O.S. Section.
        There must be at least one entry in each, <strong>unless</strong> it is a uni-directional O.S. Section.
        </p>

        <a name="frmSIDL" id="frmSIDL"></a>
        <h4>Signal direction lever</h4>
        <p>
        Defines all of the sensors required for the JMRI MultiSensor object in order to select a signal direction.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Left, Normal and Right lever sensors</strong>: Normal and one or both of Left and Right
        required.  This defines the three sensors associated with the 3 corresponding positions of the
        MultiSensor.  These names are automatically generated by the patterns system.  If this is a
        unidirectional O.S. Section, then leave either the Left or Right sensor blank (not both!).  The
        missing entry should match the corresponding missing entry in the Signal Direction Indicators
        for this O.S. Section.
        </p>

        <a name="frmSWDI" id="frmSWDI"></a>
        <h4>Switch direction indicators</h4>
        <p>
        Defines all of the information for displaying the switch direction indicators on the CTC panel, and
        which switch in the field controls them.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Normal and Reverse indicator sensors</strong>: Required.  The two indicators on the
        panel.  These names are automatically generated by the patterns system.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Actual turnout</strong>: Required.  The turnout who's information is being displayed.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Coding and response time milliseconds</strong>: Required.  Values are defaulted from
        the CTC Defaults screen.  Change as you see fit to make each section unique if you want.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Feedback different</strong>: JMRI does not support backwards feedback values, i.e. turnout
        is commanded to CLOSED, turnout reports THROWN.  Check this if your device's feedback is opposite
        from the commanded value.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Optional GUI parameters</strong>: Ignore this if you are not generating GUI information.  Otherwise
        select the type of turnout from the 3 radio buttons, Check "Left hand turnout" if so, and
        if "Crossover" is selected, then check "Other turnout also left handed" if so.
        </p>

        <a name="frmSWDL" id="frmSWDL"></a>
        <h4>Switch direction lever</h4>
        <p>
        Defines the one sensor associated with the Sensor icon lever.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Lever sensor</strong>: Required.  This name is automatically generated by the patterns system.
        </p>

        <a name="frmCO" id="frmCO"></a>
        <h4>Call On</h4>
        <p>
        Defines all of the information for controlling (allowing) call on aspect(s) to be displayed in the
        field.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Toggle sensor</strong>: Required.  This name is automatically generated by the patterns system.  This
        associates the toggle switch on the panel with this Call On.
        </p>

        <p>
        When you first enter this screen, there is nothing in
        the "Grouping list" area.  Once you have entered new entries, you may individually select an entry by
        clicking on it, and then the "Edit Below" and "Delete" buttons become available, along with
        various field(s) below being enabled for changing.  In order to get
        started, press "Add New" the first time here, and various fields below will be enabled
        based upon how you have configured you system for Signal Heads or Signal Masts via the "Configure &gt;
        Defaults" menu.
        Below all fields are described, but some may not be available based upon Signal Heads or Signal Masts
          selected:
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Signal</strong>: Required.  Choose from the signals defined in your system already.  Then
        select in the drop down to the right of this field whether the signal faces Left or Right.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Aspect</strong>: Required.  Choose from the available aspects in the drop down list.  <strong>Do not</strong>
        choose flashing aspects for semaphores!  The semaphore will act weird as it tries and fails to keep up with
        the stream of movements.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Called on sensor</strong>: Required.  Choose from the sensors defined in your system already.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Block</strong>: Required.  Choose from the blocks defined in your system already.  You <strong>must</strong> manually
        check in JMRI the "Permissive" checkbox for this block in order for call on to work for this block, which is outside
        the scope of this editor.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>--- Route ---</strong>  Choose up to 6 switch direction indicators that when lit specify the
        route from the O.S. Section to the called on block (Signal Masts) or sensor associated with the block (Signal Heads).
        </p>

        <a name="frmTRL" id="frmTRL"></a>
        <h4>Traffic Locking</h4>
        <p>
        Defines all of the allowed non conflicting routes from the selected O.S. Section in either direction from it.
        This is the beating heart of the CTC system.  As such, it is the most complex part of CTC you will encounter.
        However, if you are methodical and after some experience, you should find that this section is fairly straight
        forward.
        </p>
        <p>
        When you initially select Traffic Locking, the first screen that comes up will allow you to edit one of the
        directions from this O.S. Section to other O.S. Section(s).  <strong>Note:</strong> Having no rules <strong>always</strong> allows
        that direction of travel no matter any other condition, and may be valid in certain situations such as traveling
        to staging where there is no O.S. Section.
        </p>

        <p>
        Select either Left or Right to proceed.  On the next screen that appears, you will notice that the "Rules:"
        area is blank, and that "Add New" is only button enabled.  Press "Add New" now, and notice how the bottom half of the
        screen is enabled for editing of this new rule.
        </p>

        <p>
        Before we proceed to details on this rule, you will notice that "This rule ENABLED" is checked by default.  You
        may enable / disable individual rules at your whim, you mostly disable ones so that the information is not lost,
        and you may in the future want to re-enable it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Part of the design of your CTC system (which has nothing to do with this program) is determining where
        the interlocking limits are in complex trackwork situations, such as parallel (or 3 or more) tracks with
        multiple switches and crossovers.  It is beyond the scope of this help in guiding you in designing
        interlocking plants.  For instance, it depends on how you want simultaneous moves to occur within
        interlocking limits that may need to be considered.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Specifying a rule:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        Under "--- ROUTE ---", you specify the O.S. Section(s) traversed, and the switch alignment associated with each
        O.S. Section for that route.  Order of specified O.S. Section(s) is irrelevant.  For a simple route,
        such as a passing siding, there will only be one switch.  A complex interlocking will normally have several
        switches.  An O.S. Section that contains a turnout will have at least two routes, a closed route and a thrown route.
        </p>
        <p>
        Under "Occupancy sensors ... allowed." you specify the sensor(s) that will be locked for that route.  For simple routes, the O.S.
        section occupancy sensor and the occupancy sensor for the destination block will be specified.
        </p>
        <p>
        Under "--- Optional sensors... valid ---", specify any sensors that must be ACTIVE to allow this rule to be valid.
        You may (for instance) use JMRI Logix to create such a sensor for specific unusual situations.
        <strong>Important:</strong> These optional sensors are <strong>not</strong> allocated as part of the rule.
        They are just checked at the moment the dispatcher codes the O.S. Section.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Final result: </strong> When the dispatcher codes this O.S. Section,
        the <strong>Left</strong> or <strong>Right</strong> rule set is selected based on
        the position of the signal lever.  A specific rule is then selected based on the
        turnout positions.  If all of the occupancy sensors defined in the rule are inactive
        <strong>and</strong> not already allocated to another route,
        along with optional sensors if defined, then the occupancy sensors are allocated.  The allocation for each occupancy sensor is removed
        after it becomes occupied and then unoccupied.
        </p>
        <p>
        In complex interlocking situations: as a train traverses the rule's occupancy sensor(s) and transited occupancy sensor(s) are released,
        other rules that don't conflict with the remaining allocated occupancy sensors may be allowed before this train
        has fully transited this whole rule, and the dispatcher may select these routes (rules) safely.
        </p>

        <a name="frmTUL" id="frmTUL"></a>
        <h4>Turnout locking</h4>
        <p>
        <strong>Background:</strong>
        On my layout for main line turnouts, I have a local push button for each DS-54 and DS-64 that locally requests
        the turnout to "flip" the other way.  By locally, I mean no computer involvement.  I originally designed it
        this way so that if the computer failed for any reason, the layout could still be operated without any
        computer system involvement.  This is fail safe: No computer, "Mother may I" via phones to the Dispatcher
        with a magnet (or some such) board of the track plan for collision avoidance.
        </p>
        <p>
        All of the main line turnouts on my layout use the other bit available of 2 available inputs for each turnout
        on the DS-54 or DS-64 for feedback.  JMRI's parlance for this is "Mode = INDIRECT" in the Turnouts table.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>How "Lock implementation: Greg's" works in this situation (the ONLY supported possibility at this time):</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        If the JMRI software monitored the LocoNet network for turnout commands, the switch could not
        be locked properly, because the local button generates no messages to LocoNet.  However, with the
        feedback available (INDIRECT), what my software does is when it sees a feedback message that disagrees
        with the locked state of the turnout, it immediately send a countermand command to restore the turnout
        to its proper locked state that the dispatcher wants/controls.  As a consequence, an operator when
        pushing the local push button while the dispatcher has the switch locked notices that the switch goes
        about 1/2 way, and then returns to its locked position.  Repeated pushing of the switch just repeats
        this.  The dispatcher will see the Switch indicators blink back and forth without input from the
        dispatcher, so they know someone is trying to wrongly change the switch.  One could say that by
        the switch going 1/2 way, a train going over the switch would derail, and you'd be correct.  But
        since my layout has the push buttons right next to the switch it controls, hopefully an operator
        won't attempt to purposely derail a train.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are two main situations that need to be considered separately:
        </p>
        <p>
        Turnout locks in an O.S. Section:
        </p>
        <p>
        This is the typical case, and requires nothing special be done.  In the prototype, the O.S. Section <strong>must be</strong> unoccupied
        in order for a turnout to be unlocked.  Locking a turnout can always occur at any time.  There are two situations to be considered:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>The turnout has local control but that is never granted by the dispatcher.</li>
        <li>The turnout has local control that can be granted to the crews in the field by the dispatcher.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        1. is for all main line turnouts typically, that do not go to a siding that is switched by the crews.  In this way the turnout
        is locked permanently, and the dispatcher cannot grant local control.  In this case, press "Just" a locked turnout, and fields
        are cleared that are not needed, which are fields Dispatcher sensor lock toggle, Dispatcher sensor unlocked
        indicator.  The field Actual turnout is required.
        </p>
        <p>
        2. is for those turnouts that are normally locked by the dispatcher, but the local crews can ask
        for local control to do switching.
        </p>
        <p>
        Configure the rest of the screen as needed.
        </p>

        <p>
        Turnout locks in a non O.S. Section (and how to create them):
        </p>
        <p>
        Just create the section that contains the turnout <strong>as if</strong> it was an O.S. Section.  Use a switch number
        that is higher than the highest value you will use on the CTC machine, or for safety, use values starting with
        1001.  For the GUI column #, use the proper number to create both the Code Button and the lock/unlock toggle
        switch in the proper place.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, <strong>do not</strong> check any features except the Turnout Locking check box for this fake O.S.
        section.  This is how this is differentiated from the above true O.S. Section lock.
        </p>
        <p>
        When configuring the Code Button, you will be required to enter an occupancy sensor.  Enter the occupancy sensor <Strong>containing</Strong> the turnout to be locked.
        </p>
        <p>
        For this situation, the prototype <strong>required</strong> occupancy of that section to exist when unlock(s) of the turnout(s) are to occur.  The
        purpose of this on the prototype is safety: so that the Dispatcher does not accidentally unlock an unoccupied block and leave
        it that way, thereby possibly causing a derailment sometime in the future, or for signals to not clear into this block
        </p>
        <p>
        Feedbacks different check boxes:
        </p>
        <p>
        Normally, the feedback value matches the commanded value.  JMRI allows for both being backwards, and in order to
        fix that, you put a check the "Inverted" column in the Turnout Table in JMRI.  However, in case the feedback value
        is different than the commanded value, then you put a check in that column.  The following table lists the possibilities:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Command:</th>
                <th>Feedback:</th>
                <th>JMRI Turnout inverted checked:</th>
                <th>CTC Editor feedbacks different checked:</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Normal</td>
                <td>Normal</td>

    <h2>Files</h2>
    All files for the CTC system are stored in the "ctc" directory under the User Files Location.
    In order to access this directory, on the main JMRI screen, press "Help", then
    select "Locations".  This will bring up a JMRI screen with all of the possible locations.  Press
    "Open User Files Location".  That will open up the file manager at that location.  You should notice
    a "ctc" directory under it.  Navigate to it.  What follows is a discussion of the files located there.
    <h3>CTCSystem.xml and all CTCSystem.xml?.bup files</h3>
    CTCSystem.xml contains all of your information that you've entered for the CTC system.  The ".bup" files
    are prior versions made each time you save the CTCSystem.xml file.
    <h3>ProgramProperties.xml and all ProgramProperties.xml.?.bup files</h3>
    ProgramProperties.xml contains all of the configurable parameters of the CTC system.  Primarily it contains
    the parameters specfied under all of the "Configure" options on the main CTC Editor screen.
    The "bup" files are prior versions of this file.
    <h3>AwtWindowProperties.txt</h3>
    This file contains location and size information for all CTC Editor dialogs, so that when you locate
    a dialog on the screen, the next time you either resize or relocate it, it will be opened at this
    same location and size.  You can freely delete it at any time.
    <h3>Optional files</h3>
    All of the following files may or may not exist.  Once the
    "Write .xml files for JMRI GUI support" is pressed on the main CTC Editor screen, they are created.  They are created anew
    each time the "Write .xml files for JMRI GUI support" is pressed.
    <h3>GUIObjects.xml</h3>
    It contains all of the basic GUI JMRI objects necessary for creating a "raw" CTC panel in the Panel
    Editor.  It can be loaded at any time using the Panels &gt; Open Panels... menu (on the main JMRI screen)
    and specifying this location and filename to load.
    <h3>InternalSensors.xml</h3>
    It contains <strong>all</strong> of the sensors created by the CTC Editor.  These sensors are required
    for proper operation of the CTC panel.

    <h3>VirtualSignals.xml</h3>
    Deprecated and obsolete.  You may freely delete it.
    <h2>CTC integration of sensors and a populated Panel Editor panel</h2>
    There are two basic types of sensors needed by the CTC system: sensors that are backed by real objects
    on the layout and are <strong>not</strong> created by this system, and "soft" sensors that are created
    as needed by this program for objects on the CTC Panel Editor panel (indicators, levers, toggles, push
    buttons, etc.).  These "soft" sensors definitions are created in the InternalSensors.xml file (mentioned
    above), which you can load via "Open Panel".  You may load this file multiple times, there is no danger
    doing this.
    <h2>CTC integration of panel objects created in the GUIObjects.xml file</h2>
    Each time a new CTC column is defined, and the "Write .xml files for JMRI GUI support" button is pressed,
    <strong>only</strong> the NEW column(s) <strong>since</strong> the button was last pressed are written
    to the file.
    <p>
    If you select an existing O.S. Section and press "Change Switch and Signal Etc. #'s:", the next screen
    contains a checkbox "GUI Generated before".  As each entry is written to the GUIObjects.xml file, this
    checkbox is automatically checked.  If you want, you may clear the checkbox and the next time GUIObjects.xml
    is generated, those O.S. Section(s) will appear again in it, and the checkbox will be re-checked again.
    </p>
    <p>
    Do not load the GUIObjects.xml file more than once, otherwise you will have many duplicate items on the screen.
    </p>
    <h2>Proper development cycle</h2>
    Using the CTC Editor, first define all of your O.S. Sections to the <strong>best</strong> of your knowledge,
    then create and then load the GUIObjects.xml panel in, and review the results.  If you are not happy, then
    <strong>delete</strong> the panel, save the panel file, and re-iterate the process
    (i.e. CTC Editor, write files, etc.).

    <a name="ctcMain" id="ctcMain"></a>
    <h2>CTCMain</h2>
    <strong>Remember:</strong> Before you start CTC Runtime, you <strong>need</strong> to load the panel.
    <strong>Ideally:</strong> Before you start CTC Editor, you also should load the panel to get
    reference checking of your JMRI objects (turnouts, sensors, etc.).
    <h3>Starting it up</h3>
    After defining the CTC system using the CTC Editor, you will need to start it up.
    On the main PanelPro screen, under Tools/CTC, you will see the selection
    "Run CTC Logic".  This will start it up right now (on demand real time).
    <p>
    For ease of access during development: if you want to define button(s) on the main PanelPro screen to do this (or
    to also invoke the CTC Editor via another button), do the following: From the main PanelPro screen,
    select Edit &gt; Preferences... (PanelPro &gt; Preferences... on macOS) menu, select the Start Up tab,
    press Add &gt; Add button to main window..., scroll to "Start CTC Runtime" and select it.<br>
    To ad a button that opens CTC Editor, do the same but instead scroll to "Open CTC Editor" and select it.
    </p>
    <p>
    To start it up as part of the startup of JMRI: Select Edit &gt; Preferences... (PanelPro &gt; Preferences... on
    macOS), select the Start Up tab, press Add &gt; Perform Action, and select "Start CTC Runtime".
    </p>
    <h2>Global sensors and the icons associated with them</h2>
    Debug (default: IS:DEBUGCTC), Reload (default: IS:RELOADCTC) and Fleeting (default: IS:FLEETING).
    <p>
    Debug and Reload can be accessed via CTC Editor menu Configure &gt; Debugging.  Fleeting
    can be accessed via CTC Editor menu Configure &gt; Fleeting.
    </p>
    <p>
    These are convenience functions, and can be removed at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
    For support of conditional preconditioning, there is sensor "IS:PRECONDITIONING_ENABLED" that is
    automatically created.  If set to ACTIVE, it allows preconditioning on all O.S. sections.
    </p>
    <h3>Debug</h3>
    When this toggle switch is turned on (not off), it will dump out all of the
    presently locked routes in the system, and for each route will list the
    resource(s) still allocated to the route onto the JMRI System Console screen.
    <p>
    While this toggle is on, each time a Code Button is pressed and a signal direction
    lever for that Code Button selects a direction of travel, the program will
    list out the single rule that was satisfied (if any).  If none are listed,
    then none were satisfied.  Note: Even if a rule is valid, the ABS system
    may not clear up a signal in the direction indicated, and the CTC system
    will re-lock that O.S. Section.
    </p>
    <h3>Reload</h3>
    When this button is pressed, the CTC system will reload the last saved
    CTC Editor session.  Remember: When you make changes to the CTC system
    via the CTC Editor, save the results before pressing this button.
    <p>
    After this button is pressed, the CTC system will be <strong>completely</strong>
    re-initialized to it's starting position(s).  Also, remember to look at
    the JMRI System Console for any new errors.
    </p>
    <p>
    You <strong>should</strong> remove this button after all debugging is completed,
    so that your dispatcher doesn't accidentally push it during a session.
    </p>
    <h3>Fleeting</h3>
    Fleeting is a concept within "normal" CTC, and may not be useful.  Most
    model (not prototype) dispatchers don't use it even if available, due to the
    "speed" of the layout's status changing.

      <dt>Running time</dt>
      <dd>
        <p style="margin: 10px 0">
          When a dispatcher had previously cleared a route thru an interlocking or O.S. Section, and it is still clear,
          and then the dispatcher now attempts to change their mind and bring signals to stop, the system will run time
          and lock the route and signals during that time.  At the end of that time, the CTC system will release and
          then allow a new route and signal state to be established.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 10px 0">
          Why? Locomotive engineers always expect a yellow
          signal of some form before an absolute stop red signal at a Home signal of an O.S. Section.  This gives the
          engineer time to begin slowing the train upon approaching the yellow approach signal expecting a possible
          red signal at the next home signal.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 10px 0">
          If the dispatcher was allowed to immediately change a Green home
          signal to a Red signal it is possible that a locomotive engineer just passed that prior approach signal
          and saw Green, and now expects at worst to see Yellow at the home signal.  In this situation, the train
          may be traveling too fast to stop in time at the Home signal's red signal, and actually overshoot it
          and enter the interlocking.  By locking down the plant during this time, the route and signals already
          established may allow this overshooting train to enter the interlocking in a safe manner.  The amount
          time associated with this "running time" depends on many factors in real life: Train speed on the
          segment of track, sighting distances, etc.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 10px 0">
          On a model railroad, due to such short distances and the fact that our models can "stop on a dime"
          relative to a real train, and the fact that we are running typically with fast clocks, you may want
          to limit this time to say (my default) 5 seconds.  Otherwise a busy layout may come to a screeching
          halt.  Some layouts use 30 seconds or 1 minute to "force" Dispatchers to think ahead and prevent
          this situation.  Your choice.

          Used to allow "back to train" movements.  Normally, CTC systems prevent signals being
          cleared into an occupied section of track.  Example: When an engineer is attempting a
          run around move, and as the last part of the run around attempts to rejoin their train.  The
          CTC system and trackside signals (the vital signal logic) will actively prevent that.  Pressing
          (or toggling) the Call on feature while pressing the Code Button bypasses the safety checks of
          the Vital signal logic and CTC systems, and allows that signal to go to its most restrictive
          aspect.  Now the engineer will get a non-red indication which allows them to rejoin their train.

          systems "sit on top of" the Vital signal logic trackside.  CTC cannot clear a signal.  CTC can
          only allow the vital signal logic to allow a signal to go "non-Red".  Most of the time this
          vital signal logic is implemented by ABS or APB systems.  In JMRI, this is known as "SSL" - Simple
