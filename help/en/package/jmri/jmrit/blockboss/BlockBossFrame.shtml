      <p>The documentation below describes Signaling with JMRI
      using an older tool, SSL, and discusses how to set up basic
      signaling situations with it.</p>

      <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Simple Signal Logic (SSL) provided the first method to
      enable the rapid setup of basic Automatic Block Signaling
      (ABS) style signaling in JMRI. For more complex operations
      beyond the capability of SSL refer to the newer and preferred
      method of Signal Mast Logic on the <a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/signaling/index.shtml">Signaling main
      help page</a>. Note that SSL ignores any Signal Mast objects
      and only drives individual Signal Heads.<br>
      <b>Don't use the SSL Tool when you have already built Signal
      Masts and the more advanced Signal Mast Logic in the same
      Panel/Configuration file.</b><br>
      SSL has no option to delete an SSL entry or provide an overview
      of all SSL rules other than looking at the XML file of your
      Panel, so make notes as you add SSL items and back up your
      configuration XML file.</p>

      <p>Much of basic ABS signaling can be boiled down to "a
      Signal Head goes red when a train can't safely enter the
      block it protects; it goes yellow when the block following
      the protected block can't be entered". Although that's a
      simplification, it can serve as a powerful starting point for
      understanding signaling logic.</p>

      <p>The SSL user interface was designed to be user friendly to
      all users with basic familiarity with JMRI. SSL provides a
      means for setting up basic signals in an intuitive manner,
      without the user having to be familiar with all of the logic
      necessary to account for the different Signal Aspects.
      <a href="../../../../images/SslExample.png"><img src=

      width="452" height="287" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt=
      "Simple Signal Logic panel figure"></a></p>

      <p>The Simple Signal Logic Tool allows you to configure JMRI
      to use a basic ABS type of logic to set the appearance of
      Signal Heads. Using the SSL Tool, you enter information for
      each Signal Head on:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>For Signal Head:</b> The Signal Head being
        driven.</li>

        <li><b>Protects Sensor/s:</b> Which sensors (occupancy
        detectors) cover the block immediately past the signal.
        When any of these sensors show "active" the Signal Head
        will be set to red.</li>

        <li><b>Red When Turnout:</b> If the block contains a
        Turnout, pick or enter the Turnout System Name and use the
        selection buttons to choose whether you're entering the
        Closed or Thrown leg. The Signal Head will be set to Rred
        whenever the turnout is set against this track.</li>

        <li><b>Protects Signal:</b> The next Signal Head that the
        train will reach; this Signal Head will be set Yellow if
        the next signal head is red.</li>

        <li><b>With Flashing Yellow</b> If the checkbox is checked,
        the Signal Head will be set flashing yellow (JMRI will
        alternate between Dark and Yellow) if the next protected
        signal head is yellow, thereby giving four-block
        signaling.</li>

        <li><b>Limited Speed</b> If this checkbox is checked, this
        Signal Head will be set to Yellow as the least restrictive
        Aspect.</li>

        <li><b>Restricting Speed</b> If this checkbox is checked, this
        Signal Head will be set to Flashing Red as the least restrictive
        Aspect.</li>

        <li><b>Is Distant Signal</b> If this checkbox is checked,
        this Signal will be set to the most restrictive aspect of
        either this Signal Head or the next protected Signal
        Head.</li>

        <li><b>Approach Lighting Sensor:</b> The sensor that
        controls whether this Signal Head is lit or not. Only the
        actual hardware Signal Head on the layout will go dark.
        Panel indicators will show the normal signal Appearance.
        Leave this entry blank to always show Lit.</li>

        <li><b>Facing Point Turnout</b> The Signal Head is located
        on the single track side of the Turnout, facing a choice of
        two or more tracks in the direction of travel.</li>

        <li><b>Trailing Point Turnout</b> The Signal Head is
        located on the double track side of the Turnout, facing a
        single track in the direction of travel.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The case of a facing point turnout which leads to two
      different "Protected Signals" is also covered although the
      above figure doesn't show it. If a single Signal Head is used
      to control both branches, then choose "On Facing-Point
      Turnout". If a different Signal Head will control each route,
      then simply choose "Main" or "Diverging" leg of turnout, as
      required for each one.</p>

      <p>Pause your mouse over any entry or item in the SSL
      creation pane for a brief "tooltip" help reminder.</p>

      <p>It's clear that SSL won't cover complicated interlockings
      nor will it cover the speed-signaling seen on some
      prototypes. However, when combined with the logic
      capabilities of JMRI <a href=
      "../../../html/tools/Routes.shtml">Routes</a> and <a href=
      "../../../html/tools/Logix.shtml">Logix</a>, SSL can be used
      to create a CTC panel, as Bob Bucklew shows on <a href=
      "http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/QV_CTCnew.html">his web
      site</a>.</p><a name="start" id="start"></a>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <p>Follow these steps to create your first JMRI Signal and
      become familiar with the SSL user interface. As a starter
      this example defines just one "virtual" Signal Head that
      doesn't really exist on the layout, so it can work with any
      kind of layout hardware. See the <a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/signaling/index.shtml">Signaling main
      help page</a> for information on how to set up your own
      signals.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select <b>Signal Heads</b> in the PanelPro
        <b>Tools &gt; Tables &gt; Signals</b> menu.</li>

        <li>In the Signal Head Table window that appears, click
        the <b>Add...</b> button to begin defining a new signal
        head.</li>

        <li>In the Add New Signal Head pane that appears, choose the
        "Virtual Signal" type.</li>

        <li>Enter a system name such as "IH1000".</li>

        <li>Click <b>Create</b> to enter this head into the Signal Head
        Table.</li>

        <li>Enter all the Signal Heads that you will be using for
        this test, using different names. The actual name doesn't
        matter, they just have to be different.</li>

        <li>Now select <b>Simple Signal Logic...</b> in the
        <b>Tools</b> menu.</li>

        <li>Fill in the various entries to match your signal's
        requirements as previously shown.</li>

        <li>Click <b>Apply</b> to make this entry active.</li>

        <li>Be sure to save your work.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You have just created an SSL entry to control a Signal
      Head. It's as simple as that. It took you more time to read
      this tutorial than to create your first SSL entry.<br>
      The following example would allow you to build actual Simple
      Signal Logic for signals connected to a specific kind of DCC
      system:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select <b>Tables &gt; Turnouts</b> in the <b>Tools</b>
        menu.</li>

        <li>Check to be sure that the outputs (Turnout addresses)
        that will control your Signals Heads are in the Turnout
        Table. If not, click the <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom
        of the Turnout Table.</li>

        <li>In the Add New Turnout window that appears, enter a
        System Name, (e.g. "LT1") and "test" for User Name, then
        click <b>Create</b>.<br>
        <i>Note:</i> All System Names of JMRI objects must follow
        the JMRI Naming rules, starting with a capital prefix for
        the DCC connection type (e.g. "L" for LocoNet) followed bij a
        capital T in the case of Turnouts and the actual hardware
        address of the Turnout.</li>

        <li>Clicking on the corresponding <b>Closed/Thrown</b>
        entries in the Turnout Table should now cause your Signal
        Head to change state.</li>

        <li>Select <b>Signal Heads</b> in the <b>Tools &gt; Tables
        &gt; Signals</b> menu.</li>

        <li>In the Signal Head Table window that appears, click
        <b>Add...</b> to begin defining a new Signal Head.</li>

        <li>In the Add New Signal window that appears choose the
        correct signal type to match your hardware. The required
        item boxes will appear.</li>

        <li>Enter a System Name, for example "LH152". <i>Note:</i>
        Signal Head system names must start with the connection
        prefix plus "H" for Head (i.e. CH, IH, LH, NH, XH, etc.)
        and be followed by the hardware address ("number") of the
        Signal Head.</li>

        <li>Next pick or create one or more Turnouts that will
        control this Signal Head. <i>Note:</i> In the case of
        SE8C connected signals, just enter the first Turnout number
        of each pair.
        The second Turnout number is automatically known.</li>

        <li>Click <b>Create</b> to enter this head into the Signal
        Head Table.</li>

        <li>Enter all the Signal Heads that you will be using.</li>

        <li>Now select <b>Simple Signal Logic...</b> in the
        PanelPro <b>Tools</b> menu.</li>

        <li>Fill in the various entries to match the requirements
        of your first signal as previously shown.</li>

        <li>Click <b>Apply</b> to make this entry active.</li>

        <li>Repeat steps 13-14 for each of your Signal Heads.</li>

        <li>Be sure to save your work by selecting "Store Panels..."
        from the Panels menu.</li>
      </ol>
