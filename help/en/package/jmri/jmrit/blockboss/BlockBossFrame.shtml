JMRI: Simple Signal Logic
</h1>

<a name="contents"><h2>Contents</h2></a>

<p>The documentation below describes Signaling with JMRI using an older tool, SSL, and discusses how to set 
up basic signaling situations with it.

<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>Simple Signal Logic (SSL) provided the first method to enable the rapid setup of basic Automatic Block Signaling (ABS) style signaling in JMRI. 
	For more complex operations beyond the capability of SSL refer to the newer and preferred method of Signal Mast Logic on the <a href="../../../../html/tools/signaling/index.shtml">Signaling main help page</a>. Note that SSL ignores any Signal Mast objects and only drives individual Signal Heads.<br/>
	<b>Don't use the SSL Tool when you have already built Signal Masts and the more advanced Signal Mast Logic in the same Panel/Configuration file.</b><br/>
	SSL has no tool to delete an SSL entry or provide an overview of all SSL rules other than looking at the XML file of your Panel, so make notes as you add SSL items and back up your configuration XML file.


<p>Much of basic ABS signaling can be boiled down to "a Signal Head goes red when a train
can't safely enter the block it protects; it goes yellow when the block following 
the protected block can't be entered". Although that's a simplification, it can serve
as a powerful starting point for understanding signaling logic.
	
	<p>The SSL user interface was designed to be user friendly to
	all users with basic familiarity with JMRI. SSL provides a means
	for setting up basic signals in an intuitive manner, without the 
	user having to be familiar with all of the logic necessary to account for the different Signal Aspects.

<p>
The Simple Signal Logic Tool allows you to configure JMRI to 
use a basic ABS type of logic to set the appearance of Signal Heads. 
Using the SSL Tool, you enter information for each Signal Head on:
<ul>
<li><b>Signal Head Named</b> The Signal Head being driven.</li>
<li><b>Protects Sensor/s</b> Which sensors (occupancy detectors) cover the block
immediately past the signal. When any of these sensors show "active" the 
Signal Head will be set to red.</li>
<li><b>Red When Turnout</b> If the block contains a Turnout, 
enter the Turnout System Name and use the selection button to choose whether you're entering
the Closed or Thrown leg. The Signal Head will be set to red
whenever the turnout is set against this track.</li>
<li><b>Protects Signal</b> The next Signal Head that the train will reach;
this Signal Head will be set Yellow if the next signal head is
red.</li>  
<li><b>With Flashing Yellow</b> If the checkbox is checked, the Signal Head will be set
flashing yellow (JMRI will alternate between Dark and Yellow) if the
next protected signal head is yellow, thereby giving four-block signaling.</li>
<li><b>Limited Speed</b> If the checkbox is checked, this Signal Head will be set
to Yellow as the least restrictive Aspect.</li>
<li><b>Is Distant Signal</b> If the checkbox is checked, this Signal will be set
to the most restrictive aspect of either this Signal Head or the next protected Signal Head.</li>
<li><b>Approach Lighting Sensor</b> The sensor that controls whether this Signal Head is lit or not. Only the
actual hardware Signal Head on the layout will go dark. Panel indicators will show the normal signal Appearance. 
Leave this entry blank to always show Lit.</li>
<li><b>Facing Point Turnout</b> The Signal Head is located on the single track side of the Turnout, 
facing a choice of two or more tracks in the direction of travel.</li>
<li><b>Trailing Point Turnout</b> The Signal Head is located on the double track side of the Turnout, 
facing a single track in the direction of travel.</li></ul>
		
<p>The case of a facing point turnout which leads to two different "Protected Signals" is also covered although the above figure doesn't show it.

If a single Signal Head is used to control both branches, then choose "On Facing-Point
Turnout". If a different Signal Head will control each route, then simply choose "Main"
or "Diverging" leg of turnout, as required for each one.
<p>Pause your mouse over any entry or item in the SSL creation window for a brief "tooltip" help 
reminder.</p>

<p>It's clear that this won't cover complicated interlockings nor will it 
cover the speed-signaling seen on some prototypes. However, when combined with the logic capabilities of JMRI
<a href="../../../html/tools/Routes.shtml">Routes</a> and <a href="../../../html/tools/Logix.shtml">Logix</a>,
SSL can be used to create a CTC panel, as Bob Bucklew shows on
<a href="http://www.quaker-valley.com/CTC/QV_CTCnew.html">his web site</a>.

<a name="start"><h2>Getting Started</h2></a>

<p>Follow these steps to create your first JMRI Signal and become familiar
with the SSL user interface. As a starter this example defines just one "virtual" Signal
Head that doesn't really exist on the layout, so it can work with any kind of layout hardware.
See the <a href="../../../../html/tools/signaling/index.shtml">Signaling main help page</a>
for information on how to set up your own signals.
</p><ol>
<li> Select <b>Signal Head Table</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu.
</li><li> In the Signal Head Table window that appears, click <b>Add</b> to begin defining a new signal head.
</li><li> In the Add New Signal window that appears choose the "Virtual Signal" type.
</li><li> Enter a system name such as IH1000.
</li><li> Click <b>OK</b> to enter this head into the Signal Head Table.  
</li><li> Enter all the signal heads that you will be using for this test, using different names.
The actual name doesn't matter, they just have to be different.
<li> Now select <b>Simple Signal Logic</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu.
</li><li> Fill in the various entries to match your signals requirements as 
previously shown.
</li><li> Click <b>Apply</b> to make this entry active.</li>
		<li> Be sure to save your work.</li>
</ol>

	<p>You have just created an SSL entry to control a Signal Head. It's as 
simple as that. It took you more time to read this tutorial than to create your first SSL entry.	    
		<br/>The following example would allow you to build actual Simple Signal Logic for signals connected to a specific kind of DCC system:</p>
		
<ol>
		<li> Select <b>Tables > Turnouts</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu.
		</li><li> Check to be sure that the outputs (Turnout addresses) that will control your Signals Heads are in the Turnout Table. If not, click the <b>Add</b> button at the bottom of the Turnout Table.
		</li><li> In the Add New Turnout window that appears, enter a system name, (e.g. LT1)
	and "test" for user name, then click <b>OK</b>.<br/>
	<i>Note:</i> All System Names of JMRI objects must follow the JMRI Naming rules, starting with a capital letter for the DCC connection type (e.g. L for LocoNet) followed bij a capital T
in the case of Turnouts and the actual hardware number of the Turnout.
		</li><li>Clicking on the corresponding <b>Closed/Thrown</b> entries in the Turnout Table should now cause your Signal Head to change.
		</li><li>Select <b>Signal Head Table</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu.
		</li><li>In the Signal Head Table window that appears, click <b>Add...</b> to begin defining a new Signal Head.
		</li><li>In the Add New Signal window that appears choose the correct signal type to 
		match your hardware. The required item boxes will appear.
		</li><li>Enter a system name. For example LH152. <i>Note:</i> Signal Head system names must start 
		with CH, IH, LH, NH, XH, etc. and be followed by the number of the Signal Head.
		</li><li>Next enter one or more Turnout numbers that will control this signal. <i>Note:</i> In the case of
		SE8c style signals just enter the first Turnout number of each pair. The second Turnout number is automatically known. 
		</li><li>Click <b>OK</b> to enter this head into the Signal Head Table.  
		</li><li>Enter all the Signal Heads that you will be using.
	</li><li> Now select <b>Simple Signal Logic</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu.
		</li><li>Fill in the various entries to match the requirements of your first Signal (Head) as 
		previously shown.
		</li><li>Click <b>Apply</b> to make this entry active.
		</li><li>Repeat steps 13-14 for each of your Signal Heads
	</li><li>Be sure to save your work by selecting "Save Panels..." from the Panels menu.</li>
