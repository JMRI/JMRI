JMRI: Send Problem Report
</h1>

The "Send Problem Report" item in JMRI Help menus
lets you file a problem report where the JMRI developers
can easily find it.  The report contains all
of the information on your JMRI installation, including the
log from the most recent running of the program,
but doesn't contain any of your private information.
You can see previous problem reports in the 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=jmri-reports">archive on SourceForge</a>.

<p>
To make the report most useful, you should 
send the report as soon as possible after encountering
the problem, so that any useful information hasn't been
overwritten.

<p>
The "Send Problem Report" help item will open a new window
with three fields and two checkboxes.  
Enter your email address in the top line.
It won't be made visible to the public, but we 
do require a valid email address to cut down on spam.
In the next field, enter a one-line summary of the problem
that will appear as the subject of the report.
Finally, type a few lines describing want went wrong, now to 
recreate it, etc.

<p>
Normally, you leave the two checkboxes marked so that the report
will contain the context information (JMRI version, Java version,
hardware types, etc) and the most recent log files.  If you 
don't want to include those for some reason, just uncheck the them.

<p>
Finally, push send.  If everything goes OK, the window will close itself
in a couple of seconds after the report has been sent.
