      <h1>JMRI: Upload Debugging Information</h1>
      <a href="SampleReportForm.png"><img src="SampleReportForm.png" height="25%" width="25%" align="right"></a>
      <p>The "Upload
      Debugging Information" item in JMRI Help menus lets you store
      debugging information where the JMRI developers can easily
      find it. The information contains all of the specific details
      of your JMRI installation, including the log from the most
      recent running of the program, but doesn't contain any of
      your private information. You can see previous problem
      reports on the <a href=
      "https://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/mailman/jmri-reports/">jmri-reports
      mailing list</a>.</p>

      <p>To make the information most useful, you should do the
      upload as soon as possible after encountering the problem, so
      that any useful information hasn't been overwritten.</p>

      <p>The "Upload Debugging Information" help item will open a
      new window with three fields and six checkboxes. Enter your
      email address in the top line. It won't be made visible to
      the public, but we do require a valid email address to cut
      down on spam. In the next field, enter a one-line summary of
      the problem that will appear as the subject of the upload.
      Finally, type a few lines describing want went wrong, how to
      recreate it, etc.</p>

      <p>Normally, you leave the checkboxes marked so that the
      report will contain the context information (JMRI version,
      Java version, hardware types, etc) and the most recent log
      files. If you don't want to include those for some reason,
      just uncheck them.</p>

      <p>Finally, push send. If everything goes OK, the window will
      close itself in a couple of seconds after the information has
      been sent.</p>

      <p><b>Note: Uploading this information will not necessarily
      result in somebody leaping up to fix your problem.</b> This
      is not a support request, it's just a convenient way to get
      your program information where people can see it.</p>

      <p>If you want quick help with a problem, you should talk
      with some JMRI users in your area (it's always good to talk
      to friends), or ask on the <a href=
      "https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRI
      users group</a>.</p>
