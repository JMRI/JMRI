JMRI: Upload Debugging Information
</h1>

The "Upload Debugging Information" item in JMRI Help menus
lets you store debugging information where the JMRI developers
can easily find it.  The information contains all
of the specific details of your JMRI installation, including the
log from the most recent running of the program,
but doesn't contain any of your private information.
You can see previous problem reports on the 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/mailman/jmri-reports/">jmri-reports SourceForge mailing list</a>.

<p>
To make the information most useful, you should 
do the upload as soon as possible after encountering
the problem, so that any useful information hasn't been
overwritten.

<p>
The "Upload Debugging Information" help item will open a new window
with three fields and two checkboxes.  
Enter your email address in the top line.
It won't be made visible to the public, but we 
do require a valid email address to cut down on spam.
In the next field, enter a one-line summary of the problem
that will appear as the subject of the upload.
Finally, type a few lines describing want went wrong, now to 
recreate it, etc.

<p>
Normally, you leave the two checkboxes marked so that the report
will contain the context information (JMRI version, Java version,
hardware types, etc) and the most recent log files.  If you 
don't want to include those for some reason, just uncheck the them.

<p>
Finally, push send.  If everything goes OK, the window will close itself
in a couple of seconds after the information has been sent.

<p>
<b>Note: Uploading this information will not necessarily 
result in somebody leaping up to fix your problem.</b> 
This is not a support request, it's just a convenient 
way to get your program information where people can see it.

<p>
If you want quick help with 
a problem, you should talk some JMRI users in your area (it's always good to
talk to friends), or ask on the 
<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">JMRI users Yahoo group</a>.
