      <h1>JMRI: LogixNG Debugger</h1>

      <p>Sometimes it can be difficult to understand exactly what's going on in a ConditionalNG.
      LogixNG therefore has a debugger that allows to step by step walk thru a ConditionalNG to
      see what it's actually doing.</p>

      <p>To use the debugger, it must be enabled. In <i>Preferences -> LogixNG</i>, the option
      <i>Install debugger</i> must be enabled.</p>



      <h2>Using the debugger</h2>

      <p>The debugger starts when the ConditionalNG is executed, for example when one of its
      actions or expressions triggers it. The ConditionalNG can also be executed by selecting
      the menu choice <i>Debug -> Execute</i>.</p>

      <p>When the ConditionalNG has started executing, the debugger will stop it before the
      first action. This is shown by a frame around the action where the upper border will be
      thick.</p>

      <p>You can then step by step thru the ConditionalNG by selecting the menu item <i>Debug -> Step into</i>.
      The debugger will then stop both before and after executing/evaluating the action/expression.
      In each case, the action/expression will be marked by a border. When the debugger stops before
      the item, the upper border will be thick. When the debugger stops after the item, the lower border
      will be thick.</b>

      <p>If the item has children, you can jump over the children by selecting the menu item
      <i>Debug -> Step over</i>.</p>

      <p>If you want to run the ConditionalNG instead of stopping on each item, you select the menu item
      <i>Debug -> Run</i>.</p>


      <h2>LogixNG threads and the debugger</h2>

      <p>Then the debugger is stops before or after an action/expression in the ConditionalNG,
      it blocks further execution of both this ConditionalNG and all other
      ConditionalNGs that is executed in the same thread. It's therefore recommended to move
      the ConditionalNG to a separate thread when the debugger is used, so that the debugger
      doesn't block the other ConditionalNGs.</p>

      <p>To change the thread a ConditionalNG is using, <a href="LogixNGTableEditor.shtml">edit</a> the
      LogixNG that the ConditionalNG belongs to and click on the button <i>Edit threads</i> for the
      ConditionalNG. There is a pre created thread, <i>Debug thread</i>, that can be used for this.</p>
