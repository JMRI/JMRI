      <p>The LogixNG Editor table lists all of the currently defined ConditionalNGs.</p>

      </div>

      <dl>
        <dt>System Name</dt>

        <dd>
          The system name for the ConditionalNG. ConditionalNG system names have an
          <strong>IQC</strong> prefix normally followed by numbers. For details about the
          ConditionalNG system name, see <a href="#addConditionalNG">Add a ConditionalNG</a>. The
          system name cannot be changed.
        </dd>

        <dt>User Name</dt>

        <dd>The user name for the ConditionalNG. This is a free form field that contains a
        meaningful name.</dd>

        <dt>Thread</dt>

        <dd>The thread field shows the currently assigned thread name. It is changed by using the
        <strong>Edit threads</strong> button. This is particular useful when using the
        <a href="ConditionalNGDebugger.shtml">LogixNG Debugger</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Startup</dt>

        <dd>Enabled LogixNGs start automatically after the layout configuration has been loaded.
        The resulting actions will depend on the current state of the expressions.  Sometimes a
        LogixNG ConditionalNG should wait until a specific event occurs.  Unchecking the
        <strong>Startup</strong> checkbox will bypass the automatic process.</dd>

        <dt>Edit</dt>

        <dd>The <strong>Edit</strong> button opens the ConditionalNG Editor window.</dd>

        <dt>Debug</dt>

        <dd>The LogixNG Debugger allows you to walk thru a ConditionalNG step by step to see what it
        is actually doing. See <a href="ConditionalNGDebugger.shtml">LogixNG Debugger</a></dd>

        <dt>Delete</dt>

        <dd>
          The <strong>Delete</strong> button deletes the current ConditionalNG and the
          ConditionalNG content. A confirmation dialog will be displayed.
          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <a href="images/DeleteConditionalNG.png"><img src="images/DeleteConditionalNG.png" alt=
            "Delete ConditionalNG Confirmation"></a>
          </div>
        </dd>

        <dt id="EditThreads">Edit threads</dt>

        <dd><p>LogixNG runs the ConditionalNGs in the <strong>LogixNG</strong> Java thread.  This
        reduces conflicts with other parts of JMRI.</p>

        <p>The thread for a ConditionalNG can be changed to use a different thread.  This makes it
        possible to isolate long running or complex ConditionalNGs.  Another use is to use the
        <strong>Debug</strong> thread when using the <strong>Debug</strong> option.  The Debug
        option stops the thread for each step.  By using the Debug thread, the other LogixNG
        ConditionalNGs are not affected.</p>

        <p>When the <strong>Edit threads</strong> button is selected, the Thread editor opens.</p>

        <div style="margin-left: 2em">
          <a href="images/EditThreads.png"><img src="images/EditThreads.png" alt=
          "Edit threads dialog"></a>
        </div>

        <p>The default <strong>LogixNG</strong> and <strong>Debug</strong> threads are displayed.
        The <strong>Add thread button</strong> can be
        used to create new threads.  The threads in the dialog can be used by any ConditionalNG.
        Unused threads can be deleted using the delete button.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Select thread</strong> button is used to assign a different thread to the
        current ConditionalNG.  This is NOT a real time change.  The thread is assigned during
        the layout data file load process.  This means that after a different thread is selected,
        the layout data has to be stored, PanelPro is stopped and restarted and the layout data file
        is loaded.</p>

        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Show startup thread</strong> checkbox</dt>

        <dd>When unchecked, the <strong>Thread</strong> column displays the thread assignments for
        the current PanelPro session.  When checked, the column displays the planned thread
        assignments for the next PanelPro session. If a thread assignment was changed, a layout data
        file <strong>Store</strong> needs to occur before stopping PanelPro.</dd>

      </dl>

      <h2 id="addConditionalNG">Add a ConditionalNG</h2>

      <p>To create a new ConditionalNG, click on the <strong>Add...</strong> button. The
      <strong>Add ConditionalNG</strong> window will be displayed.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/AddConditionalNG.png"><img src="images/AddConditionalNG.png" alt=
        "Add ConditionalNG"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The system name is required. The system name for a ConditionalNG always begins with the
      letters <strong>IQC</strong>. If the entered name does not start with <strong>IQC</strong>,
      it will be automatically added. The typical suffix is a number. If <strong>Automatically
      generate System Name</strong> is checked, the system name format will be
      <strong>IQC:AUTO:nnnn</strong>. Any other format requires adding a <strong>$</strong>
      (dollar) character between <strong>IQC</strong> and the suffix.</p>

      <p class="noted">The ConditionalNG system name is <strong>not</strong> derived from the the
      parent LogixNG system name. This is different than the Logix procedure.</p>

      <p>The user name is optional but recommended. A user name may be any useful text, provided
      the new user name was not previously assigned to another ConditionalNG in
      <strong>this</strong> LogixNG. The user name can be the same as another ConditionalNG that is
      in a different LogixNG.</p>

      <p>Once a ConditionalNG is created, its system name cannot be changed. Its user name may be
      changed in the Edit LogixNG window. The user name is usually used to provide a more
      descriptive name, for example, "Signal 5 Control".</p>

      <p>After clicking <strong>Create</strong>, the ConditionalNG will be created and the <a href=
      "ConditionalNGEditor.shtml">Edit ConditionalNG</a> window will appear.</p>

      <h2 id="buttonReorder">Reorder</h2>

      <p>During initial startup of a LogixNG, the ConditionalNGs will be executed in sequence. The
      sequence for subsequent executions is dependent on JMRI change events.</p>

      <p>When the <strong>Reorder</strong> button is pressed, the <strong>Edit</strong> labels for
      each row will change to <strong>First</strong>. After the first ConditionalNG is selected,
      the label will change to 1 and the remaining labels will change to <strong>Next</strong>. As
      each <strong>Next</strong> is selected, the label will change to the new row number. When all
      of the <strong>Next</strong> labels have been selected, the labels will change back to
      <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>

      <h2 id="buttonExecute">Execute</h2>

      <p>When the <strong>Execute</strong> button is pressed, the ConditionalNG Expressions will be
      evaluated using the current JMRI states and the appropriate Actions will be performed.</p>

      <h2 id="buttonClose">Close</h2>

      <p>When the <strong>Close</strong> button is pressed, the Edit LogixNG window will close.</p>

      <h2 id="buttonDelete">Delete</h2>

      <p>When the <strong>Delete</strong> button is pressed, the LogixNG, its ConditionalNGs and
      related content will be deleted. The LogixNG delete confirmation dialog will be
      displayed.</p>
