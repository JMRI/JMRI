      <p>The LogixNG Editor table lists all of the currently defined ConditionalNGs.</p>

      </div>

      <dl>
        <dt>System Name</dt>

        <dd>
          The system name for the ConditionalNG. ConditionalNG system names have an
          <strong>IQC</strong> prefix normally followed by numbers. For details about the
          ConditionalNG system name, see <a href="#addConditionalNG">Add a ConditionalNG</a>. The
          system name cannot be changed.
        </dd>

        <dt>User Name</dt>

        <dd>The user name for the ConditionalNG. This is a free form field that contains a
        meaningful name.</dd>

        <dt>Thread</dt>

        <dd>The thread field shows the currently assigned thread name. It is changed by using the
        <strong>Edit threads</strong> button. This is particular useful when using the
        <a href="ConditionalNGDebugger.shtml">LogixNG Debugger</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Enabled<span class="since">since 5.7.6</span></dt>

        <dd>When a ConditionalNG is created, it will be <strong>Enabled</strong>.  Uncheck the
        checkbox to disable the ConditionalNG.  One of the options for error handling is to
        disable the ConditionalNG.  After fixing the problem, use the checkbox to enable the
        ConditionalNG.  Sometimes it is helpful to disable a ConditionalNG in order to test
        alternative approaches.</dd>

        <dt>Startup<span class="since">since 5.5.5</span></dt>

        <dd>Enabled LogixNGs start automatically after the layout configuration has been loaded.
        The resulting actions will depend on the current state of the expressions.  Sometimes a
        LogixNG ConditionalNG should wait until a specific event occurs.  Unchecking the
        <strong>Startup</strong> checkbox will bypass the automatic process.</dd>

        <dt>Edit</dt>

        <dd>The <strong>Edit</strong> button opens the ConditionalNG Editor window.</dd>

        <dt>Debug</dt>

        <dd>The LogixNG Debugger allows you to walk thru a ConditionalNG step by step to see what it
        is actually doing. See <a href="ConditionalNGDebugger.shtml">LogixNG Debugger</a></dd>

        <dt>Delete</dt>

        <dd>
          The <strong>Delete</strong> button deletes the current ConditionalNG and the
          ConditionalNG content. A confirmation dialog will be displayed.
          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <a href="images/DeleteConditionalNG.png"><img src="images/DeleteConditionalNG.png" alt=
            "Delete ConditionalNG Confirmation"></a>
          </div>
        </dd>

        <dt id="EditThreads">Edit threads</dt>

        <dd><p>LogixNG runs the ConditionalNGs in the <strong>LogixNG</strong> Java thread.  This
        reduces conflicts with other parts of JMRI.</p>

        <p>The thread for a ConditionalNG can be changed to use a different thread.  This makes it
        possible to isolate long running or complex ConditionalNGs.  Another use is to use the
        <strong>Debug</strong> thread when using the <strong>Debug</strong> option.  The Debug
        option stops the thread for each step.  By using the Debug thread, the other LogixNG
        ConditionalNGs are not affected.</p>

        <p>When the <strong>Edit threads</strong> button is selected, the Thread editor opens.</p>

        <div style="margin-left: 2em">
          <a href="images/EditThreads.png"><img src="images/EditThreads.png" alt=
          "Edit threads dialog"></a>
        </div>

        <p>The default <strong>LogixNG</strong> and <strong>Debug</strong> threads are displayed.
        The <strong>Add thread button</strong> can be
        used to create new threads.  The threads in the dialog can be used by any ConditionalNG.
        Unused threads can be deleted using the delete button.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Select thread</strong> button is used to assign a different thread to the
        current ConditionalNG.  This is NOT a real time change.  The thread is assigned during
        the layout data file load process.  This means that after a different thread is selected,
        the layout data has to be stored, PanelPro is stopped and restarted and the layout data file
        is loaded.</p>

        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Show startup thread</strong> checkbox</dt>

        <dd>When unchecked, the <strong>Thread</strong> column displays the thread assignments for
        the current PanelPro session.  When checked, the column displays the planned thread
        assignments for the next PanelPro session. If a thread assignment was changed, a layout data
        file <strong>Store</strong> needs to occur before stopping PanelPro.</dd>

      </dl>

      <h2 id="addConditionalNG">Add a ConditionalNG</h2>

      <p>To create a new ConditionalNG, click on the <strong>Add...</strong> button. The
      <strong>Add ConditionalNG</strong> window will be displayed.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/AddConditionalNG.png"><img src="images/AddConditionalNG.png" alt=
        "Add ConditionalNG"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The system name is required. The system name for a ConditionalNG always begins with the
      letters <strong>IQC</strong>. If the entered name does not start with <strong>IQC</strong>,
      it will be automatically added. The typical suffix is a number. If <strong>Automatically
      generate System Name</strong> is checked, the system name format will be
      <strong>IQC:AUTO:nnnn</strong>. Any other format requires adding a <strong>$</strong>
      (dollar) character between <strong>IQC</strong> and the suffix.</p>

      <p class="noted">The ConditionalNG system name is <strong>not</strong> derived from the the
      parent LogixNG system name. This is different than the Logix procedure.</p>

      <p>The user name is optional but recommended. A user name may be any useful text, provided
      the new user name was not previously assigned to another ConditionalNG in
      <strong>this</strong> LogixNG. The user name can be the same as another ConditionalNG that is
      in a different LogixNG.</p>

      <p>Once a ConditionalNG is created, its system name cannot be changed. Its user name may be
      changed in the Edit LogixNG window. The user name is usually used to provide a more
      descriptive name, for example, "Signal 5 Control".</p>

      <p>After clicking <strong>Create</strong>, the ConditionalNG will be created and the <a href=
      "ConditionalNGEditor.shtml">Edit ConditionalNG</a> window will appear.</p>

      <h2 id="buttonReorder">Reorder</h2>

      <p>During initial startup of a LogixNG, the ConditionalNGs will be executed in sequence. The
      sequence for subsequent executions is dependent on JMRI change events.</p>

      <p>When the <strong>Reorder</strong> button is pressed, the <strong>Edit</strong> labels for
      each row will change to <strong>First</strong>. After the first ConditionalNG is selected,
      the label will change to 1 and the remaining labels will change to <strong>Next</strong>. As
      each <strong>Next</strong> is selected, the label will change to the new row number. When all
      of the <strong>Next</strong> labels have been selected, the labels will change back to
      <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>

      <h2 id="buttonExecute">Execute</h2>

      <p>When the <strong>Execute</strong> button is pressed, the ConditionalNG Expressions will be
      evaluated using the current JMRI states and the appropriate Actions will be performed.</p>

      <h2 id="buttonClose">Close</h2>

      <p>When the <strong>Close</strong> button is pressed, the Edit LogixNG window will close.</p>

      <h2 id="buttonDelete">Delete</h2>

      <p>When the <strong>Delete</strong> button is pressed, the LogixNG, its ConditionalNGs and
      related content will be deleted. The LogixNG delete confirmation dialog will be
      displayed.</p>
