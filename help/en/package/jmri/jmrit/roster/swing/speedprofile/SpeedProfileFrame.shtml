      <h1>Roster Speed Profiling</h1>

      <p>The tool is designed to create a profile of a loco at
      various speed steps to help with the automatic running of a
      loco within JMRI. Primarily to help with the principle of
      getting a loco to stop within a specific distance from a
      known throttle setting.</p>

      <p>The tool works on the principle of timing a loco over a
      known distance at a given speed step, in both the forward and
      reverse direction. Currently it requires three sensors which
      monitor the occupancy of a section of track. Ideally the
      section of track that the timed runs are performed over
      should be straight, and a minimum of 1mtr long, the longer
      the length the better the result. For this profiling to work
      correctly acceleration/deacceleration should be disabled on
      the loco decoder.</p><b>Requirements</b>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Block Length</b> - This is the length in Millimetres
        of the middle section which the timed run will be
        measured.</li>

        <li><b>Start Sensor</b> - This is the initial section of
        track that the loco will start its initial run from.</li>

        <li><b>Block Sensor</b> - This is the sensor related to the
        section of track that the timed run will be taken over</li>

        <li><b>Finish Sensor</b> - This sensor related to the
        section track immediately after the timed section.</li>

        <li><b>Roster Entry</b> - Select the loco that the
        profiling is to be performed on.</li>

        <li><b>Cancel</b> - Cancels the profiling or test run</li>

        <li><b>Profile</b> - Starts the profiling</li>

        <li><b>View</b> - Opens a table of the speed profile</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To profile the loco, fill the above details into the
      window, place the loco in the starting section facing
      forwards towards (but not on) the section of track that the
      timed run will be taken over, then press profile.</p>

      <p>What happens is that the tool will set the loco off
      running in the forward direction at speed step 1, when it
      activates the timed section sensor it starts a timer. Once
      the finish section sensor is activated the timer is stopped,
      and the speed is calculated in Millimetres per Second, this
      is then recorded against the roster. The tool will then
      ensure that the loco is clear of the timed section sensor,
      then repeat the procedure again but in the reverse direction.
      Once the loco is back at the initial start section, the whole
      procedure is repeated again for the next speed step, this
      occurs until a profile of all speed steps has been
      completed.</p>

      <p>Profiles can be made with fewer speed steps by choosing
      the steps to start and end on, and how many steps to
      increment to the next sampling step. When a starting step is
      larger than 4 be sure to place the loco in a position that
      will allow it to achieve full speed before reaching the block
      sensor.</p>

      <p>The "Update Profile" radio button (default) merges
      whatever profiling has been done with the existing speed
      profile in the Roster. The "Clear Profile" radio button
      overwrites any existing speed profile.</p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>Having completed the profiling, it is
      possible to test the profile out. Place the loco in the
      starting section again facing forward toward the timed
      section, ideally some distance away from it. Enter in a
      starting speed step number in the box next to the Test
      Button, then press test. What will occur is that the tool
      will set the loco off running at the given speed step, then
      it will attempt to gradually stop the loco before it reaches
      the far end. Results will vary especially at the higher speed
      steps, where you will more likely experience an over run.</p>

      <h3>Viewing</h3>
      <p>The table displayed by the View button shows
      the speeds attained by the loco for each throttle step in
      both directions. The default speeds are in millimeters per
      second of the layout track speed. These values can be
      converted to scale speeds by selecting either of the "Miles
      per Hour" or "Kilometers per Hour" radio buttons on the
      Warrants panel of Preferences. The Factor column is the ratio
      of track speed (mm/sec) to throttle setting (0.0 to 1.0).</p>
