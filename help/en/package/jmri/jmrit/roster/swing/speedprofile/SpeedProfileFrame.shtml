      <h1>Roster Speed Profiling</h1>

      <p>The Speed Profiling tool is designed to create a profile
      of a loco at various speed steps to help with the automatic
      running of a loco within JMRI using either
      <a href="../../../dispatcher/NewTrain.shtml">DispatcherPro</a>
      or <a href="../../../logix/SpeedChanges.shtml">Warrants</a>.<br>
      Primary goal is to help getting a loco to
      stop within a specific distance using a known Throttle setting.
      </p>

      <p>The tool is accessed through the Roster -&gt; Speed Profiling
      menu item.<br>
      It works on the principle of timing a loco over a
      known distance at a given speed step, in both the forward and
      reverse direction. Currently it requires three sensors which
      monitor the occupancy around a section of track. Ideally the
      section of track that the timed runs are performed over
      should be straight, and a minimum of 1 Meter long; the longer
      the length the better the result. For this profiling to work
      correctly, acceleration/deacceleration should be disabled in
      the loco decoder.</p>

      <h3>Settings</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Block Length</b> - This is the length in Millimeters
        of the middle section which the timed run will be
        measured.</li>

        <li><b>Start Sensor</b> - This is the initial section of
        track that the loco will start its initial run from.</li>

        <li><b>Block Sensor</b> - This is the sensor related to the
        section of track that the timed run will be taken over</li>

        <li><b>Finish Sensor</b> - This sensor related to the
        section track immediately after the timed section.</li>

        <li><b>Roster Entry</b> - Select the loco that the
        profiling is to be performed on.</li>

        <li><b>Start</b> - Starts the profiling</li>

        <li><b>Test</b> - Test the existing Speed Profile (see below)</li>

        <li><b>Cancel</b> - Cancels a profiling or test run</li>

        <li><b>View</b> - Opens a table of the speed profile</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To profile the loco, fill the above details into the
      pane, place the loco in the starting section facing
      forwards towards (but not <i>on</i>) the track Block that the
      timed run will be taken over, then press [Start].</p>

      height="89" alt="Speed Profiling Setup">

      <p>What happens is that the tool will set the loco off
      running in the forward direction at speed step 1, when it
      activates the timed section sensor it starts a timer. Once
      the finish section sensor is activated the timer is stopped,
      and the speed is calculated in Millimetres per Second, this
      is then recorded against the roster. The tool will then
      ensure that the loco is clear of the timed section sensor,
      then repeat the procedure again but in the reverse direction.
      Once the loco is back at the initial start section, the whole
      procedure is repeated again for the next speed step, this
      occurs until a profile of all speed steps has been
      completed.</p>

      <p>Profiles can be made with fewer speed steps by choosing
      the steps to start and end on, and how many steps to
      increment to the next sampling step. When a starting step is
      larger than 4 be sure to place the loco in a position that
      will allow it to achieve full speed before reaching the block
      sensor.</p>

      <p>The "Save Merged" button combines and saves whatever profiling
      has been done with the existing speed profile in the Roster.<br>
      The "Save New" button overwrites any existing speed profile.<br>
      The "Clear New Data" button disards the most recent results,
      allowing you to test after a less successful try.<br>
      Click "Delete Current Profile" to remove any Speed Profile
      from the Roster entry.<br>
      "Save Sensors" is handy to store newly added Sensors to your
      configuration file.
      </p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>Having completed the profiling, it is possible to test
      a Profile. Place the loco in the starting Block again,
      facing forward toward the timed Block, ideally some distance
      away from it. Enter a starting speed number in the Test Data
      - Step box, then press [Test].<br>
      What will occur is that the tool will set the loco off
      running at the given speed step over the Test Block, stop
      and reverse at the same Step. Measured speed will be reported
      in the Forward and Reverse boxes.<br>
      Results will vary especially at the higher speed steps,
      where you will more likely experience an over run.</p>

      <h3>Viewing</h3>
      <p>Click one of the buttons in the View area to open a table
      showing the profile values for either the New Profiling results,
      Current stored in the Roster or a combination
      of both. Cells in the table contain the speeds attained
      by the loco for each throttle step in both directions.<br>
      The default speeds are in millimeters per
      second as measured layout track speed. These values can be
      converted to scale speeds by selecting either of the
      "Miles/hr" or "Kilometers/hr" (per Hour) radio buttons over
      the table.<br>
      The Factor column is the ratio of track speed (mm/sec) to
      throttle setting (from 0.0 to 1.0).<br>
      In the example (using simulated timings) cells with unexpected
      (non-incrementing) values are marked in red. Such cells are
      editable to correct the value or the whole row for that step
      can be deleted. Normally the red instruction will not display.
