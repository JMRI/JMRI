      <h1>The Icon Editors</h1>

      <h2>Contents of the Icon Editors</h2><img src="images/AddPanel.png"
      align="right">

      <p>Five of the Icon Editors: (Right Hand Turnout, Left Hand
      Turnout, Sensor, Signal, MultiSensor) display a group of
      icons above a table. The table lists all of the JMRI entities
      of the given type that have been defined. There is one icon
      for each state the entity can have. The icons shown are the
      default icons, but you may change them.</p>

      <p>Below the table are two buttons, <b>Add to Panel</b> and
      <b>Change Icon...</b>. The <b>Add to Panel button</b> is
      inactive until a device is selected from the table. Then it
      becomes active, and when pressed will install the set of
      icons into the panel. Pressing the <b>Change Icon</b> button
      is discussed below.</p>

      <p>Two other Icon Editors: (Memory Value and Reporter Value)
      have no icons and no <b>Change Icon</b> button, but do have
      tables and an <b>Add to Panel</b> button. You must select an
      entity from the table before the <b>Add to Panel</b> button
      becomes active. No icons are displayed for these JMRI
      entities because pressing <b>Add to Panel</b> installs the
      value maintained by the entity into the Panel.</p>

      <p>Another two Icon Editors: (Background Image and Icon
      (plain)) display a default icon, but no table, since these
      elements do not represent a JMRI device. For these elements
      the <b>Add to Panel</b> button is always active.</p>

      <p>The remaining two choices for icons: (RPS Reporter and
      Fast Clock) install their icons directly into the Panel.</p>

      <h3>Adding JMRI Entities to the Panel</h3>

      <p>As mentioned above selecting an entity from the table
      makes the <b>Add to Panel</b> button active. Pressing this
      button installs the icons for the entity into the Panel.</p>

      <p>If a text field appears below the <b>Add to Panel</b>
      button it may be used to enter a new entity into the table.
      When a System Name is entered into this text field, the
      entity is entity is created, its name entered into the table,
      and the <b>Add to Panel</b> button becomes active. Pressing
      the button installs the icons for the new entity into the
      Panel.</p>

      <h2>Pressing the Change Icon Button</h2><img src=
      "images/AddPanel2.png" align="right">

      <p>Pressing this button will add a pane labeled
      <b>Catalog</b> to the window. It will show one or more
      "trees" in a scrollable panel. Expanding the tree displays
      "nodes" or branches of the tree that in turn can be expanded.
      The nodes correspond to things that are file system
      directories or are similar to file system directories.
      Whenever image (icon) files are encountered in a node, the
      images are displayed in a pane below the Catalog tree(s).</p>

      <p>This pane is a "Preview" panel of the contents of the node
      and has a label that states how many image files have been
      found. The panel display all the images that it has found in
      the node. Beneath each image (icon) is a label that states
      the "scale" at which the image is displayed. "Scale 1:1"
      indicates the icon is displayed at full size. If a large
      image file had been found, the scale might be 0.25:1 to
      indicate that the display is 1/4 the actual size of the image
      that could be transferred to the Panel.<br>
      <span class="since">since 4.9.7</span>Below the icons is a
      "View On:" combo box that allows you to choose the background to
      the icons. This may help in determining what parts of the icon
      are opaque and what parts are transparent. Initially, the current
      Panel background color is used.</p>

      <p>The Catalog pane will always display at least one tree
      titled "Program Directory". This is the resource directory
      from the jmri.jar that was built when you installed this
      current version of JMRI. Other trees that you might see are:
      "pPreferences Directory", if you have created a "resources"
      directory within your JMRI preferences directory - or
      possibly see, "Image Index" if it has been created already
      (see below for more information).</p>

      <h3>Changing the Icon</h3>

      <p>Most Icon Editor operations are done by "Drag and Drop".
      To change an icon, drag any icon from the node display pane
      at the bottom of the window (i.e. press down on the mouse
      button and hold it down while moving the mouse) to any of the
      JMRI entity icons at the top of the Icon Editor. Release the
      mouse button after hovering over the icon you want to change
      and the dragged icon will replace it. You may go to other
      nodes and drag any of icons found there until you are
      satisfied with the state icons you want to install into the
      Panel.</p>

      <p>The changes you make to the icons of a JMRI entity can be
      saved and recalled the next time you use PanelPro by using
      the menu item <b>Store Image Index</b> in the <b>File</b>
      menu of the Panel Editor. The <b>Store Image Index</b> menu
      item also appears in the <b>File</b> menu of the Image Index
      Editor.</p>

      <h2>Icon Editor Menus</h2>

      <p>The <b>Find Icons</b> menu has the following items:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Create/Create/Edit Image Index</b>. This menu item
        opens a window where you can organize the icons into a
        scheme that makes them easy to find when you want to use an
        Icon Editor. See the <a href=
        "../catalog/ImageIndex.shtml">Image Index Editor page</a>
        for how this menu item is used.</li>

        <li>
          <b>Search File System for Icons</b>. This opens a file
          chooser dialog where you may open any directory that that
          has image files. Select any directory seen by your
          computer and a search for icons will begin. This will
          visit every directory under this directory and when it
          encounters one with image files, it will open a window
          and attempt to display all the images it finds there.
          Note: <i>This may take some time.</i>

          <p>Depending on how much memory is needed to show all the
          files, one of the following two sequences of events will
          occur.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If there sufficient memory to display the files,
            the window will show them along with the radio buttons
            to adjust their background. Also, three buttons will be
            displayed above the images - <b>Add to Catalog</b>, <b>
              Continue Searching</b> and <b>Cancel</b>.

              <ul>
                <li>Pressing <b>Add to Catalog</b> will make this
                directory one of the trees in the Catalog pane. In
                this case, you may then use it to select icons to
                change icons in any of the Icon Editors.</li>

                <li>Pressing <b>Continue Searching</b> will have
                the search proceed to the next directory found with
                image files.</li>

                <li>Pressing <b>Cancel</b> will close the window
                with no further action.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>If there is not enough memory to display all the
            image files found in the directory, a message will
            state how many files can be displayed. Press <b>OK</b>
            and most likely another message will be posted
            explaining that if you want to add any of these images
            to the Catalog you should move or copy the ones you
            want to another directory. Again press <b>OK</b> and
            the window will display what it can. In this case, the
            three buttons are <b>Show More</b>, <b>Continue
            Searching</b> and <b>Cancel</b>.

              <ul>
                <li>Pressing <b>Show More</b> will display the next
                group of image files from the directory that it is
                able to display.</li>

                <li>Pressing <b>Continue Searching</b> will have
                the search proceed to the next directory found with
                image files.</li>

                <li>Pressing <b>Cancel</b> will close the window
                with no further action.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Note the latter case generally occurs when you
              open a sizable photo album directory.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>This is a feature to be used sparingly, but many
          interesting icons can be found, particularly those cached
          by your browser. You might have a use for them.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Making New Icons Available to the Panel</h3>

      <p>You can also create your own icons. There are two ways you
      can make these permanently available to the Panel Editor.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create an Image Index Catalog that is saved to disk and
        will appear automatically in the Catalog pane. Use the
        <b>Create/Edit an ImageIndex Catalog</b> menu item to
        create and edit an ImageIndex. The ImageIndex will be
        preserved unchanged during an upgrade. See the <a href=
        "../catalog/ImageIndex.shtml">Image Index Editor page</a>
        for more detail.</li>

        <li>Create a new folder named "resources" in your JMRI
        Preferences directory. Add your new icons to that folder.
        This will prevent any possible conflicts or loss of data
        during an upgrade. These new items will automatically
        appear under "Preferences Directory" in the icon
        Catalog.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Changing the Default Icons</h3>

      <p>The icons displayed when you first open an Icon Editor are
      the default icons. You may change these defaults by storing
      icons of your choice to be the default icons for each Icon
      Editor.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>After you have modified the icons by dragging icons
        from the "catalog pane" and dropping them on the default
        icons, use the "Store Image Index" menu item under the
        "File" menu on the Panel Editor window.</li>

        <li>Alternatively, if you close the Icon Editor you will be
        prompted with a dialog asking if you want to Save these
        icon choices as your defaults. This dialog is also
        displayed if changes have been made to the Image Index. The
        dialog presents three options:

          <ul>
            <li><b>Yes</b> - Save any changes that have been made
            to the default icons or Image Index.</li>

            <li><b>No</b> - And don't show any more prompts about
            changes.</li>

            <li><b>Cancel</b> - Not right now, but prompt me
            later.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
