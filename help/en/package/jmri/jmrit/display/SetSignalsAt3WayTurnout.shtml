      <h1>Set Signals at 3-Way Turnout</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>In Layout Editor a 3-way turnout is modeled by using two
      turnouts, usually one right-hand and one left-hand, oriented
      so that the throat of the second turnout is connected to the
      continuing track of the first turnout by a very short Track
      Segment. This tool provides an automated procedure for
      assigning signal heads and automatically creating signal
      logic for a 3-way turnout modeled in this way. This tool can
      also be used to place signals and set logic for two real
      turnouts that are oriented as described above, where the user
      does not want to put signals between the two
      turnouts--essentially two real left-handed or right-handed
      turnouts that simulate a real 3-way turnout.</p>

      <p>Six signal heads may be placed around the 3-way turnout as
      shown below:</p><a href="./images/DoubleXover8.gif"><img src=
      "images/3_WayTurnout.jpg" width="469" height="180"
      hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>

      <p>The turnout at the throat, is referred to as <b>Turnout
      A</b> and the other turnout is <b>Turnout B</b>. Six signal
      heads are possible--three at the throat, indicating the
      status of the Continuing track (top signal head), Diverging
      track A (middle signal head), and Diverging track B (bottom
      signal head), and one head at each of the three other
      tracks.</p>

      <p>If requested, this tool will place signal icons on the
      panel at the six positions shown above and will set up
      control logic for each of the six specified signal heads. In
      some situations, a user may elect to only place one signal
      head at the throat, resulting in only four signal heads
      around the 3-way turnout. This tool will place the four
      specified heads, and will set up logic for the heads at the
      Diverging A, Diverging B, and Continuing tracks, but it
      cannot set up logic for the single head at the throat.
      Instructions on how to do that manually, with help from this
      tool are below.</p>

      <p>Prior to selecting this tool, both turnouts must be on the
      panel, connected as shown by a single track segment, and
      required signal heads must be in the Signal Head Table. This
      tool places signal heads only when the main track of each
      turnout is vertical or horizontal (or mostly vertical or
      horizontal) on the panel, so design your panel accordingly.
      The control logic created by this tool only works correctly
      if each of the three track segments connected to the
      continuing and two diverging legs of the 3-way turnout is
      assigned to a different block, and those blocks are different
      from the block of the track segment connected to the throat
      of the 3-way turnout. The 3-way turnout (the two turnouts and
      their connecting short track segment) may be in a separate
      block or in the same block as the track segment connected to
      the throat.</p>

      <p>When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of
      the names (system or user) of the two turnouts, and the names
      (system or user) of six (or four) signal heads to be assigned
      to the 3-way turnout. You may enter both turnout names, or
      enter only one turnout and allow the program to find the
      other. If you enter only one turnout, make sure you put it in
      the correct position. To check that the second turnout has
      been found correctly, click the <b>Get Saved</b> button.</p>

      <p>For each signal head, check boxes are available for
      selecting whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and
      whether control logic is to be created for the signal head.
      Regardless of whether icons are placed or logic is created,
      Layout Editor will record that the entered signal heads are
      assigned to the specified turnouts. <b>Assigning signal heads
      to turnouts is important to completely describe your layout
      in Layout Editor.</b> Even if you elect to place your icons
      and set up your signal logic manually, you should use this
      tool to assign the signal heads to their 3-way turnout.</p>

      <p>After a 3-way turnout is setup using this set up tool,
      Layout Editor keeps track of the fact that Turnout A and
      Turnout B are linked. So if you select <b>Set Signals...</b>
      in the popup menu of either turnout, you will return to this
      dialog with both turnouts filled in. If you should later
      desire to 'unlink' the two turnouts and add the missing
      signals, for each of the turnouts, select <b>Set Signals at
      Turnout...</b>, fill in the turnout name manually, enter
      signal heads, and click <b>Done</b>. After this is done for
      both turnouts, the turnouts will no longer be linked.</p>

      <h3>The Set Signals at 3-Way Turnout Dialog</h3>

      <p>In the <b>Turnout A Name</b> and <b>Turnout B Name</b>
      field, enter the name (system or user) of one or two of the
      turnouts. If only one is entered, the tool will find the
      other when the <b>Done</b> or <b>Get Saved</b> buttons are
      clicked. If the tool cannot find the second turnout, or if
      the two entered turnouts are not on the panel or not
      connected as described above by a single track segment, an
      error message results. The turnout at the throat of the 3-way
      turnout must be entered as Turnout A, and the turnout
      farthest from the throat must be entered as Turnout B.</p>

      <p>Signal Head names (either system or user) are entered in
      the next section. If signal heads at these turnouts have been
      entered previously, click <b>Get Saved</b> to retrieve the
      signal head names previously entered. The tool provides for
      entry of three signals at the throat and one each at the
      other three tracks. The throat signal heads and the Diverging
      A signal head are placed in Turnout A. The Diverging B and
      Continuing signal heads are placed in Turnout B. The Throat
      Continuing signal head (green in the above figure) reflects
      travel to the continuing track from the throat track. The
      other two throat signals reflect travel to their respective
      diverging tracks. If only one throat signal is entered, it
      should be entered in the Throat Continuing position.</p>

      <p>If there was a signal head previously assigned to any
      position, and you enter a <i>different</i> signal head in the
      same place, the new signal head will replace the previous
      signal head, and the icon of the previous signal head (if
      there was one) will be deleted from the panel. Similarly, if
      you replace both previously assigned <b>Throat Diverging</b>
      signal heads with blank entries (no signal heads), the
      previous entries are deleted, and there will not be any
      signal heads at those positions. <b>If a signal head is
      changed, you must redo any logic that involves it.</b></p>

      <p>Check <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> to request that an
      icon for a signal head be placed on the panel at the turnout
      position indicated. This tool can only place a signal icon on
      turnouts that are almost vertical or almost horizontal. If
      this is not so, a message is printed, and you should place
      the signal icon manually using the Layout Editor tool bar.
      Regardless, the signal head name is assigned to the specified
      turnout position. This assignment is important for setting up
      logic for other signals down the track. Assigning signal
      heads is also important in completely describing your layout
      in Layout Editor.</p>

      <p>Check <b>Set up Logic</b> to request that the tool set up
      signal control logic for a signal head. For each of these
      signal heads, the tool creates a Simple Signal Logic for that
      head, and in addition where necessary, it creates a Logix
      that ensures that the turnouts are synchronized for the
      signal. The tool will attempt to setup the logic and
      automatically fill in entries from the information available.
      If the tool does not have enough information available to set
      up the logic, a message results, and you will have to return
      later after more blocks (with occupancy sensors) and/or
      signals have been assigned to turnouts and block boundaries
      on the panel. <b>Note: This tool cannot currently set up
      logic for a single head at the throat of a 3-way turnout. See
      below for how to do so manually</b>.</p>

      <h3>Notes</h3>

      <p>This tool will set up Simple Signal Logic in a
      standardized manner that should cover most cases. If the
      signals do not behave the way you want them to, feel free to
      edit the Simple Signal Logic manually to get the performance
      you want. To edit the simple signal logic for a signal head,
      in Edit Mode, summon the popup menu of the icon for the
      signal head whose logic is to be edited, and select <b>Edit
      Logic...</b>. Usually addition or removal of a sensor, or
      checking or unchecking an option, is all that is required. In
      more complicated cases, you may need to create a Logix to set
      the state of an internal sensor, that is then added to the
      Simple Signal Logic.</p>

      <p>When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within
      a block until it finds a signal at the end of the block away
      from the turnout being signaled. If your layout contains
      sections that are signaled and sections that are not, to get
      this tool to set up logic correctly, you may have to create
      and assign a virtual signal (a signal that does not
      correspond to an actual signal on the layout) at the
      unsignaled end of the block that connects track that is
      signaled with track that is not signaled. (You do not need to
      add an icon for the virtual signal to your panel, but it must
      exist in your signal head table, and must be assigned to a
      turnout or block boundary using a Set Signals ... tool.) If a
      block ends with an end bumper, no virtual signal is required
      at the end bumper end.</p>

      <p>If a block has an internal turnout (the turnout, and the
      track segments at its throat and continuing legs are within
      the block), the program will expect signals at that turnout
      even if it's not at the end of the block. However, at times
      the user may not want to signal a seldom used turnout within
      a block. When following track through a block, the program
      will skip over unsignaled internal turnouts if <b>Skip
      Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</b> is checked in the Layout
      Editor <b>Tools</b> menu. It will always, however, warn that
      it is doing so. <b>Use this option with caution.</b> There is
      no signal protecting against a skipped turnout being set
      incorrectly, so if an unsignaled internal turnout is not set
      correctly, derailed trains could result.</p>

      <p>When setting up the Logix used in the control logic, the
      tool creates an internal sensor to communicate with the
      Simple Signal Logic. The Logix will appear in your Logix
      table, and the internal sensor will appear in your sensor
      table. The system names of the Logix and internal sensor will
      be, IX or IS followed by TTT_X_HHH, where TTT is the system
      name of the turnout where the signal head is located, X is
      either C or T depending on whether the signal head is located
      on the continuing (CLOSED) track or the diverging (THROWN)
      track, and HHH is the system name of the signal head. The
      purpose of this Logix is to ensure that the aspect of the
      signal head will be red if the turnout not in the Simple
      Signal Logic is switched against the track the signal head is
      signaling.</p>

      <p>This tool sets up three-aspect signaling. When a signal
      head is showing status when moving to a diverging route, the
      tool will set up for limited speed (the least restrictive
      aspect is not green, but yellow), and the signal will show
      yellow when it otherwise would show green. You can change
      this with a simple edit (see below).</p>

      <p>If you have a special situation at a signal, you may have
      to edit the information entered by this tool into the Simple
      Signal Logic. If you would like four-aspect signaling, you
      can easily manually edit the logic to achieve this.
      Similarly, by simple hand edits of the logic, you can add
      approach lighting. If you don't want yellow when moving to a
      diverging route, but prefer green, open the Simple Signal
      Logic for the head you want to change and uncheck <b>Limited
      Speed</b>. The Simple Signal Logic dialog can be accessed
      from the popup menu of each signal icon. If your special
      situation cannot be handled by Simple Signal Logic, you
      should refer to Logix to tailor the signal logic to your
      needs.</p>

      <h3>Logic for a Single Head at the Throat</h3>

      <p>There are different ways to set up the logic for a single
      head at the throat of a 3-way turnout. The following
      procedure will work, and is fairly straightforward.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Define three virtual signal heads in the Signal Table,
          and enter them as the <b>Throat - Continuing</b>,
          <b>Throat - Diverging A</b>, and <b>Throat - Diverging
          B</b> heads, along with the real <b>Diverging A</b>,
          <b>Continuing</b>, and <b>Diverging B</b> signal heads.
          Virtual signal heads are signal heads that are not on the
          layout--only in the computer.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Set up Logic</b> for each of the virtual
          signal heads, but do not check <b>Add Signal Icon to
          Panel</b> for any of these three virtual signal heads.
          Click <b>Done</b>. This will set up the logic for the
          three virtual signal heads.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Reopen the tool and clear the names of the three
          virtual signal heads. Place the real throat signal
          head in the <b>Throat - Continuing</b> position. Check
          <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b>, but do not check <b>Set
          up Logic</b> for this signal head. Click <b>Done</b>. The
          three virtual turnouts are no longer assigned to the
          3-way turnout, but they are still in the computer and
          their logic will still function.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Set up a Logix to set the appearance of the single
          real throat signal head based on the appearances of the
          three virtual signal heads. Basically the real signal
          head should be set to the least restrictive of the
          appearances of the three virtual signal heads. This can
          be accomplished by a Logix with seven Conditionals with
          increasing numbers of simple state variables, set up as
          follows:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Conditional 1: if Signal Green IHV1, then Set
            Signal Appearance IH1 Green</li>

            <li>Conditional 2: if Conditional False C1 AND Signal
            Green IHV2, then Set Signal Appearance IH1 Green</li>

            <li>Conditional 3: if Conditional False C1 AND
            Conditional False C2 AND Signal Green IHV3, then Set
            Signal Appearance IH1 Green</li>

            <li>Conditional 4: if Conditional False C1 AND
            Conditional False C2 AND Conditional False C3 AND
            Signal Yellow IHV1, then Set Signal Appearance IH1
            Yellow</li>

            <li>Conditional 5: if Conditional False C1 AND
            Conditional False C2 AND Conditional False C3 AND
            Conditional False C4 AND Signal Yellow IHV2, then Set
            Signal Appearance IH1 Yellow</li>

            <li>Conditional 6: if Conditional False C1 AND
            Conditional False C2 AND Conditional False C3 AND
            Conditional False C4 AND Conditional False C5 AND
            Signal Yellow IHV3, then Set Signal Appearance IH1
            Yellow</li>

            <li>Conditional 7: if Conditional False C1 AND
            Conditional False C2 AND Conditional False C3 AND
            Conditional False C4 AND Conditional False C5 AND
            Conditional False C6, then Set Signal Appearance IH1
            Red</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Where IHV1, IHV2, and IHV3 are the virtual signal
          heads, IH1 is the real head, and C1, C2, ... , C7 are
          Conditionals 1 through 7. Substitute the actual names of
          these items when you set up your Logix.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Please remember to save your panel after using this
      tool.</b></p>
