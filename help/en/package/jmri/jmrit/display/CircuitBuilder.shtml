    <h1>Circuit Builder</h1>

    <p><span class="since">Since 2.12</span><br>
    The <b>Circuit Builder</b> is a view of a <b>Control Panel Editor</b>
    panel. It is an alternative to using the
    <a href="../logix/OBlockTable.shtml">Occupancy Block Tables</a> to create 
    <b>OBlocks, Portals and OPaths</b>.
    Circuit Builder is a graphical tool to create and configure these objects
    by "point and click" mouse operations. Here "track circuit" is just another name
    for "OBlock". The
    prototype name for track having a device that can detect occupancy is
    <b>Track Circuit</b>.  In JMRI we have used the term <i>"Block"</i> and
    <i>"OBlock"</i> to refer to what in the prototype world is a track circuit.
    The term <b>Block</b> in the prototype world is <i>a length of track defined
    by limits, whose use is governed by block signals, cab signals or block limit
    markers and train orders.</i>  That is, a prototype block incorporates a
    signaling system providing a way to manage safe usage of its trackage.  So
    to model a prototype block, several track circuits may be needed.
    The term <b>track circuit</b> here in JMRI is just an attempt to get a little closer to
    prototype usage, but it is just another name for <b>OBlock</b> and the stuff 
    (<b>Portals</b> and <b>OPaths</b>) that gets it to act a little more like a
    prototype "Block".  Creating track circuits, that is, making and configuring
    OBlocks, Portals and OPaths enables the creation and running of <b>Warrants</b>.
    </p><p>
    <span class="since">Since 4.17.3</span><br>
    Circuit Builder also configures
    Signal Masts or Signal Head at Portals to display aspects and appearances that
    indicate track conditions on your layout. These signals then can modify warrants
    during their runtime to respond to track conditions.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    The Circuit Builder tool can be opened from either the <b>Circuit Builder</b>
    menu item under the <b>Add Items</b> menu or by the <b>Open Circuit Builder</b>
    menu item under the <b>Warrant</b> menu.
    <p>
	Make a track diagram of your layout using track icons - of any kind, but
	eventually they will need to be some kind of Indicator Track. The 
	<b>Item Palette</b> menu item under the <b>Add Items</b> menu
	can help you select the kind you want. Then open
	CircuitBuilder as suggested above. The CircuitBuilder menu
	will appear. Now use either the Circuit Builder window or the
	Circuit Builder menu to make two track circuits (OBlocks).<br>
	<a href="#OBlocks">Add/Edit OBlocks</a><br>
	After making two OBlocks you can make and configure the following items:<br>
	<a href="#Portals">Add/Edit Portals</a><br>
	<a href="#OPaths">Add/Edit Paths</a><br>
	<a href="#DirectionArrows">Edit Portal direction Arrows</a><br>
	<a href="#Signals">Add/Edit Signals</a><br>
	When you are done editing, select the items under the <a href="#Errors">Error Checks</a> 
	submenu for errors and omissions.<br>
	</p>
	    
    <h2>Basic Operational Model of Circuit Builder</h2>
    Circuit Builder works by using icons on a block by block basis. 
    OBlocks, Portals and OPaths are created and linked by "point and click" on the
    icons of your layout diagram.  The element types (OBlock, Portal,
    OPath, Signal) are created and edited using various editing modes of the tool.
    In short, it works as follows:
    <p>
    First create an OBlock by selecting track icons. Then create Portals by dragging 
    an icon that overlaps two OBlocks. Then create OPaths by selecting the portal icons
    and track icons that indicate the path. Finally perhaps add a signal to protect an
    OBlock by selecting the portal of the approach. The result
    of this editing transforms the track in your layout panels to indicator trackage
    displaying the states of the blocks and their paths by color without altering the
    original look of the panel. These operations are done from the CircuitBuilder menu
    items and are detailed below.
    </p><p>
    Panel files previously made with Panel Editor
    can be used with Circuit Builder as long as they can be loaded into this
    version of JMRI.  Circuit Builder upgrades plain track icons to
    Indicator Track icons.  See <a href="ItemPalette.shtml">The Item Palette</a>
    for more information about Indicator track icons.
    </p><p>
    CircuitBuilder is aware of all the objects defined in the Occupancy Block tables. 
    When your layout track diagram is split up among several panels, each panel has a 
    its own CircuitBuilder to edit its icons. It may post messages about missing icons but if the objects
    are not meant to be represented on that panel, ignore them. This "discrepancy" is due
    to the fact that OBlocks, Portals and Paths are global for all panels of your JMRI
    session, but each Circuit Builder is concerned only by the icons on its panel.
    </p>

    <h3>Mouse Operations When Using CircuitBuilder</h3>
    When in an editing mode of
    Circuit Builder, the mouse click conventions differ somewhat from those of the panel editors.
    When a Circuit Builder menu item is selected an editing window is opened and the panel is in
    a Circuit Builder editing mode. Note the following when in a Circuit Builder editing mode:
    <ul>
        <li>Dragging is not supported except for portal icons when creating or editing Portals
        or configuring a Signal Mast.</li>
        <li>Most Control Panel Menus are disabled.</li>
        <li>Only track or portal or signal icons can be selected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Portal Icons</h3>
    When not in one of the CircuitBuilder editing modes, portal icons are usually invisible. The only
    situation in normal panel operation where they may be visible is when a warrant is allocated. 
    In this case direction arrows can be shown
    indicating the direction of travel of the warranted train.  Portal icons are necessary
    for CircuitBuilder to be able to define Portals and OPaths. In such editing modes the icon is
    usually a red circle that may be dragged or selected. <b>Note:</b> <i>It is important 
    for defining paths that every track circuit
    depicted on the panel have <b>all</b> its portals represented by a portal icon.</i> 

    <h2>The Circuit Builder Menu</h2>

    The menu has the following menu items: (except for the items "Add Detector Circuit" and "Error Checks"
    menu items). The menu item will first ask you to select an OBlock from a pick list.
    <ul>
     <li><b>Add Detector Circuit</b> - Create an OBlock track circuit and assign the icons that display it.
            You will be prompted for the system and user names to create a new OBlock.  Then
            you will be in <b>circuit editing</b> mode.</li>
     <li><b>Edit Circuit OBlock</b> - Edit an existing track circuit.  After choosing an OBlock,
     		you will be in <b>circuit editing</b> mode. In this window you select the track icons 
     		that represent the OBlock graphically and add sensors for occupancy.</li>
     <li><b>Edit Circuit Portals</b> -  Create or edit Portals connecting two track circuits.  After 
     		choosing an OBlock, you will be in <b>portal editing</b> mode. In this window you define
     		Portals by positioning them over track icons to connect OBlocks.</li>
     <li><b>Edit Circuit Paths</b> - Create or edit the paths (OPath) through a track circuit.  After
     		choosing an OBlock you will be in <b>path editing</b> mode. In this window you define 
     		OPaths by selecting track and portal icons.</li>
     <li><b>Edit Portal Direction Icons</b> - <span class="since">(since 3.8)</span> Choose arrows to 
     		indicate the direction of a Warrant route through a block. After
     		choosing an OBlock you will be in <b>portal icon editing</b> mode. In this window you
     		configure portal icons so they show the direction of travel when a warrant is allocated.</li>
     <li><b>Add/Edit Signal Icons</b> - <span class="since">(since 4.17.3)</span> Attach a Signal Mast to
     	    a Portal whose OBlocks are the approach block and block protected by the the signal.
     	    <b>signal icon editing</b> mode. In this window you blahh
     		configure portal icons so they show the direction of travel when a warrant is allocated.</li>
	 <li><a name="Errors" id="Errors"></a>
     		<b>Error Checks</b> - Provides information about objects that may require editing. These 
     		menu sub-items
     		either highlight the icons representing the object or display a list of track circuits or 
     		Portals that may require editing.  Selecting an item from such a list will open a window for 
     		the appropriate editing mode.
    	<ul>
        <li><b>Circuits without icons in this panel</b> - Has a submenu for each track circuit 
        	OBlock that does not have an icon. A track circuit needs at least one Indicator 
        	Track icon to display its state.</li>
        <li><b>Circuits whose icons need conversion</b> - Has a submenu for each track circuit OBlock 
        	whose track icons are not Indicator Track icons.<br>
        	<b>Note:</b> <i>Only Indicator Track icons can display circuit state information.</i></li>
        <li><b>Highlight track icons needing conversion</b> - Highlights all track icons that are not
        	Indicator Track icons.  If all track icons are Indicator Track icons, this menu item
        	it labeled <b>All track icons are Indicator icons</b></li>
        <li><b>Highlight Indicator Track icons without circuits</b> - Highlights all track icons that are not
        	associated with a track circuit.  If every track icon is associated with a circuit
        	this menu item is labeled <b>All track icons belong to Circuits</b> </li>
        <li><b>Circuits without a Portal or Path</b> - <span class="since">(since 4.17.3)</span> Has 
        	a submenu for each track circuit OBlock that does not have a Portal or Path.  
        	Select an item to add the required portal or Path.</li>
        <li><b>Circuits with misplaced Portal Icons</b> - <span class="since">(since 4.16)</span> Has a 
        	submenu for each track circuit OBlock that has a Portal icon positioned incorrectly. 
        <li><b>Highlight misplaced Portal Icons</b> - Highlights all portal icons that are not
        	positioned correctly.
        	If every portal icon is positioned correctly
        	this menu item is labeled <b>All Portal icons positioned OK</b> </li>
       	<li><b>Portals without icons in this panel</b> - <span class="since">(since 4.16)</span> Has a 
       		submenu for each Portal lacking an icon. Selecting an item opens a Portal Editing
       		window and an icon can be dragged onto the panel.</li>
        <li><b>Highlight Signals not configured to protect an OBlock</b> - <span class="since">(since 4.17.3)</span>
        	Highlights all signal icons not protecting an OBlock at a Portal.
        	If every signal icon provides protection correctly
        	this menu item is labeled <b>All Signal icons positioned OK</b> </li>
        <li><b>Check Portal and Path errors</b> - Examines the Portal and OPath definitions looking
        	for errors or incomplete information.  A dialog box is displayed listing any errors
        	found.</li>
    	</ul>
    </ul>

	Notice that except for the first and last menu items, first you choose the OBlock, then create or
	edit the element. For convenience, the Warrant menu item <b>Open CircuitBuilder</b> opens a
	window with the various editing modes available from radio buttons.
	
    <h2>How to Make OBlocks, Portals and OPaths</h2>
        Creation and editing of these objects is done is with the
        editing modes of Circuit Builder.

	<a name="OBlocks" id="OBlocks"></a>
    <h3>Creating OBlocks</h3>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Add OBlock Circuit</b> menu item.
     This opens a dialog for you to create a circuit OBlock by supplying its system and user name. Creating
     the OBlock opens the <b>Edit Circuit OBlock</b> window.<br><b>Note:</b> <i>Each OBlock must have 
     at least one Indicator Track icon to represent it. Otherwise CircuitBuilder cannot define
     Portals and Paths</i>

    <h3>Editing OBlocks</h3>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Edit Circuit OBlock</b> menu item.
     This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit. Selecting a row and pressing
     the <b>Show OBlock</b> button opens the <b>Edit Circuit</b> window. If any track icons have 
     been defined to indicate the OBlock, they will be highlighted in blue.

    <h4>Circuit Editing Mode</h4>
     The Edit Circuit window used is to identify
     all the track icons will display the track circuit.  It also configures the OBlock
     sensors for occupancy detection and error indication.  OBlock user names can be changed or have
     a track circuit OBlock. The length of block can be entered as either inches or centimeters.
     deleted.  Finally, the circuit track icons can be upgraded to be Indicator Track icons.
    <p>
     In this mode, mouse clicks on a track icon in the basic window frame toggles selection of the track.
     Select the icons you want to use to display the track circuit.
     The icons for a track circuit typically are, but need not be contiguous.
     The icons that display the circuit are highlighted in blue. Icon types other than track icons
     cannot be selected. No icons can be dragged.
    <ul>
        <li>At the top of the window is a non-editable field to show the current state of the circuit.</li>
        <li>The window has a text field showing the OBlock User Name. The field can be edited 
        to change the user name of the OBlock circuit and a
        <b>Change Name</b> button to accomplish the name change.</li>
        <li>The <b>Delete Circuit</b> button deletes all components of the track circuit. <b>Note</b> 
        this means, <i>the OBlock, <b>all</b> the
        OPaths in it and <b>all</b> portals into and out of the block.</i></li>
        <li>The window also has convenience fields that count the track icons
        that are selected for the circuit.</li>
        <li>When adding or editing a circuit, the window has text fields to name the sensor that will detect
        occupancy and a sensor that can indicate errors.  Each of these sensors are optional
        and can be entered later. There is an <b>Open Picklist</b> button to display sensor names that can be dragged
        and dropped onto the sensor name text fields.  If no occupancy detection sensor is named, the circuit will
        be a <b>Dark Block</b>.  Warrants are able to start, end or pass through dark blocks.</li>
        <li>The window has a text field to enter the length of the OBlock and button for either 
        inches or centimeter units.<br><b>Note:</b> <i>In order to create and run NXWarrants
        over a block, the block must have a length.  Running recorded warrants also needs
        block lengths to compute ramp parameters when responding to signals and other track
        conditions</i></li>
        <li>The <b>Convert Icons</b> button will convert the icons in the circuit to Track Indicator
        icons if they are not already icons of this type.  This can be done later.  Converted icons
        may need to be rotated and repositioned.</li>
        <li>The <b>Done</b> button completes the creation and editing of the track circuit.</li>
    </ul>

     When exiting the Edit Circuit window the OBlock is checked for any possible deficiencies. If
     any are detected you will be prompted and given the option to return to the window or 
     continue to close it.
    

	<a name="Portals" id="Portals"></a>
    <h3>Portals - Add/Edit Circuit Portals</h3>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Add/Edit Circuit Portals</b> menu item.
     This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit. Selecting a row and pressing
     the <b>Show OBlock</b> button opens the <b>Add/Edit Portal</b> window.
     The track circuit will be highlighted in blue. if any Portals have been defined, they
     will be shown as a red circle and also highlighted in blue.

    <h4>Portal Editing mode</h4>
    Use this window create and edit portals. A portal is represented by a red circle icon.
    The blocks it connects are determined by positioning a portal icon so it spans the two
    blocks it connects.  That is, the icon should overlap a track icon representing each of 
    the two blocks. In this mode, only portal icons can be repositioned.
    No other panel items can be moved or selected.
    <p>
    To create a new portal type in a name for it in the <b>Portal Name</b> text field. Then
    drag the red circle portal icon to the panel. Place it so that it intersects with 
    a track icon representing the OBlock you selected to open the window. The OBlock circuit 
    you selected is the "home" block. Position the portal icon so it also intersects with a 
    track icon representing an adjacent block. Overlapping both blocks defines the portal.
    </p><p>
    To create an icon for a portal previously defined, perhaps from the Occupancy Block tables,
    select the portal from the "Portals into and out of circuit ..." list. Then, as above
    drag and position the red circle icon.
    </p><p>
    Notice that when you select a portal from the portal list, its icon highlight 
    changes from blue to pink. Conversely, selecting an portal icon
    on the panel with a mouse click will select the portal it represents
    in the portal list.  When repositioning a portal icon it may be necessary to "unlock"
    its position.
    </p><p>
     There may be diagrams where a portal icon cannot span icons from each block
     that the portal connects. An example of this might be when the panel diagram depicts a loop
     as a line of blocks across the panel from left to right. Here a leftmost block icon 
     cannot be spanned by one from the rightmost block. This can be handled in one of two ways.
	 A non-contiguous track icon could be placed from one edge onto the opposite edge of the diagram
	 and a have the portal icon overlap both blocks there.<br>
	 <span class="since">(since 4.17.3)</span>
	 Or <b>two</b> portal icons can be used for the same portal.
	 Each icon placed on the respective blocks at the opposite sides of the diagram. 
    <ul>
        <li>The Edit Portal window has a list of the portals already defined for the
        track circuit (OBlock) and a text field to name new portals to be created. The window
        also has a icon to represent portals as a red circle in the main window.</li>
        <li>The text field can be used to change the name of a portal with the
        <b>Change Name</b> button to accomplish the name change.</li>
        <li>Portals are created by naming them in the text field and dragging the red
        circle icon to its position between the two track circuits it connects.  After dragging the
        icon into position the portal is listed in the Portal List.</li>
        <li>Portals that were created in the <b>Occupancy Tables</b> do not have red circle icons.
        For any portal in the Portal List that does not have an icon, select it from the list and
        drag a red circle icon to its position between the blocks it connects.
        Portal icons are needed to create and display paths.<br><b>Note</b> <i>Please be 
        sure <b>all</b> of the OBlock's portals are represented by icons before making paths.</i></li>
        <li>To change the name of a portal, first select it from the list, then change the name in the
        <b>Portal Name</b> text field and lastly, press the <b>Change Name</b> button.</li>
        <li>To delete a portal, select it from the list and press the <b>Delete Portal</b> button.</li>
        <li>The <b>Done</b> button completes the creation and/or editing of Portals.</li>
    </ul>

    When exiting the Add/Edit Portal window the Portal is checked for any possible deficiencies. If
    any are detected you will be prompted and given the option to return to the window or 
    continue to close it.
    

	<a name="OPaths" id="OPaths"></a>
    <h3>Paths - Add/Edit Circuit Paths</h3>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Add/Edit Circuit Paths</b> menu item.
     This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit. Selecting a row and pressing
     the <b>Show OBlock</b> button opens the <b>Add/Edit Path</b> window.
     The track circuit will be highlighted in blue and the portal icons
     shown with a red circle and highlighted in blue.

    <h4>Path Editing mode</h4>
    Use this window is to create and edit the paths in the track circuit.
    In this mode, no panel items can be moved and only track and portal icons can be selected.
    <p>
    To create a new OPath, first press the <b>Clear Selection</b> button. Then type a name for the
    path into the <b>Path Name</b> text field. Now select all
    the track icons that mark the route. Selected route icons change their color to green. 
    When selecting a turnout track icon, the position of
    the points may not be correct. <b><i>To change the position of the points</i></b>, hold the <b>Shift</b>
    key down while clicking on the turnout icon. At least one portal must be selected
    to complete the definition of an OPath.  A selected a portal icon changes from a red 
    circle to a green square.
    </p><p>
    Be sure you select all the turnout icons for turnouts that need to be set to define the path.  Also
    be sure that the portal icons needed for entrance and exit are selected. A path must have at
    least one portal and at most two.
    </p><p>
    If the value of the <b>Length</b> text field is "0.0" the length of the path will be inherited
    from the value of what was entered for the length of the OBlock circuit.  If the length of the
    path is significantly different from the OBlock length (i.e. by more than 10%), enter a length
    for the path. <b>Note:</b> Path lengths are needed for a warrant to calculate where to begin
    a speed change required by a signal aspect or block occupation ahead of the train.
    <ul>
        <li>The Edit Paths window has a list of the paths already defined for the track circuit
        	and a text field to name paths to be created.</li>
        <li>The text field can be used to change the name of a path with the
        	<b>Change Name</b> button to accomplish the name change.</li>
        <li>Paths are created by selecting the icons that display the path. The selected icons are
        	displayed green.  A second mouse click deselects the icon.</li>
        <li>When selecting a turnout icon for the path, it needs to have its points set correctly.  To keep
        	the icon selected green when you throw the switch, hold the Shift Key down when clicking
        	with the mouse.  This keeps the selection green while throwing the switch.</li>
        <li>It is important that portals for the entrance and/or exit of the path be selected also.
        	When a portal icon (red circle) is selected it turns into a green square.  A path may have
        	one portal selected, if it is a stub siding but must have two portals selected (entrance to and
        	exit from the block) if it is a through path.</li>
        <li>To change the name of a path, first select it from the list, then change the name in the
        	<b>Path Name</b> text field and lastly, press the <b>Change Name</b> button.</li>
        <li>The window has a text field to enter the length of the OPath and button for either 
        	inches or centimeter units.</li>
        <li>To delete a path, select it from the list and press the <b>Delete Path</b> button.</li>
    </ul>

    When exiting the Add/Edit Path window the Path is checked for any possible deficiencies. If
    any are detected you will be prompted and given the option to return to the window or 
    continue to close it.
    
	<a name="DirectionArrows" id="DirectionArrows"></a>
    <h3>Portals - Edit Portal Direction Icons</h3>
     <span class="since">Since 3.8</span><br>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Edit Portal Direction Icons</b> menu item.
     This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit. Selecting a row and pressing
     the <b>Show OBlock</b> button opens the <b>Edit Portal Direction Arrows</b> window.
     The track circuit will be highlighted in blue and the portal icons
     shown with a red circle and highlighted in blue.

    <h4>Portal Direction Arrows Editing</h4>
    Use this window to modify the portal icon to show the direction
    of travel for a warrant. Portal icons must exist in order to have direction arrows when a 
    warrant is allocated.
    <p>
    To set the direction, either select a portal icon or select a portal from the 
    "Portals into and out of circuit ..." list. A green arrow will replace the red circle on
     the highlighted portal icon. To have the arrow display the correct direction the arrow
	must point <b>into</b> the OBlock circuit. If it does not, select one or the other of the
	green arrows on the <b>Entry Icon</b> box. The arrows can be moved and rotated to display a
	more desirable direction. <i>If a n icon is moved, be sure it retains its position 
	overlapping the blocks it joins.</i> 
	</p><p>
	If you do not want an arrow to display at the portal when
	a warrant is allocated, select the "No Icon" icon.
	</p><p>
	After all the portal icon arrows are pointing into the block, verify that each adjacent OBock 
	also has its portal direction arrow set <b>into</b> that block.</p>

    <h3>Signals - Edit Signal Masts</h3>
     <span class="since">Since 4.17.3</span><br>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Add/Edit Signal Masts</b> menu item.
     This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock where you want to have
     protection by signals. Selecting a row and pressing
     the <b>Show OBlock</b> button opens the <b>Add/Edit Signals</b> window.
     The track circuit icons will be highlighted in blue and the portal icons
     shown with a red circle highlighted in blue.

   <h4>Signal Position Editing</h4>
    Use this window to configure a Signal Head or Signal Mast to protect the OBlock. There is a
    "speed name" associated with every signal aspect that limits the speed a train may have 
    through the protected block. The speed names are mapped to speed numbers
    by a table in Warrant Preferences. Warrants use the speed number to modify the scripted 
    speed before entering the block.  The meaning of the speed number
    is interpreted to be
    <ul>
    	<li>scale miles per hour</li>
    	<li>scale kilometers per hour</li>
    	<li>percentage of full throttle</li>
    	<li>percentage of the warrant script speed</li>
    </ul>
    according to your choice of a radio button in Warrant Preferences.
    <p>
    To set a signal to protect the OBlock, choose the portal where the signal will guard
    entrance into the block. The opposing block of the portal will be the
    approach OBlock. Choosing the portal can be done by
    either selecting a highlighted portal icon or selecting a portal from the 
    "Portals into and out of circuit ..." list.
    </p><p>
    Enter the name of the signal into the <b>Signal Name</b> text field. Alternatively
    there are <b>Open Picklist</b> buttons to display signal names. Drag a name into
    the Signal Name text field. Pressing the <b>Configure Signal</b> button will attach the signal
    at the portal. 
    </p><P>
    <b>Important Note:</b><br>
    It is recommended to use Signal Masts rather than Signal Heads.  If you do use a Signal Head
    be sure it is <b>not</b> part of the definition of a Signal Mast. Signal Head appearances are
    translated to speed names according to to a table in Warrant Preferences. Then,
    as above, the speed name is used to regulate train speed.
	</p><p>
	The signal add/edit window has the following items.
    <ul>
    	<li>A list of the portals into the OBlock. Select a portal to add or remove the 
    		block protection by a signal. If a signal already protects at the selected
    		portal, its name is displayed in the Signal Name text field.</li>
    	<li>A Signal Name text field for the name of a protecting signal.</li>
    	<li>Buttons to set block protection or remove it.</li>
    	<li>Buttons to display pick lists for dragging signal names into the
    		Signal Name text field</li>
    	<li>A text field to adjust the target point a warrant calculates for the
    		place where a speed change should start, if a
    		signal aspect requires it. (Speed changes required in a protected block
    		must be completed before entering the block.)  The number is an offset
    		from the portal entrance point to the block. It may be positive or negative.</li>
    </ul>
	Selecting a signal icon will select the portal if it protects the block there.
	Otherwise a dialog windows opens to configure or replace protection.
