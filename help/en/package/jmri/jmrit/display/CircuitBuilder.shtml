    <h1>Circuit Builder</h1>

    <p><span class="since">Since 2.12</span><br>
    The <b>Circuit Builder</b> is a view of a <b>Control Panel Editor</b>
    panel. It is a graphical way to create track circuits that are implemented in JMRI
    by <a href="../logix/OBlockTable.shtml">OBlocks, Portals and OPaths</a>. The
    prototype name for track having a device that can detect occupancy is
    <b>Track Circuit</b>.  In JMRI we have misused the term <i>"Block"</i> and
    <i>"OBlock"</i> to refer to what in the prototype world is a track circuit.
    The term <b>Block</b> in the prototype world is <i>a length of track defined
    by limits, whose use is governed by block signals, cab signals or block limit
    markers and train orders.</i>  That is, a prototype block incorporates a
    signaling system providing a way to manage safe usage of its trackage.  So
    to model a prototype block, several track circuits may be needed.
    The term JMRI track circuit is just an attempt to get a little closer to
    prototype usage.  For now, the Circuit Builder tool is concerned with the
    creation of track circuits, that is, making OBlocks and their elements.
    </p><p>
    Circuit Builder is an alternative to using the
    <a href="../logix/OBlockTable.shtml">Occupancy Block Tables</a>.
    OBlocks, Portals and OPaths are created and linked by "point and click" on the
    icons of your layout diagram or panel.  The three element types (OBlock, Portal,
    OPath) are created and edited using various editing modes of the tool.  The result
    of this editing transforms the track in your layout panels to indicator trackage
    displaying the states of the blocks and their paths by color without altering the
    original look of the panel.
    </p><p>
    Panel files previously made with Panel Editor
    can be used with Circuit Builder as long as they can be loaded into this
    version of JMRI.  Circuit Builder will upgrade the track icons to
    Indicator Track icons.  See <a href="ItemPalette.shtml">The Item Palette</a>
    for more information about Indicator track icons.
    </p><p>
    CircuitBuilder relys on icons to represent OBlocks, Portals and OPaths. Manipulating
    these icons by selection or position can create OBlocks, Portals and OPaths. CircuitBuilder
    is aware of all the objects defined in the Occupancy Block tables. If your layout track
    diagram is split up among several panels, CircuitBuilder will only edit with the icons on
    each panel separately. It may post messages about missing icons but if the objects
    are not meant to be represented on that panel, ignore them.
    </p>

    <h3>Mouse Operations When Using CircuitBuilder</h3>
    When in an editing mode of
    Circuit Builder, the mouse click conventions differ somewhat from those of the panel editors.
    When a Circuit Builder menu item is selected an editing window is opened and the panel is in
    a Circuit Builder editing mode. Note the following when in a Circuit Builder editing mode:
    <ul>
        <li>Dragging is not supported except for portal icons when creating or editing Portals</li>
        <li>Most Control Panel Menus are disabled.</li>
        <li>Only track and portal icons can be selected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Portal Icons</h3>
    When not in one of the CircuitBuilder editing modes, portal icons are usually invisible. The only
    situation in normal panel operation where they may be visible is when a warrant is allocated. 
    In this case there may be direction arrows
    indicating the direction of travel of the warranted train.  However, they are a necessity
    for CircuitBuilder to be able to define Portals and OPaths. In such editing modes the icon is
    usually a red circle that may be dragged or selected. <b>Note:</b> <i>It is important 
    for defining paths that every
    block depicted on the panel have <b>all</b> its portals represented by a portal icon.</i> 

    <h2>The Circuit Builder Menu</h2>

    The menu has the following menu items: Except for the items "Add Detector Circuit" and "Error Checks", 
    the menu item will first ask you to select an OBlock from a pick list.
    <ul>
     <li><b>Add Detector Circuit</b> - Create an OBlock track circuit and assign the icons that display it.
            You will be prompted for the system and user names to create a new OBlock.  Then
            you will be in <b>circuit editing</b> mode.</li>
     <li><b>Edit Circuit OBlock</b> - Edit an existing circuit (OBlock).  After choosing an OBlock,
     		you will be in <b>circuit editing</b> mode. In this window you select the track icons 
     		that represent the OBlock graphically.</li>
     <li><b>Edit Circuit Portals</b> -  Create or edit Portals connecting two track circuits.  After 
     		choosing an OBlock, you will be in <b>portal editing</b> mode. In this window you define
     		Portals by positioning them over track icons to connect OBlocks.</li>
     <li><b>Edit Circuit Paths</b> - Create or edit the paths (OPath) through a track circuit.  After
     		choosing an OBlock you will be in <b>path editing</b> mode. In this window you define 
     		OPaths by selecting track and portal icons.</li>
     <li><b>Edit Portal Direction Icons</b> - <span class="since">(since 3.8) </span>Choose arrows to 
     		indicate the direction of a Warrant route through a block. After
     		choosing an OBlock you will be in <b>portal icon editing</b> mode. In this window you
     		configure portal icons so they show the direction of travel when a warrant is allocated.</li>
     <li><b>Error Checks</b> - Provides information about objects that may require editing. These items
     		either highlight the icons representing the object or display a list of track circuits or 
     		Portals that may require editing.  Selecting an item from such a list will open a window for 
     		the appropriate editing mode.
    	<ul>
        <li><b>Circuits without icons in this panel</b> - Has a submenu for each track circuit 
        	OBlock that does not have an icon. A track circuit needs at least one Indicator 
        	Track icon to display its state.</li>
        <li><b>Circuits whose icons need conversion</b> - Has a submenu for each track circuit OBlock 
        	whose track icons are not Indicator Track icons.<br>
        	<b>Note:</b> <i>Only Indicator Track icons can display circuit state information.</i></li>
        <li><b>Highlight track icons needing conversion</b> - Highlights all track icons that are not
        	Indicator Track icons.  If all track icons are Indicator Track icons, this menu item
        	it labeled <b>All track icons are Indicator icons</b></li>
        <li><b>Highlight Indicator Track icons without circuits</b> - Highlight all track icons that are not
        	associated with a track circuit.  If every track icon is associated with a circuit
        	this menu item is labeled <b>All track icons belong to Circuits</b> </li>
        <li><b>Circuits with misplaced Portal Icons</b> - <span class="since">(since 4.16) </span>Has a 
        	submenu for each track circuit OBlock that has a Portal icon positioned incorrectly. 
        <li><b>Highlight misplaced Portal Icons</b> - Highlights all portal icons that are not
        	positioned correctly.
        	If every portal icon is positioned correctly
        	this menu item is labeled <b>All Portal icons positioned OK</b> </li>
       	<li><b>Portals without icons in this panel</b> - <span class="since">(since 4.16) </span>Has a 
       		submenu for each Portal lacking an icon. Selecting an item opens a Portal Editing
       		window and an icon can be dragged onto the panel.</li>
        <li><b>Check Portal and Path errors</b> - Examines the Portal and OPath definitions looking
        	for errors or incomplete information.  A dialog box is displayed listing any errors
        	found.</li>
    	</ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make OBlocks, Portals and OPaths</h2>
        Creation and editing of these objects is done is with three
        editing modes of Circuit Builder.

    <h3>OBlocks - Circuit Editing mode</h3>

    <h4>Creating OBlocks</h4>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Add OBlock Circuit</b> menu item.
     This opens a dialog for you to create a circuit OBlock by supplying its system and user name. Creating
     the OBlock opens the <b>Edit Circuit OBlock</b> window.<br><b>Note:</b> <i>Each OBlock must have 
     at least one Indicator Track icon to represent it. Otherwise CircuitBuilder cannot define
     Portals and Paths</i>

    <h4>Editing OBlocks</h4>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Edit Circuit OBlock</b> menu item.
     This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit. Selecting a row and pressing
     the <b>Show OBlock</b> button opens the <b>Edit Circuit</b> window.

    <h4>Circuit Editing Mode</h4>
     The Edit Circuit window used is to identify
     all the track icons will display the track circuit.  It also configures the OBlock
     sensors for occupancy detection and error indication.  OBlock user names can be changed or have
     a track circuit OBlock. The length of block can be entered as either inches or centimeters.
     deleted.  Finally, the circuit track icons can be upgraded to be Indicator Track icons.
    <p>
     In this mode, mouse clicks on a track icon in the basic window frame toggles selection of the track.
     Select the icons you want to use to display the track circuit.
     The icons for a track circuit typically are, but need not be contiguous.
     The icons that display the circuit are highlighted in blue. Icon types other than track icons
     cannot be dragged or selected.
    <ul>
        <li>At the top of the window is a non-editable field to show the current state of the circuit.</li>
        <li>The window has a text field showing the OBlock User Name. The field can be edited 
        to change the name of the OBlock circuit and a
        <b>Change Name</b> button to accomplish the name change.</li>
        <li>The <b>Delete Circuit</b> button deletes all components of the track circuit. <b>Note</b> 
        this means, <i>the OBlock, <b>all</b> the
        OPaths in it and <b>all</b> portals into and out of the block.</i></li>
        <li>The window also has convenience fields that count the track icons
        that are selected for the circuit.</li>
        <li>When adding or editing a circuit, the window has text fields to name the sensor that will detect
        occupancy and a sensor that can detect power problems.  Each of these sensors are optional
        and can be entered later. There is an <b>Open Picklist</b> button to display sensor names that can be dragged
        and dropped onto the sensor name text fields.  If no occupancy detection sensor is named, the circuit will
        be a <b>Dark Block</b>.  Warrants are able to start, end or pass through dark blocks.</li>
        <li>The window has a text field to enter the length of the OBlock and button for either 
        inches or centimeter units.<br><b>Note:</b> <i>In order to create and run NXWarrants
        over a block, the block must have a length.  Running recorded warrants also needs
        block lengths to compute ramp parameters when responding to signals and other track
        conditions</i></li>
        <li>The <b>Convert Icons</b> button will convert the icons in the circuit to Track Indicator
        icons if they are not already icons of this type.  This can be done later.  Converted icons
        may need to be rotated and repositioned.</li>
        <li>The <b>Done</b> button completes the creation and editing of the track circuit.</li>
    </ul>

     When exiting the Edit Circuit window the OBlock is checked for any possible deficiencies. If
     any are detected you will be prompted and given the option to return to the window or 
     continue to close it.
    

    <h3>Portals - Add/Edit Circuit Portals</h3>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Add/Edit Circuit Portals</b> menu item.
     This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit. Selecting a row and pressing
     the <b>Show OBlock</b> button opens the <b>Add/Edit Portal</b> window.
     The track circuit will be highlighted in blue. if any Portals have been defined, they
     will be shown with a red circle and also highlighted in blue.

    <h4>Portal Editing mode</h4>
    Use this window create and edit portals. A portal is represented by a red circle icon.
    The blocks it connects are determined by positioning a portal icon so it spans the two
    blocks it connects.  That is, the icon should overlap a track icon representing each of 
    the two blocks. In this mode, only portal icons can be repositioned.
    No other panel items can be moved or selected.
    <p>
    To create a new portal type in a name for it in the <b>Portal Name</b> text field. Then
    drag the red circle portal icon to the panel. Place it so that it intersects with 
    a track icon representing the OBlock you selected to open the window. The OBlock circuit 
    you selected is the "home" block. Position the portal icon so it also intersects with a 
    track icon representing an adjacent block. Overlapping both blocks defines the portal.
    </p><p>
    To create an icon for a portal previously defined, perhaps from the Occupancy Block tables,
    select the portal from the "Portals into and out of circuit ..." list. Then, as above
    drag and position the red circle icon.
    </p><p>
    Notice that when you select a portal from the portal list, its icon highlight 
    changes from blue to pink. Conversely, selecting an portal icon
    on the panel with a mouse click will select the portal it represents
    in the portal list.  When repositioning a portal icon it may be necessary to "unlock"
    its position.
    </p><p>
     There may be diagrams where a portal icon cannot span icons from each block
     that the portal connects. An example of this is when the track diagram depicts a loop
     as a line of blocks across the panel from left to right. Here a leftmost block icon 
     cannot be spanned by one from the rightmost block. This is a case where one of the
     blocks must have a dis-contiguous track icon. To define such a portal, place an 
     extra track icon from one block adjacent to an icon of the other. 
    <ul>
        <li>The Edit Portal window has a list of the portals already defined for the
        track circuit (OBlock) and a text field to name new portals to be created. The window
        also has a icon to represent portals as a red circle in the main window.</li>
        <li>The text field can be used to change the name of a portal with the
        <b>Change Name</b> button to accomplish the name change.</li>
        <li>Portals are created by naming them in the text field and dragging the red
        circle icon to its position between the two track circuits it connects.  After dragging the
        icon into position the portal is listed in the Portal List.</li>
        <li>Portals that were created in the <b>Occupancy Tables</b> do not have red circle icons.
        For any portal in the Portal List that does not have an icon, select it from the list and
        drag a red circle icon to its position between the blocks it connects.
        Portal icons are needed to create and display paths.<br><b>Note</b> <i>Please be 
        sure <b>all</b> of the OBlock's portals are represented by icons before making paths.</i></li>
        <li>To change the name of a portal, first select it from the list, then change the name in the
        <b>Portal Name</b> text field and lastly, press the <b>Change Name</b> button.</li>
        <li>To delete a portal, select it from the list and press the <b>Delete Portal</b> button.</li>
        <li>The <b>Done</b> button completes the creation and/or editing of Portals.</li>
    </ul>

    When exiting the Add/Edit Portal window the Portal is checked for any possible deficiencies. If
    any are detected you will be prompted and given the option to return to the window or 
    continue to close it.
    

    <h3>Paths - Add/Edit Circuit Paths</h3>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Add/Edit Circuit Paths</b> menu item.
     This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit. Selecting a row and pressing
     the <b>Show OBlock</b> button opens the <b>Add/Edit Path</b> window.
     The track circuit will be highlighted in blue and the portal icons
     shown with a red circle and highlighted in blue.

    <h4>Path Editing mode</h4>
    Use this window is to create and edit the paths in the track circuit.
    In this mode, no panel items can be moved or selected.
    <p>
    To create a new OPath, first press the <b>Clear Selection</b> button. Then type a name for the
    path into the <b>Path Name</b> text field. Now select all
    the track icons that mark the route. Selected route icons change their color to green. 
    When selecting a turnout track icon, the position of
    the points may not be correct. <i>To change the <b>position</b> of the points</i>, hold the <b>Shift</b>
    key down while clicking on the turnout icon. One or two portals must also be selected
    to complete the definition of an OPath.  A selected a portal icon changes from a red 
    circle to a green square.
    </p><p>
    Be sure you select all the turnout icons for turnouts that need to be set to define the path.  Also
    be sure that the portals needed for entrance and or exit have icons and that they are selected.
    </p><p>
    If the value of the <b>Length</b> text field is "0.0" the length of the path will be inherited
    from the value of what was entered for the length of the OBlock circuit.  If the length of the
    path is significantly different from the OBlock length (i.e. by more than 10%), enter a length
    for the path.
    <ul>
        <li>The Edit Paths window has a list of the paths already defined for the track circuit
        	and a text field to name paths to be created.</li>
        <li>The text field can be used to change the name of a path with the
        	<b>Change Name</b> button to accomplish the name change.</li>
        <li>Paths are created by selecting the icons that display the path. The selected icons are
        	displayed green.  A second mouse click deselects the icon.</li>
        <li>When selecting a turnout icon for the path, it needs to have its points set correctly.  To keep
        	the icon selected green when you throw the switch, hold the Shift Key down when clicking
        	with the mouse.  This keeps the selection green while throwing the switch.</li>
        <li>It is important the portals for the entrance and/or exit of the path be selected also.
        	When a portal icon (red circle) is selected it turns into a green square.  A path will have
        	one portal selected, if it is a stub siding and must have two portals selected (entrance to and
        	exit from the block) if it is a through path.</li>
        <li>To change the name of a path, first select it from the list, then change the name in the
        	<b>Path Name</b> text field and lastly, press the <b>Change Name</b> button.</li>
        <li>The window has a text field to enter the length of the OPath and button for either 
        	inches or centimeter units.</li>
        <li>To delete a path, select it from the list and press the <b>Delete Path</b> button.</li>
    </ul>

    When exiting the Add/Edit Path window the Path is checked for any possible deficiencies. If
    any are detected you will be prompted and given the option to return to the window or 
    continue to close it.
    

    <h3>Portals - Edit Portal Direction Icons</h3>
     From the <b>Circuit Builder</b> menu select the <b>Edit Portal Direction Icons</b> menu item.
     This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit. Selecting a row and pressing
     the <b>Show OBlock</b> button opens the <b>Edit Portal Direction Arrows</b> window.
     The track circuit will be highlighted in blue and the portal icons
     shown with a red circle and highlighted in blue.

    <h4>Portal Direction Arrows Editing</h4>
    Use this window set the direction of the portal icon when it is being used to show the direction
    of travel of a warrant. Portal icons must exist in oder to have direction arrows when a 
    warrant is allocated.
    <p>
    To set the direction, either select a portal icon or select a portal from the 
    "Portals into and out of circuit ..." list. A green arrow will replace the red circle on
     the highlighted portal icon. To have the arrow display the correct direction the arrow
	must point <b>into</b> the OBlock circuit. If it does not, select one or the other of the
	green arrows on the <b>Entry Icon</b> box. The arrows can be rotated to display in a
	more desirable direction.  
	</p><p>
	If you do not want an arrow to display at the portal when
	a warrant is allocated, select the "No Icon" icon.</p>
