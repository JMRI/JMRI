<H1>Circuit Builder</H1>

<b>The Circuit Builder</b> is a view of a <b>Control Panel Editor</b>  
panel used to create track circuits that are implemented in JMRI by 
OBlocks, Portals and OPaths. The
prototype name for track having a device that can detect occupancy is
<b>Track Circuit</b>.  In JMRI we have misused the term <i>"Block"</i> and
<i>"OBlock"</i> to refer to what in the prototype world is a track circuit.
The term <b>Block</b> in the prototype world is <i>a length of track defined
by limits, whose use is governed by block signals, cab signals or block limit 
markers and train orders.</i>  That is, a prototype block incorporates a 
signalling system providing a way to manage safe usage of its trackage.  Combining
JMRI track circuits into such blocks will be addressed later.  For now, the 
Circuit Builder tool is concerned with the creation of track circuits.
</p>
<p>Circuit Builder is an alternative to using the Occupancy Block Tables.
OBlocks, Portals and OPaths are created and linked by "point and click" on the
icons of your layout diagram or panel.  The three element types (OBlock, Portal,
OPath) are created and edited using three editing modes of the tool.  The result
of this editing transforms the track in your layout panels to indicator trackage that 
displays the states of the blocks and paths by color without altering the 
original look of the panel.</p>
<p>     
Panel files previously made with Panel Editor
can be used with Circuit Builder as long as they can be loaded into this
version of JMRI.  Circuit Builder will upgrade the track icons to
Indicator Track icons.  See <A HREF="ItemPalette.shtml"> The Item Palette</A>
for more information about indicator track icons.
</p>

 
<H3>Mouse Operations</H3>
When in one of the editing modes of
Circuit Builder, the mouse click conventions differ somewhat from those of the panel editors.
When one the menu items is selected an editing window is opened and the panel is in Circuit 
Builder editing mode. Note the following when in CircuitBuilder editing mode:
<ul>
<li>Dragging is not supported except for portal icons when creating or editing Portals</li>
<li>Several Control Panel Menus are disabled.</li>
<li>Only track and portal icons can be selected.</li>
</ul>

<H2>The Menus</H2>
   
<H3>The File Menu</H3>
The only menu item, <b>Change View to Control Panel Editor</b>, returns the CircuitBuilder 
view to the Control Panel Editor view.</P>

<H3>Menus in Common With Control Panel Editor</H3>
The <b>Edit, Options, Zoom</b> and <b>Add Item</b> menus are identical to those in Control
Panel Editor.  When in an editing mode (i.e. in any of menu items under the <b>Add/Edit Circuits</b>
menu) these menus are disabled. 

<H3>The Circuit Builder Menu</H3>
Creates and Edit OBlocks, Portals and OPaths and their display icons. The menu has the following menu items:
<ul>
 <li><b>Add Detector Circuit</b> - Create an OBlock track circuit and assign the icons that display it. 
        You will be prompted for the system and user names to create a new OBlock.  Then
        you will be in <b>circuit editing</b> mode.</li>
 <li><b>Edit Circuit OBlock</b> - Edit an existing circuit (OBlock).  You will be asked to select an OBlock
        from a picklist.  Then you will be in <b>circuit editing</b> mode.</li>
 <li><b>Edit Circuit Portals</b> -  Create or edit Portals connecting two track circuits.  You will be 
        asked to select an OBlock from a picklist.  Then you will be in <b>portal editing</b> mode.</li>
 <li><b>Edit Circuit Paths</b> - Create or edit the paths (OPath) through a track circuit.  You will be 
        asked to select an OBlock from a picklist.  Then you will be in <b>path editing</b> mode.</li>
 <li><b>Edit Portal Direction Icons</b> - Choose arrows to indicate the direction of a warrant route
 		through a block.  You will be asked to select an OBlock from a picklist.  
        Then you will be in <b>Portal icon editing</b> mode.</li>
</ul>

<H3>The Error Check Menu Item</H3>
Verify OBlocks, Portals and OPaths are complete and without errors. The menu has the following menu items:
<ul>
 <li><b>Circuits without icons</b> - Has a submenu for each track circuit OBlock that does not have an icon.
        A track circuit needs at least one indicator track icon to display its state.</li>
 <li><b>Circuits whose icons need conversion</b> - Has a submenu for each track circuit OBlock whose track icons
        are not Indicator Track icons.  
        <ul><b>Note:</b> <i>If track icons are not converted to indicator track icons
        the information needed to display circuit states cannot be saved.</i>
        </ul></li>        
 <li><b>Highlight track icons needing conversion</b> - Highlights all track icons that are not 
        Indicator Track icons.  If all track icons are Indicator Track icons, this menu item
        it labeled <b>All track icons are Indicator icons</b></li>
 <li><b>Highlight indicator track icons without circuits</b> - Highlight all track icons that are not 
        associated with a track circuit.  If every track icon is associated with a circuit
        this menu item is labeled <b>All track icons belong to Circuits</b> </li>
 <li><b>Circuits with Portal Icons misplaced</b> - Has a submenu for each track circuit OBlock that
        has a warning about Portal icon positioning.  THe posibilities are: 
        <ul>A portal icon is positioned incorrectly. i.e. not placed spanning the two blocks
        that of the Portal.
        <br>A portal icon spans an adjacent circuit with no Indicator icons.
        </ul>
        Note: When a circuit's icons are not converted to Indicator icons, after saving and reloaded
        portal icons will not be able to detect whether it spans that circuit.</li>
 <li><b>Check Portal and Path errors</b> - Examines the Portal and OPath definitions looking
        for errors or incomplete information.  A dialog box is displayed listing any errors
        found.</li>
</ul>

<H2>How to Make OBlocks, Portals and OPaths</H2>
Creation and editing of these objects is done is with three editing modes of CircuitBuilder.
<H3>OBlocks - Circuit Editing mode</H3>
<H4>Creating OBlocks</H4>
<ul>
 1. From the <b>Add/Edit Circuits</b> menu select the <b>Add Detector Circuit</b> menu item.
 This opens a dialog for you to create a circuit OBlock by supplying its system and user name.  Creating
 the OBlock opens the <b>Add Detector Circuit</b> window.
<p>
 The Add Detector Circuit window is identical to the Edit Circuit window.  See the Circuit Editing mode
 section below for information about this window.
</ul>
<H4>Editing OBlocks</H4>
<ul>
 1. From the <b>Add/Edit Circuits</b> menu select the <b>Edit Circuit Block</b> menu item.
 This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit.  Selecting a row and pressing
 the <Open Circuit> button opens the <b>Edit Circuit</b> window.
</ul>
<H4>Circuit Editing mode</H4>
The Edit Circuit window is identical to the Add Detector Circuit window.  Its purpose is to identify
all the track icons that are used to display the track circuit.  It also configures the OBlock
sensors for occupancy detection and error indication.  Oblock names can be changed and the track circuit 
deleted.  Finally, the circuit track icons can be upgraded to Indicator Track icons.
<ul>
 1. In this mode, mouse clicks on a track icon in the basic window frame toggles selection of the track. 
 Select the icons you want to use
 to display the track circuit (i.e. OBlock).  The icons for a track circuit should be contiguous.
 The icons that display the circuit are highlighted in blue.  Selecting other icon types
 has no effect.  Also, panel items cannot be dragged and repositioned.
</ul>
   
<H4>Circuit Editing mode Dialog Box</H4>
<ul>
 2. When adding or editing a circuit, the dialog window has text fields to name the sensor that will detect
 occupancy and a sensor that can detect power problems.  Each of these sensors are optional
 and can be entered later.  If no occupancy detection sensor is named the circuit will 
 be a <b>Dark Block</b>.  There is a [Open Picklist] button to display sensor names that can be dragged 
 and dropped in the sensor text fields.
<p>
 3. The dialog window has a field to show the current state of the circuit.  
<p>
 4. The Dialog window also has convenience fields that count the track icons
 that are selected for the circuit.  
<p>
 5. he Dialog window has a text field to change the name of the circuit (Oblock user name) and a
 [Change Name] button to accomplish a name change.
<p> 
 6. The <b>Convert Icons</b> button will convert the icons in the circuit to Track Indicator
 icons if they are not already icons of this type.  This can be done later.  Converted icons
 may need to be repositioned. This can be done after leaving Circuit Editing mode (pressing
 the <Done> button).
<p>
 7. The <b>Done</b> button completes the creation and editing of the track circuit.
<p>
 8. The <b>Delete Circuit</b> button deletes all components of the track circuit. That is, the OBlock,
 all the OPaths in it and the Portals into and out of the block.
</ul>
You may leave <b>Dark</b> blocks (no occupancy detection) with track icons unconverted.
There is a trade-off here on the appearance.
  
<H3>Portals</H3>
<ul>
 1. From the <b>Add/Edit Circuits</b> menu select the <b>Edit Circuit Portals</b> menu item.  
 This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit.  Selecting a row and pressing
 the <Open Circuit> button opens the <b>Add/Edit Portal</b> window.
 The track circuit will be highlighted in blue and if any Portals have been defined, they
 will be shown with a red circle. 
</ul>
<H4>Portal Editing mode</H4>
 The purpose of this window is to create and edit portals. A portal is represented by a red circle icon.
 The blocks it connects are determined by positioning the portal icon so it spans the two
 blocks it connects.  That is, circle the gap between the two blocks with the red circle.
 In this mode, only portal icons can be repositioned.  No other panel items can be moved or selected.
 <p>
 Portal icons are needed to graphically define <b>Paths</b> (See the next section).  They serve no
 other purpose.  After you have defined all the track circuits and the Portals and Paths 
 needed to calulate routes; and have created and run warrants; and have tested everything
 sufficiently, these icons can be removed.  On the other hand, there is no harm in letting
 them persist.  They are only visible in the Circuit Builder view.
<ul>
 1. The Edit Portal window has a list of the the portals already defined for the
 track circuit (OBlock) and a text field to name new portals to be created. The window
 also has a icon to represent portals as a red circle in the main window.
<p>  
 2. The text field can be used to change the name of a portal with the
 [Change Name] button to accomplish the name change.
<p> 
 3. Portals are created by naming them in the text field and dragging the red
 circle icon to its position between the two track circuits it connects.  After dragging the
 icon into position the portal is listed in the Portal List. 
<p>
 4. Portals that were created in the <b>Occupancy Tables</b> do not have red circle icons.
 For any portal in the Portal List that does not have an icon, select it from the list and
 drag a red circle icon to its position between the blocks it connects.  
 Portal icons are needed to create and display paths.  <i>Please be sure all portals are 
 represented by icons before making paths.</i>
 <p>
 5. To change the name of a portal, first select it from the list, then change the name in the
 <b>Portal Name</b> text field and lastly, press the <b>Change Name</b> button.
 <p>
 6. To delete a portal, select it from the list and press the <b>Delete Portal</b> button.
 7. The <b>Done</b> button completes the creation and/or editing of Portals.
</ul> 

<H3>Paths</H3>
<ul>
 1. From the <b>Add/Edit Circuits</b> menu select the <b>Edit Circuit Paths</b> menu item.  
 This opens a picklist for you to select a circuit OBlock to edit.  Selecting a row and pressing
 the <Open Circuit> button opens the <b>Add/Edit Path</b> window.  
 The track circuit will be highlighted in blue and if any Portals have been defined, they
 will be shown with a red circle. 
<p>
</ul>
<H4>Path Editing mode</H4>
 The purpose of this window is to create and edit the paths in the track circuit.  
 In this mode, no panel items can be moved or selected.
<ul>
 1. The Edit Paths window has a list of the the paths already defined for the track circuit
  and a text field to name paths to be created.
<p>
 2. The text field can be used to change the name of a path with the
 [Change Name] button to accomplish the name change.
<p> 
 3. Paths are created by selecting the icons that display the path. The selected icons are
 displayed green.  A second mouse click deselects the icon.
<p>
 4. When selecting a turnout icon for the path, it needs to have its points set correctly.  To keep
 the icon selected gren wheen you throw the switch, hold the Shift Key down when clicking 
 with the mouse.  This keeps the selection green while throwing the switch.  
<p>
 5. It is important the portals for the entrance and/or exit of the path be selected also.
 When a portal icon (red circle) is selected it turns into a green square.  A path will have 
 one portal selected, if it is a stub siding and must have two portals selected (entrance to and 
 exit from the block) if it is a through path.  
<p> 
 6. To change the name of a path, first select it from the list, then change the name in the
 <b>Path Name</b> text field and lastly, press the <b>Change Name</b> button.
<p>
 7. To delete a path, select it from the list and press the <b>Delete Path</b> button.
