<h1>The MultiSensor Icon Editor</h1>

<p>The way icons are changed in the MultiSensor Icon Editor is the same as they are
changed in the other Icon Editors.  The <b>Change Icon...</b>button and the 
Catalog function identically with other Icon Editors. The <b>Find Icons</b> 
menu and its items are 
also identical.<p>  See the <a href="IconAdder.shtml">Icon Editors page</a> 
and the <a href="../catalog/ImageIndex.shtml">Image Index Editor page</a>
for details on their use.


<h2>Contents of the MultiSensor Icon Editor</h2>

<img src="MultiSensorIcon.png" align="right">
<p>The icons in the MultiSensor Icon Editor differ only in that there are several
"active" icons.  Each corresponds to a switch or lever position.  In the Panel,
the positions are cycled through in sequence.  A position can be deleted by 
pressing the <b>Delete</b> button under the icon.  Additional positions can
be added by pressing the <b>Add Another Icon</b> button.

<p>Each active icon must have a sensor associated with it.  To assign a
sensor to an icon position, drag a row from the Sensor table to the place
in the icon position pane labeled "undefined".  When the sensor row is 
dropped on the label, it will display the sensor name.</p>

<p>When all the active icons are assigned sensors, the <b>Add to Panel</b>
button will become active and it can be pressed to install the Multisensor
into the Panel.
