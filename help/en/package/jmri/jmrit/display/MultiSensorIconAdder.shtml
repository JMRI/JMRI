      <h1>The MultiSensor Icon Editor</h1>

      <p>The way icons are changed in the MultiSensor Icon Editor is the same as they are changed
      in the other Icon Editors. The <strong>Change Icon...</strong>button and the Catalog function
      identically with other Icon Editors.<br>
      The <strong>Find Icons</strong> menu and its items are also identical.</p>

      <p>See the <a href="IconAdder.shtml">Icon Editors page</a> and the <a href=
      "../catalog/ImageIndex.shtml">Image Index Editor page</a> for details on their use.</p>

      <h2>Contents of the MultiSensor Icon Editor</h2>
      <img src="images/MultiSensorIcon.png" class="floatRight" alt="add multi sensor icon">
      <p>The icons in the MultiSensor Icon Editor differ only in that there are several "active"
      icons. Each corresponds to a switch or lever position. In the Panel, the positions are cycled
      through in sequence. A position can be deleted by pressing the <strong>Delete</strong> button
      under the icon. Additional positions can be added by pressing the <strong>Add another
      Icon</strong> button.</p>

      <p>Each active icon must have a sensor associated with it. To assign a sensor to an icon
      position, drag a row from the Sensor table to the place in the icon position pane labeled
      "undefined". When the sensor row is dropped on the label, it will display the sensor
      name.</p>

      <p>When all the active icons are assigned sensors, the <strong>Add to Panel</strong> button
      will become active and it can be pressed to install the MultiSensor onto the Panel.</p>
