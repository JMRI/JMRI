      <h1>Set Signals at Turnout</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tool provides an automated procedure for assigning
      signals to a turnout. Right-handed turnouts, left-handed
      turnouts, and wye turnouts are supported. If requested, this
      tool will place signal icons on the panel at the specified
      turnout, and will set up Simple Signal Logic for the
      specified signal heads. Prior to selecting this tool, the
      turnout must be on the panel, and the required signal heads
      must be in the Signal Head Table. This tool only places
      signal heads correctly when the main track of the turnout is
      vertical or horizontal (or mostly vertical or horizontal) on
      the panel, so design your panel accordingly.</p>

      <p>When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of
      the turnout name (system or user), and the names of the three
      or four signal heads to be assigned to the turnout. For each
      signal head, check boxes are available for selecting whether
      an icon is to be placed on the panel, and whether Simple
      Signal Logic is to be created for the signal head. Regardless
      of whether icons are placed or logic is created, Layout
      Editor will record that the entered signal heads are assigned
      to the specified turnout.</p>

      <p><b>Assigning signal heads to turnouts is important to
      completely describe your layout in Layout Editor.</b> Even if
      you elect to place your icons and set up your signal logic
      manually, you should use this tool to assign the signal heads
      to their turnout.</p>

      <h2>The Set Signals at Turnout Dialog</h2>

      <p>In the <b>Turnout Name</b> field, enter the name (system
      or user) of the turnout to which the signal heads will be
      assigned. If the tool cannot find the entered turnout on the
      panel, an error message results.</p>

      <p>Signal Head names (either system or user) are entered in
      the next section. The <b>Throat - Diverging</b> entry is
      optional, but the other three must be entered. If signal
      heads at this turnout have been entered previously, click
      <b>Get Saved</b> to retrieve the signal head names previously
      entered. The titles used for the four signal heads follow the
      model shown below.</p>

      <p><a href="./images/TurnoutSignalModel.gif"><img src=
      "./images/TurnoutSignalModel.gif" width="225"
      height="75" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a></p>

      <p>If a signal head is entered for <b>Throat - Diverging</b>,
      then <b>Throat - Continuing</b> signals the continuing track
      and <b>Throat - Diverging</b> signals the diverging track. If
      no signal head is entered for <b>Throat - Diverging</b>, the
      <b>Throat - Continuing</b> signal head reflects the state of
      whichever track the turnout is switched to. In that case, the
      logic type for the <b>Throat - Continuing</b> signal head is
      <b>On Facing-Point Turnout</b>.</p>

      <p>Note: If there was a signal head previously assigned to
      one of the two positions, and you enter a <i>different</i>
      signal head in the same place, the new signal head will
      replace the previous signal head, and the icon of the
      previous signal head (if there is one) will be deleted from
      the panel. Similarly, if you replace a previously assigned
      <b>Throat - Diverging</b> signal head with a blank entry (no
      signal head), the previous entry is deleted and the turnout
      will not have a signal head at that position. <b>If a signal
      head is changed, you must redo any logic that involves
      it.</b></p>

      <p>Check <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> to request that an
      icon for a signal head be placed on the panel at the turnout
      position indicated. This tool can only place a signal icon on
      a turnout that is almost vertical or almost horizontal. If
      this is not so, a message is printed, and you should place
      the signal icon manually using the Layout Editor tool bar.
      Regardless, the signal head name is assigned to the specified
      turnout position.</p>

      <p>Check <b>Set up Logic</b> to request that the tool set up
      a Simple Signal Logic for a signal head. The tool will create
      the logic and automatically fill in entries from the
      information available. If the tool does not have enough
      information available to set up the logic, a message results,
      and you will have to return later after more signals have
      been assigned to turnouts and block boundaries on the
      panel.</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <p>When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within
      a block until it finds a signal at the end of the block away
      from the turnout being signaled. If your layout contains
      sections that are signaled and sections that are not, to get
      this tool to set up logic correctly, you may have to place a
      virtual signal (a signal that does not correspond to an
      actual signal on the layout) at the unsignaled end of the
      block that connects a section of track that is signaled with
      track that is not signaled. If a block ends with an end
      bumper, no signal is required at the end bumper end.</p>

      <p>If a block has an internal turnout (the turnout, and the
      track segments at its throat and continuing legs are within
      the block), the program will expect signals at that turnout
      even if it's not at the end of the block. However, at times
      the user may not want to signal a seldom used turnout within
      a block. When following track through a block, the program
      will skip over unsignaled internal turnouts if <b>Skip
      Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</b> is checked in the Layout
      Editor <b>Tools</b> menu. It will always, however, warn that
      it is doing so. <b>Use this option with caution.</b> There is
      no signal protecting against a skipped turnout being set
      incorrectly, so if an unsignaled internal turnout is not set
      correctly, derailed trains could result.</p>

      <p>This tool sets up three-aspect signaling. If the diverging
      route through the turnout is not mainline track, limited
      speed (the least restrictive is not green, but yellow) is set
      up. If you have a special situation at a signal, you may have
      to edit the information entered by the tool. If you would
      like four-aspect signaling, you can easily manually edit the
      logic to achieve this. Similarly, by simple hand edits of the
      logic, you can add approach lighting. The Simple Signal Logic
      dialog can be accessed from the popup menu of the signal
      icon. If your special situation cannot be handled by Simple
      Signal Logic, you should refer to Logix to tailor the signal
      logic to your needs.</p>

      <p>If you are using two turnouts to represent a double-slip
      turnout, or if you are using two turnouts to represent a
      three-way turnout, the logic set up by this tool will not
      work correctly. For these two cases, you should use the
      <b>Set Signals at Throat-To-Throat Turnouts</b> or the <b>Set
      Signals at 3-Way Turnout</b> tools that are available in
      Layout Editor's <b>Tools</b> menu.</p>

      <p><b>Please remember to save your panel after using this
      tool.</b></p>
