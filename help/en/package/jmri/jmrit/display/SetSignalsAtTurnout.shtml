      <h1>Set Signals at Turnout</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tool provides an automated procedure for assigning signals to a turnout. Right-handed
      turnouts, left-handed turnouts, and wye turnouts are supported. If requested, this tool will
      place signal icons on the panel at the specified turnout, and will set up Simple Signal Logic
      for the specified signal heads. Prior to selecting this tool, the turnout must be on the
      panel, and the required signal heads must be in the Signal Head Table. This tool only places
      signal heads correctly when the main track of the turnout is vertical or horizontal (or
      mostly vertical or horizontal) on the panel, so design your panel accordingly.</p>

      <p>When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of the turnout name (system or
      user), and the names of the three or four signal heads to be assigned to the turnout. For
      each signal head, check boxes are available for selecting whether an icon is to be placed on
      the panel, and whether Simple Signal Logic is to be created for the signal head. Regardless
      of whether icons are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record that the entered
      signal heads are assigned to the specified turnout.</p>

      <p><strong>Assigning signal heads to turnouts is important to completely describe your layout
      in Layout Editor.</strong> Even if you elect to place your icons and set up your signal logic
      manually, you should use this tool to assign the signal heads to their turnout.</p>

      <h2>The Set Signals at Turnout Dialog</h2>

      <p>In the <strong>Turnout Name</strong> field, enter the name (system or user) of the turnout
      to which the signal heads will be assigned. If the tool cannot find the entered turnout on
      the panel, an error message results.</p>

      <p>Signal Head names (either system or user) are entered in the next section. The
      <strong>Throat - Diverging</strong> entry is optional, but the other three must be entered.
      If signal heads at this turnout have been entered previously, click <strong>Get
      Saved</strong> to retrieve the signal head names previously entered. The titles used for the
      four signal heads follow the model shown below.</p>

      <p><a href="./images/TurnoutSignalModel.gif"><img src="./images/TurnoutSignalModel.gif"
      width="225" height="75" alt="signals at turnout"></a>
      </p>

      <p>If a signal head is entered for <strong>Throat - Diverging</strong>, then <strong>Throat -
      Continuing</strong> signals the continuing track and <strong>Throat - Diverging</strong>
      signals the diverging track. If no signal head is entered for <strong>Throat -
      Diverging</strong>, the <strong>Throat - Continuing</strong> signal head reflects the state
      of whichever track the turnout is switched to. In that case, the logic type for the
      <strong>Throat - Continuing</strong> signal head is <strong>On Facing-Point
      Turnout</strong>.</p>

      <p>Note: If there was a signal head previously assigned to one of the two positions, and you
      enter a <em>different</em> signal head in the same place, the new signal head will replace
      the previous signal head, and the icon of the previous signal head (if there is one) will be
      deleted from the panel. Similarly, if you replace a previously assigned <strong>Throat -
      Diverging</strong> signal head with a blank entry (no signal head), the previous entry is
      deleted and the turnout will not have a signal head at that position. <strong>If a signal
      head is changed, you must redo any logic that involves it.</strong></p>

      <p>Check <strong>Add Signal Icon to Panel</strong> to request that an icon for a signal head
      be placed on the panel at the turnout position indicated. This tool can only place a signal
      icon on a turnout that is almost vertical or almost horizontal. If this is not so, a message
      is printed, and you should place the signal icon manually using the Layout Editor tool bar.
      Regardless, the signal head name is assigned to the specified turnout position.</p>

      <p>Check <strong>Set up Logic</strong> to request that the tool set up a Simple Signal Logic
      for a signal head. The tool will create the logic and automatically fill in entries from the
      information available. If the tool does not have enough information available to set up the
      logic, a message results, and you will have to return later after more signals have been
      assigned to turnouts and block boundaries on the panel.</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <p>When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within a block until it finds a signal
      at the end of the block away from the turnout being signaled. If your layout contains
      sections that are signaled and sections that are not, to get this tool to set up logic
      correctly, you may have to place a virtual signal (a signal that does not correspond to an
      actual signal on the layout) at the unsignaled end of the block that connects a section of
      track that is signaled with track that is not signaled. If a block ends with an end bumper,
      no signal is required at the end bumper end.</p>

      <p>If a block has an internal turnout (the turnout, and the track segments at its throat and
      continuing legs are within the block), the program will expect signals at that turnout even
      if it's not at the end of the block. However, at times the user may not want to signal a
      seldom used turnout within a block. When following track through a block, the program will
      skip over unsignaled internal turnouts if <strong>Skip Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</strong>
      is checked in the Layout Editor <strong>Tools</strong> menu. It will always, however, warn
      that it is doing so. <strong>Use this option with caution.</strong> There is no signal
      protecting against a skipped turnout being set incorrectly, so if an unsignaled internal
      turnout is not set correctly, derailed trains could result.</p>

      <p>This tool sets up three-aspect signaling. If the diverging route through the turnout is
      not mainline track, limited speed (the least restrictive is not green, but yellow) is set up.
      If you have a special situation at a signal, you may have to edit the information entered by
      the tool. If you would like four-aspect signaling, you can easily manually edit the logic to
      achieve this. Similarly, by simple hand edits of the logic, you can add approach lighting.
      The Simple Signal Logic dialog can be accessed from the popup menu of the signal icon. If
      your special situation cannot be handled by Simple Signal Logic, you should refer to Logix to
      tailor the signal logic to your needs.</p>

      <p>If you are using two turnouts to represent a double-slip turnout, or if you are using two
      turnouts to represent a three-way turnout, the logic set up by this tool will not work
      correctly. For these two cases, you should use the <strong>Set Signals at Throat-To-Throat
      Turnouts</strong> or the <strong>Set Signals at 3-Way Turnout</strong> tools that are
      available in Layout Editor's <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</p>

      <p><strong>Please remember to save your panel after using this tool.</strong>
