      <h2>Introduction to Layout Editor Panels</h2>

      <p>JMRI supports multiple panels, either Layout Editor type
      or Panel Editor type. All panels that have been created or
      loaded are listed in the submenu of <b>Show Panel</b> in the
      Panels menu. You can minimize or close a panel window, and
      bring it back as the front most window by selecting it in
      this submenu. Multiple monitors are supported to the extent
      that the operating system allows, and a single panel may be
      stretched to occupy more than one monitor.</p>

      <p>To save your Layout Editor panel, select <b>Save
      Panels...</b> in the <b>File</b> menu of your Layout Editor
      panel, or in the Panels menu. When you do this, all panels
      listed in the submenu of <b>Show Panel</b> are saved, along
      with all shared configuration items (sensors, turnouts,
      signal heads, etc.). To make it easier to save your panel
      often, Layout Editor provides the menu item, <b>Save Location
      and Size</b>, in the <b>Options</b> menu. Once you have sized
      and positioned your panel exactly as you would like it to
      come up when loaded, select this item and save your panel.
      You need not be concerned about the position and size of your
      panel changing during subsequent saves! The position and size
      of your panel will only change when you select <b>Save
      Location and Size</b>. So save your panel often to preserve
      your work.</p>

      <p><b>Layout Editor</b> supports the construction and display
      of PanelPro panels. <b>Layout Editor</b> is similar to the
      traditional PanelPro <b>Panel Editor</b>, except it supports
      a drawn track diagram instead of an icon-based track diagram.
      Because of the way it works, <b>Layout Editor</b> captures
      the full connectivity of your layout as you draw it. Several
      automated tools are available to make setting up your panel
      easier.</p>

      <p><b>Layout Editor</b> is implemented using a tool bar at
      the top (default location) of your panel. This tool bar may be switched on and
      off using the <b>Edit Mode</b> item in your panel's
      <b>Options</b> menu. When you create a new Layout Editor
      panel, your new panel appears with the Edit Mode tool bar
      displayed at the top of your panel, and with a
      system-specific help bar displayed at the bottom of the
      panel. The help bar describes how to use the <b>Layout
      Editor</b> user interface. The help bar probably should be
      turned off (using the Options menu) once you are familiar
      with the user interface.</p>

      <p><b>Layout Editor</b> supports several options that you may
      or may not elect to use when you draw your track diagram.
      Sections of track may be designated as <i>mainline track</i>
      to differentiate it from <i>side track</i> (the default).
      Mainline track and side track may be drawn with different
      width lines. You may divide your layout into <i>blocks</i>,
      with each block having an occupancy sensor and each drawn
      with different track colors for occupied and unoccupied
      states, allowing the track in a block to change color as a
      train enters and leaves that block. Normally track segments
      are drawn as solid lines, but you can designate chosen
      segments as <i>dashed</i> to show tunnels or tracks crossing
      at different grades. You can also designate a track segment
      as <i>hidden</i> so it is displayed only when the tool bar is
      shown. These options may be set up as you draw your panel, or
      you may add them later.</p>

      <p>Below is a short tutorial on the basics of using Layout
      Editor. A more complete tutorial is available for download as
      a pdf file on the JMRI web site. See <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/community/clinics/NMRA2008/index.html"><b>Using
      the JMRI/PanelPro Layout Editor</b></a> and its two
      associated demonstration .xml files. <a name="start" id=
      "start"></a></p>

      <h2>Getting Started with Layout Editor</h2>

      <p>To get familiar with the Layout Editor user interface, try
      the following:</p>

      <p>1. Select <b>New panel...</b>, then <b>Layout Editor</b>
      in the Panels menu. You should see a blank panel window with
      a tool bar at the top, and a help bar at the bottom.</p>

      <p>2. Move the cursor around inside the blank panel. Note
      that as you move, coordinates are displayed at the upper left
      of the tool bar--<i>x</i> (horizontal) and <i>y</i>
      (vertical). (This is to aid in aligning items as you draw
      them.) Move the cursor over the radio buttons, check boxes and
      entry fields in the tool bar, noting that each has a tool tip.</p>

      <p>3. To add a right-handed turnout, first, select RH for Turnout
      Type in the top row of the tool bar. Then, while depressing the
      shift key, click the mouse (left click on a two-button mouse) on a
      point about one third down and one third across from the upper
      left of your panel. A right-handed turnout should appear. The
      three <strong><span style="color:red">red</span></strong> squares
      at the ends of the throat and the continuing and diverging legs of
      the turnout are connection points for <b>Track Segments</b>. The
      round circle at the center of the turnout is where you should
      point to get the turnout's popup menu.</p>

      <p>4. To add a left-handed turnout, first, select LH for
      turnout type. (Note that the selection is automatically turned
      off at RH.) Type "180" in the Rotation box at the upper right
      of the tool bar, to rotate the new turnout. While pressing
      the shift key, click the mouse on a point at the same height
      as the other turnout, but to the right about two or three
      inches. A left-handed turnout should appear with its throat
      facing away from the right-handed turnout.</p>

      <p>5. To add track segments to connect the two turnouts,
      select Track Segment on the second row of the tool bar. While
      holding the shift key down the whole time, depress the mouse
      button on the diverging connection point of one turnout, and
      drag to the diverging connection point of the other turnout,
      and release the mouse button when the cursor changes shape.
      You should see a track segment connecting the two turnouts,
      and both connection points should change color to
      <strong><span style="color:green">green</span></strong>,
      indicating they are <i>full</i>, that is they have the
      maximum number of connections allowed. Similarly press and
      drag with shift pressed to add a track segment connecting the
      continuing legs of the two turnouts. You've drawn a passing
      siding.</p>

      <p>6. To add a turnout for an industry siding, select LH for a
      left-handed turnout, and enter 0 in Rotation. Then with shift
      pressed, click on a point a couple of inches below and
      slightly to the right of the turnout on your left.</p>

      <p>7. To connect this turnout with the upper passing track and
      form a simple oval track diagram, select Anchor Point on the third
      row of the tool bar. An <b>Anchor Point</b> is a node in a track
      diagram that can accept two connecting track segments; it's used
      to place connected track segments so that they look reasonably
      nice (and also to divide blocks). While holding shift down, click
      on a point exactly to the left of the turnout on your upper left,
      and again on a point directly below this one, but exactly to the
      left of the lower turnout. Next click on a point about 1/2 inch to
      the left and 1/2 inch below the upper anchor point, and again on a
      point 1/2 inch to the left and 1/2 inch above the lower anchor
      point. You should now have four anchor points outlining the left
      side of the oval. Connect these four points and the turnout throat
      connection points with track segments--select Track Segment, then
      with shift pressed, click and drag to create each of the five
      track segments needed. Note that the anchor point rectangle will
      change from <strong><span style="color:red">red</span></strong> to
      <strong><span style="color:green">green</span></strong> when it
      has two connections. Similarly repeat this procedure to draw the
      right side of the oval.</p>

      <p>8. Turnout positions and anchor point positions may be
      adjusted to make the track diagram look nice by holding down
      the meta key (check the help bar to see which key is the meta
      key), and dragging each anchor point or turnout. To adjust
      the position of a turnout, drag the center point of the
      turnout with the meta key pressed.</p>

      <p>9. Next complete the industry siding. The diverging connection
      point of the lower turnout should be the only box needing a
      connection (colored <strong><span
      style="color:red">red</span></strong>). Select End Bumper in the
      tool bar. An <b>End Bumper</b> is a node in a track diagram that
      can accept only one connection. With shift pressed, click on a
      point exactly to the right of the diverging connection point of
      the lower turnout. Connect your end bumper to the diverging
      connection point by holding shift down, while pressing the mouse
      button on the diverging connection point and dragging to the end
      bumper. Your track diagram should look like the following:</p>

      <p><a href="./images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif"><img src=
      "./images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif" align="middle" width="563"
      height="169" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt=
      "Oval Layout Image"></a></p>

      <p>10. Select <b>Edit Mode</b> in the Options menu to hide
      the tool bar (and the help bar) and see how your track
      diagram of a simple oval layout would look in a final panel.
      You should see connection points and edit circles disappear.
      Also note that, when not in Edit Mode, items may not be
      repositioned and popup menus are not active.</p>

      <p>The above steps demonstrated the basic steps needed to
      draw a track diagram. You can clear this demonstration panel
      by selecting <b>Delete this panel...</b> in the panel's File
      menu, and begin to construct a track diagram of your layout.
      Read the items below to learn more about how to add content
      to track diagram items and how to add icon items to your
      panel.</p>

      <p><b>Note: Layout Editor tools for placing signal heads and
      automatically configuring signal logic require that turnouts
      and block boundaries (see below) be oriented vertically or
      horizontally on your panel.</b> To make maximum use of these
      tools, design your panel with turnouts oriented vertically or
      horizontally (the orientation does not have to be exact, just
      mostly vertical or mostly horizontal).</p>

      <a name="toolbar" id="toolbar"></a>
      <h2>Using the Layout Editor Tool Bar</h2>

      <p>The tool bar is used to add items to a panel, and to
      provide information for the items added. The item to be added
      is selected using one of the following radio buttons in the tool
      bar:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>RH</b> - selects a right-handed turnout</li>

        <li><b>LH</b> - selects a left-handed turnout</li>

        <li><b>WYE</b> - selects a wye turnout</li>

        <li><b>Double X-over</b> - selects a double crossover
        turnout</li>

        <li><b>RH X-over</b> - selects a right-handed single
        crossover turnout</li>

        <li><b>LH X-over</b> - selects a left-handed single
        crossover turnout</li>

        <li><b>Single Slip</b> - selects a single
        slip turnout</li>

        <li><b>Double Slip</b> - selects a double
        slip turnout</li>

        <li><b>Level Crossing</b> - selects a level crossing track
        (a diamond)</li>

        <li><b>Track Segment</b> - selects a piece of connecting track</li>

        <li><b>End Bumper</b> - selects a connection point at the
        end of a track</li>

        <li><b>Anchor Point</b> - selects a connection point
        between two track segments</li>

        <li><b>Edge Connector</b> - selects a connection point
        between two track segments on different panels</li>

        <li><b>Text Label</b> - selects a label showing the content
        of the entry field</li>

        <li><b>Memory</b> - selects a label showing the
        contents of the memory whose name is entered on the
        right</li>

        <li><b>Block Contents</b> - selects a label showing the
        contents of the block whose name is entered</li>

        <li><b>Multi-sensor</b> - selects a multi-sensor--A dialog
        is displayed allowing the multi-sensor to be defined.
        Before creating the multi-sensor, a name must be entered
        for every sensor to define the multi-sensor
        completely.</li>

        <li><b>Sensor Icon</b> - selects a sensor icon showing the
        sensor whose name is entered on the right.</li>

        <li><b>Signal Icon</b> - selects a signal head icon showing
        the signal head whose name is entered on the right</li>

        <li><b>Signal Mast Icon</b> - selects a signal mast icon
        showing the signal mast whose name is entered on the
        right</li>

        <li><b>Icon Label</b> - selects a general purpose icon</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The top 13 items are used to create a track diagram, and
      are new with Layout Editor. The remaining eight items are
      icon-based and are similar to corresponding icon items in
      Panel Editor.</p>

      <p>To add all items except Track Segment:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select its check box (check boxes of the other items
        will automatically be deselected).</li>

        <li>Enter any other information needed (see below).</li>

        <li>Move the mouse cursor to the point on the panel where
        you would like the item to appear.</li>

        <li>Hold down the shift key.</li>

        <li>Click the mouse (left-click).</li>

        <li>Release the mouse, and then release the shift key.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>A Track Segment is a piece of track connecting two connection
      points (<strong><span style="color:red">red</span></strong>
      squares on a turnout, anchor point, end bumper, edge connector,
      turnout's, crossover's, or level crossing). Before you can add a
      Track Segment, two <strong><span
      style="color:red">red</span></strong> connection points must be
      visible on the panel. To add a Track Segment connecting two
      <strong><span style="color:red">red</span></strong> connection
      points:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select the Track Segment radio button in the tool
        bar.</li>

        <li>Enter any other information--all optional (see
        below).</li>

        <li>Hold down the shift key.</li>

        <li>Press and hold down the mouse on either of the
        connection points.</li>

        <li>Drag the mouse to the other connection point. The
        cursor shape changes when you're there.</li>

        <li>Release the mouse, and then release the shift key.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Check boxes and fields on the tool bar other than the
      21 enumerated above are for entering information that
      will be applied to created items as they are created. Some
      information is required, and some is optional. Optional
      things may be added or changed later using an item's popup
      menu, but it's sometimes easier to add them as items are
      created. Required items are tightly linked to created items
      and may not be changed later without removing and recreating
      the item. Each information entry has a tool tip that explains
      what it does; hover the mouse cursor over a field or check
      box to see its tool tip. Information entries are described
      below, along with which created items they apply to and
      whether they are optional or required.</p>

      <p></p><span class="since">Since 4.7.3</span>
      Most of the toolbar's options are set using <b>combo boxes</b>.
      A <b>combo box</b> combines a <b>text field</b>
      with a <b>drop down list</b>. You may ether type text into the
      <b>text field</b> or select an item from the <b>drop down list</b>.
      Selecting an item from the <b>drop down list</b> will copy it
      into the <b>text field</b> where you may edit it.
      </p>
      <p>
      Note: Toolbar <b>Combo boxes</b> are color coded! If you enter the name of an
      existing item then the background color of the <b>combo box</b> will turn
      <strong><span style="background-color: #BDECB6">green</span></strong>.
      If the item doesn't match the name of an existing item then the
      background will ether turn
      <strong><span style="background-color: #FDFD96">yellow</span></strong>
      if a new item with that name will be created or
      <strong><span style="background-color: #FFC0C0">red</span></strong>
      if that name can not be used.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Combo boxes</b> that are not applicable for the currently
      selected edit toolbar item are disabled.
      </p>

        JMRI system name (with IM prefixed if needed).</li>

        <li><b>Block Contents</b> (ComboBox) - applies to Block
        Contents - Entry is required. If the entered name doesn't
        correspond to a layout block a new memory layout block will
        be created, using the entered name as the JMRI system name
        (with a prefix added if needed). This new block will be
        discarded on the next save of the Layout unless it is
        actually used.</li>

        <li><b>Sensor Icon</b> (ComboBox) - applies to Sensor Icon -
        Entry is required. If a sensor with the entered name does
        not exist, it will be created using the entered name as the
        JMRI system name (with a suitable prefix if needed).</li>

        <li><b>Signal Mast Icon</b> (ComboBox) - applies to Signal Mast Icon -
        Entry is required. If a signal mast with the entered name
        is not in the Signal Mast Table, an error message results,
        and the Signal Mast Icon is not created. <b>Note: To
        automatically associate signal masts with turnouts and
        block boundaries, you should use the automated tools in the
        Tools menu to place signal mast icons.</b> This item is provided
        for those cases where those automated tools cannot place a
        signal mast icon where needed.</li>

        <li><b>Signal Head Icon</b> (ComboBox) - applies to Signal Head Icon -
        Entry is required. If a signal head with the entered name
        is not in the Signal Head Table, an error message results,
        and the Signal Head Icon is not created. <b>Note: To
        automatically associate signal heads with turnouts and
        block boundaries, you should use the automated tools in the
        Tools menu to place signal head icons.</b> This item is provided
        for those cases where those automated tools cannot place a
        signal head icon where needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When pressed, the <b>Change Icons...</b> button on the
      tool bar brings up an icon editor for either sensor icons,
      signal mast icons, signal head icons, or general purpose icons,
      depending upon whether <b>Sensor Icon</b>, <b>Signal Mast Icon</b>,
      <b>Signal Head Icon</b>, or <b>Icon Label</b> is checked in the toolbar.
      If none of these items is checked, the menu choice is ignored.
      For Signal Mast Icons and Signal Head Icons, the Layout Editor
      defaults to the left-facing short icons found at
      "resources/icons/smallschematics/searchlights/". If you are
      using a black background you may need to switch to white
      icons that are available in the same area, since the default
      icons have black borders.</p>

      <h2>Using the Layout Editor Floating Toolbox</h2>
      <span class="since">since 4.7.2</span>

      <p>The classic toolbar resides to the top or side of the panel. The
      <b>toolbox</b> floats on the screen and can be moved around. It provides
      all of the same functions as the toolbar.</p>

      <p>The radio buttons, checkboxes, combo boxes and labels are grouped
      together on 4 tabs:  <b>Turnouts</b>, <b>Track</b>, <b>Labels</b> and
      <b>Icons</b>. Below the tab section is a line that displays the current
      zoom factor and cursor location.  The title bar includes the name
      of the related panel.</p>

      <p>Since the Toolbox is a standard window, it contains the Close
	  and Minimize buttons. The Close button <b><em>hides</em></b> the toolbox,
      it does not delete it. To show it again, select the toolbox name
	  from the <b>Window</b> menu. The minimize button behaves in the
	  traditional manner with the toolbox becoming an icon on the operating system task
	  bar.  Use the Window menu or click on the task bar icon to make it
	  visible.

      <h2>Using a Panel's File Menu</h2>

      <p>The File menu provides for storing and deleting
      panels.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Save Panels...</b> - When this item is selected, a
        Save dialog is shown. When Save is selected in the Save
        dialog, all layout configuration information is written to
        disk, including information for all panels, Layout
        Editor, Control Panel Editor and Panel Editor types, and all non-panel
        specific layout configuration items (e.g., turnouts,
        sensors, lights, signal heads, routes, logixs, blocks,
        etc.) <b>Store panels...</b> is available in the File menu
        of each panel, and in the Panels menu. It can also be
        reached by selecting <b>Store Configuration And Panels To
        File...</b> in the Store submenu of the File menu of any
        table.</li>

        <li><b>Delete this Panel...</b> - This item deletes the
        front most panel. A confirmation dialog is displayed,
        allowing the choice of canceling before deleting. Deletion
        removes the panel from the program. To permanently delete a
        panel from your panel file, <b>Store panels...</b> must be
        selected after deleting that panel. <b>There is no undo for
        deletion.</b> Unless the panel has been saved to disk, it
        is gone after deletion.</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="option" id="option"></a>
      <h2>Using Layout Editor's Options Menu</h2>

      <p>The Options menu is used to set options, add items to the
      panel, and perform operations that do not happen very often
      during panel creation. Each Option menu selection is
      described below.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Edit Mode</b> - When this item is checked, the toolbar
        is displayed based on the <b>ToolBar Side</b> selection, and the track
        diagram displays connection points and edit circles.
        Uncheck <b>Edit Mode</b> to hide the toolbar and the help bar if
        it is displayed.</li>

        <li>
	      <b>ToolBar</b> - This sub-menu controls the Toolbar characteristics.
	      It contains the following options: <span class="since">since 4.7.2</span>

          <ul>
            <li><b>ToolBar Side...</b> - Set the location of the
            toolbar.  The choices are Top, Left, Bottom and Right.
            A fifth choice, <b>Float</b>, replaces
            the normal tool bar with a floating toolbox.
            </li>

            <li><b>Wide ToolBar</b> - The Top and Bottom tool bars change
             their height and width based on screen size.  If this option
             is enabled, the wide version will be used.  This can result
             in the toolbar using a horizontal scroll bar.</li>

            <li><b>Drop Down Lists Display Order...</b> - Choose which names,
            <b>user</b> and/or <b>system</b>, to use for the combo boxes.  This also
            determines the sort order</li>

          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Allow Repositioning</b> - When this item is checked,
        items on the panel can be repositioned by dragging on the
        item with the meta key pressed. Track diagram items and
        icon-based items can only be repositioned when Edit Mode is
        checked. Markers are an exception; markers may be
        repositioned at any time irrespective of whether Edit Mode
        and/or Allow Repositioning are checked.</li>

        <li><b>Allow Layout Control</b> - When this item is
        checked, clicking on active turnout items in the track
        diagram or on active icon items, such as sensor icons, and
        signal icons, will toggle the state of the represented
        item.</li>

        <li><b>Allow Turnout Animation</b> - When this item is
        checked, turnouts on the track diagram will change to show
        turnout state. If this item is not checked, turnout
        drawings will show the Closed position at all times.</li>

        <li><b>Show Help Bar in Edit Mode</b> - If this item is
        checked, the help bar is displayed when the tool bar is
        displayed.</li>

        <li><b>Show Grid in Edit Mode</b> - If this item is
        checked, a background grid is displayed in edit mode.</li>

        <li><b>Snap to Grid when Adding</b> - If this item is
        checked, when an item is added to the panel, its
        coordinates are constrained to grid points. For track
        diagram items (turnouts, anchor points, end bumpers, edge
        connectors and level crossings, the coordinates of center
        points are constrained to grid points. For icons and
        labels, the coordinates of upper left corners are
        constrained to grid points.</li>

        <li><b>Snap to Grid when Moving</b> - If this item is
        checked, when an item is moved on the panel, its
        coordinates are constrained to grid points. For track
        diagram items (turnouts, anchor points, end bumpers, edge
        connectors, and level crossings), the coordinates of center
        points are constrained to grid points. If connection points
        of turnouts or level crossings are moved, their coordinates
        are also constrained to grid points. For icons and labels,
        the coordinates of upper left corners are constrained to
        grid points.</li>

        <li><b>Grid Size...</b>Change the size of the grid.  The
        default size is 10.</li>

        <li><b>Panel scrollbars</b> - This sub-menu allows you to
        choose which scrollbars to display. You can still pan the
        display by holding down the left mouse button and dragging
        outside the window in the direction you want to pan. The
        scrollbars are always enabled during edit mode.</li>

        <li><b>Show Icon tooltips</b> - This submenu allows you to
        select whether icon tooltips are displayed when in Edit
        Mode and when not in Edit Mode. When the mouse is hovered
        over an icon, and tooltips are on, the name of the icon is
        displayed while the mouse remains over the icon. Drawn
        track items do not have tooltips.</li>

        <li><b>Enable antialiasing (Smoother lines)</b> - If this
        item is selected, the panel is displayed (rendered) with
        antialiasing enabled. Antialiasing smoothes out lines in
        the drawn panel, but it does take longer to refresh the
        panel. Check antialiasing for a better looking panel.
        Uncheck antialiasing for faster refresh.</li>

        <li><b>Highlight Selected Block</b> - Selecting this item
        enables block highighting while in edit mode.  When a block
        is selected in the block name combo box, the track components
        assigned to that block are changed to use the alternate
        track color.  This is used to verify that blocks are valid.
        This generally means that there are no block gaps</li>

        <li><b>New Title...</b> - Selecting this item brings up a
        small window that allows a new panel window title to be
        entered.</li>

        <li><b>Add Background Image...</b> - Selecting this item
        shows a dialog that allows a background image to be added
        to the panel. See <a href="#background">Backgrounds</a>
        below for more information.</li>

        <li><b>Add Fast Clock</b> - Selecting this item adds an
        analog fast clock at the upper left. You can then drag it
        with the meta key pressed to any location on the
        panel.</li>

        <li><b>Add Turntable</b> - Selecting this item adds a
        turntable to the panel at the center of the panel. You can
        then drag it with the meta key pressed to any location on
        the panel.</li>

        <li><b>Add Reporter Label...</b> - Selecting this item
        brings up a dialog that allows entry of a Reporter name
        (system name or user name) and x, y coordinates of where
        the label is to be placed initially. The x,y coordinates
        apply to the upper left corner of the label. To create a
        Reporter Label, enter the name and coordinates, then click
        <b>Add New Label</b>. After a label is added the Add
        Reporter Label window remains open to allow entry of more
        Reporter Labels. To close the window, click <b>Cancel</b>
        or use the close button at the top.</li>

        <li><b>Save Location and Size</b> - When this item is
        selected, the current panel window size and location
        replace the default size and location of the panel window.
        If the panel is saved to disk after this item is selected,
        when the panel is reloaded its window will have the size
        and location saved when this item was selected, provided
        the computer operating system permits a window with that
        size and location.</li>

        <li><b>Set Track Line Width...</b> - Selecting this item brings
        up a dialog that allows entry of a width for mainline track
        and a width for side track. All mainline track and all side
        track in the track diagram will use the new values. (See
        below for more information on types of track.)</li>

        <li><b>Set Default Track Colors</b> - This item's submenu
        allows one of thirteen colors to be selected as the <b>Default
        Track Color</b>, the <b>Default Occupied Color</b> and the
        <b>Default Alternative Track Color</b>.  When a track component
        is added it will have the default track color.  If the track
        component is added with a block name assigned and the block has
        been used before, it will inherit the existing block colors.
        If this is the first track component for this block, the new
        layout block will be assigned all three colors.  The default
        track color is also used for lines of the selection rectangle.</li>

        <li><b>Set Default Text Color</b> - This item's submenu
        allows one of thirteen colors to be selected as the default
        text color.</li>

        <li>
          <b>Turnout Options</b> - This sub-menu controls the look
          of turnouts on the panel. Contains:

          <ul>
            <li><b>Show Turnout Circles</b> - When this item is
            checked, circles at the center of turnouts are shown
            when not in Edit Mode. Turnout circles are always shown
            when in Edit Mode. When not in Edit Mode, turnout
            circles can be useful if you are toggling turnouts by
            clicking on them.</li>

            <li><b>Turnout Circle Colors</b> - Sets the color of
            the turnout circle. Default is to use the Default Track
            Color.</li>

            <li><b>Turnout Circle Size</b> - Sets the relative size
            of the turnout circle.</li>

            <li><b>Draw Unselected Turnout Leg</b> - When on, draws
            the unselected leg of each turnout. When off, this leg
            is not drawn. This makes the turnout position more
            visible when the diverging angle is small.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Automatically Assign Blocks to Track</b> - A block is created
        for each piece of track as it is added.  The generated block names
        are <b>AUTOBLK:n</b> where n is a number.</li>

        <li><b>Hide Track Construction Lines</b> - Some track objects create
        construction lines.  This mainly applieds to curved track.  If this
        option is enabled, then those lines are not displayed,</li>

        <li><b>Use Direct Turnout Control</b> - If enabled and edit mode
        is not active, then the left mouse button sets a turnout closed and
        the right mouse button sets the turnout thrown.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Using Layout Editor's Tools Menu</h2>

      <p>The <b>Tools</b> menu provides tools to aid in creation and
      editing of Layout Editor panels. Using these automated
      procedures should reduce the time and effort needed to create
      your panel. Note: <b>Set Signals</b> tools only work
      correctly if turnouts and block boundaries are oriented
      mostly vertically or mostly horizontally.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Scale/Translate Track Diagram...</b> - Selecting
        this item brings up a dialog that allows scaling and
        translation of the track diagram. (For more information on
        this item, see the help page for that dialog.)</li>

        <li><b>Translate Selection...</b> - Prior to selecting this
        item, the user must select an area on the panel. To select
        an area, press the mouse button (left button) with the
        cursor at the upper left of the area, and drag to the lower
        right of the area. With a selection active, selecting this
        item brings up a dialog that allows translation of the
        selected area. (For more information on this item, see the
        help page for that dialog.)</li>

        <li><b>Undo Translate Selection</b> - Selecting this item
        automatically reverses the previous <b>Translate
        Selection...</b>. Only one level of undo is supported. If a
        selection has not been translated, this item is
        ignored.</li>

        <li><b>Use Program Default Turnout Size</b> - Selecting
        this item sets default sizes of new turnouts to Layout
        Editor program defaults, canceling any changes to turnout
        default sizes that may have been made. See <a href=
        "#turnouts">Turnouts</a> for more information on turnout
        sizes.</li>

        <li><b>Skip Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</b> - When setting
        up signal logic, Layout Editor's <b>Set Signals ...</b>
        tools (described below) will follow track within a block
        until it finds a signal or a place where they expect to
        find a signal. If the expected signal is absent, a message
        is sent and the logic is not set up. If a block has an
        internal turnout (the turnout, and the track segments at
        its throat and continuing legs are within the block), the
        tools will expect signals at that turnout even if it's not
        at the end of the block. However, at times the user may not
        want to signal a seldom used turnout within a block. When
        following track through a block, the program will skip over
        unsignaled internal turnouts if this item, <b>Skip
        Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</b>, is checked. It will
        always, however, warn that it is doing so. <b>Use this
        option with caution.</b> There is no signal protecting
        against a skipped turnout being set incorrectly, so if an
        unsignaled internal turnout is not set correctly, derailed
        trains could result.</li>

        <li><b>Set Signals at Turnout...</b> - This item provides
        an automated procedure for assigning signals to a turnout.
        Right-handed turnouts, left-handed turnouts, and wye
        turnouts are supported. Prior to accessing this item, the
        turnout must be on the panel, and the required signal heads
        must be in the Signal Head Table. When this item is
        selected, a dialog is shown for entry of the turnout name
        (system or user), and the names of the three or four signal
        heads to be placed around the turnout. For each signal
        head, check boxes are available for selecting whether an
        icon is to be placed on the panel, and whether Simple
        Signal Logic is to be created for the signal head.
        Regardless of whether icons are placed or logic is created,
        Layout Editor will record that the entered signal heads are
        assigned to the entered turnout. This tool may not have
        enough information to create logic when it is first
        invoked, so you may have to return to it later after all
        signals have been assigned and after blocks have been
        defined for signaled regions of track on the panel. After a
        turnout has been assigned to the turnout drawing, this tool
        can be reached by selecting <b>Set Signals...</b> in that
        turnout's popup menu. (For more information, see the help
        page for the Set Signals at Turnout dialog.)</li>

        <li><b>Set Signals at Block Boundary...</b> - This item
        provides an automated procedure for assigning signals to a
        block boundary not associated with a turnout or a level
        crossing. Prior to accessing this item, blocks must be
        defined for signaled regions of track on the panel, and the
        required signal heads must be in the Signal Head Table.
        When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of
        names of the two blocks whose boundary is to be signaled,
        and for entry of names (system or user) of one or two
        signal heads to be assigned to the block boundary. For each
        signal head, check boxes are available for selecting
        whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and whether
        Simple Signal Logic is to be created for the signal head.
        Regardless of whether icons are placed or logic is created,
        Layout Editor will record that the entered signal heads are
        assigned to the specified block boundary. If create logic
        is requested and the tool does not have enough information
        available to set up the logic, you may have to return later
        after more signals have been assigned. After an anchor
        point is recognized as a block boundary, this tool can be
        reached by selecting <b>Set Signals...</b> in that anchor
        point's popup menu. (For more information, see the help
        page for the Set Signals at Block Boundary dialog.)</li>

        <li><b>Set Signals at Crossover...</b> - This item provides
        an automated procedure for assigning signals at a crossover
        turnout. It also provides for placing signal heads around
        the crossover and for setting up logic for those signals.
        Prior to accessing this item, blocks must be defined for
        signaled regions of track on the panel, and the required
        signal heads must be in the Signal Head Table. When this
        item is selected, a small dialog is shown for entry of the
        name (system or user) of the crossover turnout to be
        signaled. The entered name must correspond to a double
        crossover, a right-handed crossover, or a left-handed
        crossover. (If this tool is accessed by selecting <b>Set
        Signals...</b> in a turnout's popup menu, the turnout name
        is entered automatically.) After the crossover turnout is
        identified, a dialog is displayed for entry of names
        (system or user) of four to eight signal heads to be
        assigned to the crossover. For each signal head, check
        boxes are available for selecting whether an icon is to be
        placed on the panel, and whether signal logic is to be
        created for the signal head. Regardless of whether icons
        are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record
        that the entered signal heads are assigned to the specified
        turnout. If create logic is requested and the tool does not
        have enough information available to set up the logic, you
        may have to return later after more signals have been
        assigned. After a turnout from the Turnout Table is
        assigned to a crossover, this tool can be reached by
        selecting <b>Set Signals...</b> in that turnout's popup
        menu. (For more information, see the help page for the Set
        Signals at Crossover dialog.)</li>

        <li><b>Set Signals at Level Crossing...</b> - This item
        provides an automated procedure for assigning signals at a
        level crossing (a diamond). It also provides for placing
        signal heads around the level crossing and for setting up
        logic for those signals. Prior to accessing this tool,
        blocks must be defined for signaled regions of track on the
        panel, and the required signal heads must be in the Signal
        Head Table. This tool works best if the level crossing also
        serves as the boundary between two blocks in each signaled
        direction. When this item is selected, a dialog is shown
        for entry of one or two block names that uniquely identify
        the level crossing to be signaled, and for entry of names
        (system or user) of two or four signal heads to be arrayed
        around the level crossing. For each signal head, check
        boxes are available for selecting whether an icon is to be
        placed on the panel, and whether Simple Signal Logic is to
        be created for the signal head. Regardless of whether icons
        are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record
        that the entered signal heads are assigned to the specified
        level crossing. If create logic is requested and the tool
        does not have enough information available to set up the
        logic, you may have to return later after more signals have
        been assigned. After blocks have been assigned to the level
        crossing tracks, this tool can be reached by selecting
        <b>Set Signals...</b> in that level crossing's popup menu.
        (For more information, see the help page for the Set
        Signals at Level Crossing dialog.)</li>

        <li><b>Set Signals at Throat-to-Throat Turnouts...</b> -
        This item provides an automated procedure for assigning
        signals to two turnouts in close proximity oriented
        throat-to-throat, with the throats connected by a single
        track segment. This arrangement is used where four tracks
        come together in a small area, so closely that no signals
        are placed at the turnout throats. Such a setup is used to
        model a double-slip turnout, for example, but can also
        occur in other contexts. Each of the two turnouts may be
        either right-hand (RH), left-hand (LH), or wye (WYE)
        turnouts. This tool provides for placing signal heads at
        the continuing and diverging tracks of the two turnouts. It
        also provides for setting up logic for those signals. Prior
        to accessing this item, blocks must be defined for signaled
        regions of track on the panel, and the required signal
        heads must be in the Signal Head Table. When this item is
        selected, a dialog is shown for entry of the names (system
        or user) of the two turnouts to be signaled, and for entry
        of names (system or user) of four to eight signal heads to
        be assigned. For each signal head, check boxes are
        available for selecting whether a signal head icon is to be
        placed on the panel, and whether signal logic is to be
        created for the signal head. Regardless of whether icons
        are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record
        that the entered signal heads are assigned to the specified
        turnouts, and that the two turnouts are linked in a special
        throat-to-throat configuration. If create logic is
        requested and the tool does not have enough information
        available to set up the logic, you may have to return later
        after more signals have been assigned. The first time it is
        used for each throat-to-throat setup, this tool must be
        invoked from the Tools menu. After Layout Editor has
        recorded that the two turnouts are linked in a special
        throat-to-throat configuration, selecting <b>Set
        Signals...</b> in the popup menu of either turnout will
        bring up this tool with both turnouts identified. (For more
        information, see the help page for the Set Signals at
        Throat-to-Throat Turnouts dialog.)</li>

        <li><b>Set Signals at a Slip</b> - This item provides an
        automated procedure for assigning signals at a single or
        double slip It also provides for placing signal heads
        around the level crossing and for setting up logic for
        those signals. Prior to accessing this item, blocks must be
        defined for signaled regions of track on the panel, and the
        required signal heads must be in the Signal Head Table.
        When this item is selected, a drop down box is shown that
        lists the slips that have been defined on the panel to be
        signaled, and dialog boxes for entry of names (system or
        user) of four to eight signal heads to be assigned. For
        each signal head, check boxes are available for selecting
        whether a signal head icon is to be placed on the panel,
        and whether signal logic is to be created for the signal
        head. Regardless of whether icons are placed or logic is
        created, Layout Editor will record that the entered signal
        heads are assigned to the specified turnouts. If create
        logic is requested and the tool does not have enough
        information available to set up the logic, you may have to
        return later after more signals have been assigned. After
        blocks have been assigned to the a slip, this tool can be
        reached by selecting <b>Set Signals...</b> in the slips
        popup menu. (For more information, see the help page for
        the Set Signals at a Slip dialog.)</li>

        <li><b>Set Signals at 3-Way Turnout...</b> - This item
        provides an automated procedure for assigning signals to
        two turnouts used to model a 3-way turnout in Layout
        Editor. A 3-way turnout is modeled by using two turnouts,
        usually one right-hand and one left-hand, oriented so that
        the throat of the second turnout is connected to the
        continuing track of the first turnout by a very short Track
        Segment. This tool provides an automated procedure for
        assigning signal heads, placing them on the layout, and
        automatically creating signal logic for a 3-way turnout
        modeled in this way. This tool can also be used to place
        signal heads and set logic for two real turnouts that are
        configured as described above, where the user does not want
        to put signals between the two turnouts--essentially two
        real left-handed or right-handed turnouts that simulate a
        3-way turnout. Each of the two turnouts may be either
        right-hand (RH) or left-hand (LH). Prior to accessing this
        item, blocks must be defined for signaled regions of track
        on the panel, and the required signal heads must be in the
        Signal Head Table. When this item is selected, a dialog is
        shown for entry of the names (system or user) of the two
        turnouts comprising the 3-way turnout to be signaled, and
        for entry of names (system or user) of six (or four) signal
        heads to be assigned. For each signal head, check boxes are
        available for selecting whether a signal head icon is to be
        placed on the panel, and whether signal logic is to be
        created for the signal head. Regardless of whether icons
        are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record
        that the entered signal heads are assigned to the specified
        turnouts, and that the two turnouts are 'linked' to
        simulate a 3-way turnout. If create logic is requested and
        the tool does not have enough information available to set
        up the logic, you may have to return later after more
        signals have been assigned. The first time it is used for
        each 3-way turnout, this tool must be invoked from the
        Tools menu. After Layout Editor has recorded that the two
        turnouts are linked to simulate a 3-way turnout, selecting
        <b>Set Signals...</b> in the popup menu of either turnout
        will bring up this tool with both turnouts identified. (For
        more information, see the help page for the Set Signals at
        3-Way Turnouts window.)</li>

      <a name="zoommenu" id="zoommenu"></a>
      <h2>Using Layout Editor's Zoom Menu</h2>

      <p>The Zoom menu allows you to temporarily magnify a panel.
      The menu provides a choice of several magnification factors,
      and a <b>No Zoom</b> item to return to normal size. When a
      magnification factor is selected the panel is magnified by
      that factor. Scroll bars are automatically set to reasonable
      positions. Move scroll bars to focus on various parts of the
      panel.</p>

      <p>When a panel is magnified, all standard functions work,
      except for tooltips of icons. Items may be added, moved, or
      removed. Popup menus are available. Turnouts and
      Multi-sensors behave as they do at normal scale. If the grid
      is shown in edit mode, it is also magnified. All displayed
      coordinates are those of the unmagnified panel. A panel may
      be saved while magnified.</p>

      <p>When a panel is loaded, it always come up with <b>No
      Zoom</b> selected. Since zooming is temporary, the zoom
      factor is not preserved when a panel is saved.</p>

      <p><span class="since">Since 4.7.3</span>The Layout Editor Zoom
      is saved and restored per-system. Also the mouse wheel (with
      alt-(option-)key) may be used to zoom in and out.</p>

      <a name="markermenu" id="markermenu"></a>
      <h2>Using Layout Editor's Marker Menu</h2>

      <p>The Marker menu provides <b>Markers</b> that may be used
      to keep track of the location of trains on Layout Editor
      panels. Markers are small colored icons that display a train
      ID, usually the locomotive number. When running trains, a
      marker is created for each train, and that marker is moved
      around the panel as the train traverses the layout. This
      feature is especially useful to those who do not have block
      detection hardware, and therefore cannot use the <b>Train
      Tracking</b> feature of Layout Editor (<a href=
      "#tracking">see below</a>).</p>

      <p>Markers are different from other items on Layout Editor
      panels. in that all functions are active when the panel is
      not in edit mode. Markers may be created, repositioned, and
      removed at any time. The Marker menu and popup menus of
      individual Markers are always active. Markers that are
      present on a panel are saved to disk when the panel is saved
      to disk.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Add loco...</b> - Selecting this item brings up a
        small window that allows a Marker to be created from an
        entered Loco ID. The Marker icon is not very large, so no
        more than 6 characters should be entered. Usually the
        locomotive number is entered. After entering a Loco ID,
        click OK, and your a new white marker will appear at the
        center of the panel window. Use the marker's popup menu to
        change its color, etc. Dismiss this window by clicking the
        close icon in its title bar.</li>

        <li><b>Add loco from roster...</b> - Selecting this item
        brings up a small window that allows a Marker to be created
        for a locomotive in the JMRI roster. To use this item, the
        locomotive must be in the JMRI roster before the panel is
        opened. When a locomotive is selected in the roster menu, a
        marker for that locomotive immediately appears in the
        center of the panel. If it is present in the Roster Entry,
        the "Road number" is used as the Loco ID. Otherwise, the
        locomotive's dcc address is used. Use the marker's popup
        menu to change its color, etc. For markers created from a
        roster entry, the marker's popup menu has a <b>Throttle</b>
        item, that may be used to open a JMRI throttle for that
        locomotive. Dismiss this window by clicking the close icon
        in its title bar.</li>

        <li><b>Remove markers</b> - Selecting this item removes
        <b>all</b> markers from the Layout Editor panel. This item
        may not be undone. Note: A single marker may be removed by
        selecting <b>Remove</b> in its popup menu.</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="editing" id="editing"></a>
      <h2>Editing and Removing Items</h2>

      <p>Every item on a panel has a popup menu. <b>Except for
      Markers, popup menus are only active in edit mode.</b> To
      access the popup menu of an icon-based item (sensor icon,
      signal icon, text label, memory label, multi-sensor, fast
      clock, icon label, marker, recorder, or background): on
      Windows systems, right-click on the icon; on Macintosh
      systems, control-click on the icon (hold down the control key
      and click the mouse button on any point within the icon).
      Drawn items are similar, except for where you click. For
      turnouts, level crossings, or track segments, control-click
      or right-click inside the circle at the center of the item.
      For anchor points, end bumpers or edge connectors
      control-click or right-click inside the square showing the
      connection point.</p>

      <p>To delete an item from a panel, select <b>Remove</b> in
      that item's popup menu. Some items will show a verify dialog.
      Most verify dialogs have an option to shut off verify dialogs
      in case you're deleting many of the same items. When an icon
      object is "removed" from the panel, its icon is deleted, but
      the item itself (signal head, sensor, memory variable, etc.)
      is not deleted. If you need to delete the item itself, do so
      using the corresponding table (Signal Table, Sensor Table,
      etc.) <b>Important Note: Prior to deleting any item in a
      table, make sure that all references to that item are removed
      from other places. Also immediately after deleting an item,
      save your panel and restart before doing anything else!</b>
      If there is no good reason for deleting an item, or if there
      is uncertainty if all references to an item have been
      removed, don't delete the item from its table. Extra unused
      items in a table don't hurt anything, but deleting a
      referenced item can cause trouble. Removing an icon from a
      panel is safe, but deleting the item that the icon
      represented requires more caution.</p>

      <p>Some popup menus allow information relating to the item to
      be edited directly from the popup menu, for example, font
      size, style, and color options for text labels and text
      memory labels. The fast clock's popup menu allows stopping
      and starting the fast clock and changing its rate ratio.
      Icon-based popup menus show the <i>x</i> (horizontal) and
      <i>y</i> (vertical) location of the icon on the panel. These
      coordinates give the location of the upper left corner of the
      icon. A convenient way to change the location of an
      icon-based item is to select <b>Set x &amp; y</b> in its
      popup menu. Selecting <b>Set x &amp; y</b> brings up a small
      window that provides for precise adjustment of the icon's
      position.</p>

      <p>With turnouts, level crossings, and track segments,
      selecting <b>Edit...</b> in the popup menu brings up a small
      window for editing. If a turnout has no connections, a
      <b>Rotate</b> item appears in its popup menu, allowing the
      turnout to be rotated to any angle. More information on the
      edit dialogs of turnouts, level crossings, and track segments
      is contained below in the discussion of these items, and in
      the help page of each edit dialog.</p>

      <p>A signal head icon's popup menu allows editing of signal
      head information related to the panel, but also contains an
      <b>Edit Logic...</b> item that brings up a window for editing
      <a href="../blockboss/BlockBossFrame.shtml">Simple Signal Logic</a>
      (SSL) for the signal head. SSL supports ABS signaling, and will
      handle basic signal (head) logic.</p>
      <p><a href="../../../../html/tools/signaling/SignalMastLogic.shtml">Signal Mast Logic</a>
      - in short <b>SML</b> - was added to support Aspect based signaling.
      It is managed using the Signal Mast Logic table. In Layout Editor,
      Signal Masts can be placed at Turnouts, anchor points and level
      crossings, but only where there is a boundary between two different
      layout blocks. To add a Signal Mast using a Layout Editor Panel,
      right click on the Turnout, level crossing or anchor point and
      - if a block boundary exists - you will be given the option to
       "Set Signal Masts..."</p>
      <p>Refer to Logix for even more complicated
      logic needs not handled by SSL and SML.</p>

      <p>With turnouts, level crossings, and anchor points, most of
      Layout Editor's tools for assigning signal heads to these
      items, for automated placement of signal head icons on the
      panel, and for automated creation of signal logic for the
      assigned signal heads may be reached by selecting <b>Set
      Signals...</b> in the popup menu. <b>Set Signals...</b> is
      not shown in the popup menu until a minimum amount of
      information is available to the tools. The remaining <b>Set
      Signals...</b> tools may be accessed via the Tools menu.
      These tools are briefly described above under <a href=
      "#toolsmenu">Using Layout Editor's Tools Menu</a>, and are
      discussed in detail on the help page of the tool's dialog
      pane.</p>

      <a name="turnouts" id="turnouts"></a>
      <h2>Turnouts</h2>

      <p>Layout Editor supports six different types of turnouts
        (track switches):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>right- handed (<b>RH</b>)</li>
        <li>left-handed (<b>LH</b>)</li>
        <li>wye (<b>WYE</b>)</li>
        <li>double crossover (<b>Double Xover</b>)</li>
        <li>right-handed single crossover (<b>RH Xover</b>)</li>
        <li>left-handed single crossover (<b>LH Xover</b>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Two other types of turnouts sometimes used on model railroad
      layouts, double slip and three-way, can be drawn using two LH
      or RH turnouts. Double slip turnouts, for example, are easily
      represented by two LH and/or RH turnouts drawn with their
      throats connected by a short track segment. Once a turnout
      has been created, its type cannot be changed. Changing the
      type of a turnout requires removing and recreating the
      turnout. Drawn turnout parts may be lengthened, shortened, or
      repositioned by dragging connection points with the meta key
      pressed, and the entire turnout may be repositioned by
      dragging the center circle with the meta key pressed.</p>

      <p>When new turnouts (and crossovers) are created, Layout
      Editor uses default displacements from the center of the new
      turnout to "size" the new turnout drawing. Layout Editor
      maintains two sets of default displacements, one for for
      regular turnouts (<b>RH</b>, <b>LH</b>, <b>WYE</b>) and one
      for crossovers ( <b>Double Xover</b>, <b>RH Xover</b>, <b>LH
      Xover</b>). These default size parameters may be changed if a
      different default size is needed. First create a new turnout
      (or select an existing turnout) and resize it by dragging its
      connection points. Then select <b>Use Size As Default</b> in
      that turnout's popup menu. This will change default size
      parameters so that the next and subsequent turnouts to be
      added will be the same size as the resized turnout. Each
      <b>Use Size As Default</b> changes one of the two sets of
      default size parameters. Both sets of default size parameters
      are saved when the panel is saved. To return to Layout
      Editor's default turnout sizes select <b>Use Program Default
      Turnout Size</b> in the Tools menu.</p>

      <p>Turnout drawings in a track diagram are drawn using solid
      lines for both continuing and diverging legs until the
      turnout drawings are linked to turnouts in the Turnout Table.
      Once linked to actual turnouts, turnout drawings show the
      "known states" of the turnouts they represent. After linking,
      you can toggle each turnout on your layout by clicking on the
      center point of its drawing (provided <b>Allow Layout
      Control</b> is checked in the Options menu, and your DCC
      system supports computer control of turnouts). The ability to
      toggle by clicking can be turned off by checking
      <b>Disabled</b> in the turnout's popup menu.</p>

      <p>You can link each turnout drawing with an actual turnout
      (internal or hardware) in the Turnout Table as turnout
      drawings are created, by entering its Turnout Table name
      (either system name or user name) in the <b>Turnout: Name</b>
      field (top row of the tool bar) before clicking to create
      that turnout. Alternatively, you can create your turnout
      drawings first, then select <b>Edit...</b> in each turnout's
      popup menu to open an <b>Edit Turnout</b> dialog that allows
      entry of the turnout name. Once the name of an actual turnout
      is entered, the actual turnout can be toggled by clicking the
      mouse at the center of the turnout. Turnout toggling can be
      disabled by checking <b>Disabled</b> in the turnout's popup
      menu.</p>

      <p>Optionally, you can designate which <b>Block</b> a turnout
      is in either by entering a block name in the <b>Block:
      Name</b> field of the tool bar prior to creating each turnout
      drawing, or by entering a block name in the Edit Turnout
      dialog at a later time. The Edit Turnout dialog also allows
      an Edit Block dialog to be requested, where information for
      the turnout's block may be entered or changed. (Blocks are
      discussed more fully below.)</p>

      <p>When a side track branches from a mainline track at an RH
      or LH turnout, the mainline normally continues through the
      turnout by following the straight-through track leg (the
      closed path). Sometimes, however, the mainline follows the
      diverging leg (the thrown path). To allow entry of this
      information, the Edit Turnout dialog contains an entry called
      <b>Continuing Route Turnout State</b>. Continuing Route
      Turnout State defaults to Closed when a turnout drawing is
      created. You should change it to Thrown if the mainline track
      follows the Thrown path through the turnout. For a WYE
      turnout, you should always check to see if its Continuing
      Route Turnout State is set correctly to reflect the path of
      the mainline. To test if Continuing Route Turnout State is
      correctly set, check the state of the turnout in the Turnout
      Table when the turnout is set to clear the mainline. The
      Turnout Table state should match the Continuing Route Turnout
      State chosen in the Edit Turnout dialog. Defining mainline
      track is optional; if you are not defining mainline track
      this item can be ignored.</p>

      <p>Crossover turnouts differ from other turnouts in several
      important ways. Like other turnouts, crossovers have two
      states--crossed and straight. To change a crossover's state,
      however, requires two or four track switches to change in
      unison. This may be accomplished using one to four switch
      machines. Normally a crossover is assigned a single turnout
      entry in the turnout table, but it may have several if its
      switch machines are controlled by different stationary
      decoders. (You can use two JMRI Routes controlled by the same
      internal turnout to make multiple switch machines work
      together. In this case, enter the internal turnout as the
      turnout linked to the crossover turnout drawing.) With
      crossovers, the crossover tracks are always considered side
      track, and any mainline track entering the turnout, leaves on
      the same straight as it entered. So there is no Continuing
      Route Turnout State entry in a crossover's Edit dialog.</p>

      <p>If you are defining blocks through crossovers, note that
      crossovers have four connecting points, each of which may be
      connected to a different track block. So parts of a crossover
      may be in one, two, three, or four separate blocks. The Edit
      Turnout dialog for a crossover allows the entry of up to four
      blocks, each linked to one of the four connection points. The
      first block entered must be the <b>Block: Name</b> field;
      this block is linked to upper left connection point (if the
      turnout has not been rotated), and serves as the default
      block for the crossover. If any of <b>Block 2</b>, <b>Block
      3</b>, or <b>Block 4</b> entries are blank, the default block
      is used. Block connection points are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4,
      proceeding from the upper left connection point in a
      clockwise direction.</p>

      <a name="track" id="track"></a>
      <h2>Track Segments and Connection Points</h2>

      <p>A <b>Track Segment</b> is a two ended piece of track between
      two connection points. Connection points are found on anchor
      points, end bumpers, edge connectors, turnouts, slips, cross
      overs, level crossings and turn tables.
      </p>
      <p>Anchor points have one connection point that accept two
      connections. All other connection points only accept one.
      End bumpers have one connection point. An Edge Connector
      only accepts one connection and is used to mark the "Edge"
      of the current layout. Each turnout has three connection
      points and each slip, cross over and level crossing has four.
      </p>
      <p>
      A connection point that can accept a connecting track segment
      is drawn <strong><span style="color:red">red</span></strong>.
      When a connection point has its capacity of connections, its
      color is changed to
      <strong><span style="color:green">green</span></strong>.
      When all  connection points are
      <strong><span style="color:green">green</span></strong>
      , the layout diagram is complete with all connections defined.
      </p>
      <p>Track segments are normally drawn as solid lines. but you
      can designate that a track segment be drawn <i>dashed</i> to
      show tunnels or tracks crossing at different grades. You can
      request a dashed line for a track segment by checking
      <b>Dashed</b> in the tool bar before the track segment is
      created, or you can change a track segment to <b>Dashed</b>
      in the Edit Track Segment dialog. (More anchor points can be
      added to get the dashed part of your track to cover the exact
      area desired.) You can also designate a track segment as
      <i>hidden</i> so it's displayed only when edit mode is
      active. <i>Hidden</i> track segments are useful for track
      diagrams drawn as multiple rows where the end of one row
      connects to the beginning of the same or another row. To make
      a track segment hidden, check <b>Hide Track</b> in the Edit
      Track Segment dialog.
      </p>

      <p>The default appearance of a track segment is a straight
      line however you may change its appearance to <b>Circle</b>,
      <b>Ellipse</b> or <b>Bezier</b> via its popup menu (when in edit
      mode). Circled track segments are drawn as fixed radius arc's
      connecting the two end points. When in edit mode the radius may
      be adjusted by dragging the center point of the circle. An
      ellipsed track segments end points are connected with an arc
      and a Bezier track segments end points are connected with a
      Bezier curve. Control points are used to effect the curve of
      Bezier track segments and may be added or deleted via the
      track segment's popup menu (when in edit mode).
      </p>

      <p>Optionally, track segments are used to designate
      <i>mainline track</i> or <i>side track</i>. The legs of
      turnouts and level crossings are set to <i>mainline track</i>
      or <i>side track</i> according to the designations of track
      segments that are connected to them. See the discussion of
      continuing routes in the above section on turnouts for
      information on how a mainline is tracked through a
      turnout.</p>

      <p>If <b>Mainline</b> is checked in the tool bar when a track
      segment is created, that track segment is designated as
      <i>mainline track</i>, otherwise it is considered <i>side
      track</i>. You can change from mainline track to side track,
      or vice versa, in the Edit Track dialog. Mainline track and
      side track may be drawn with different width lines. Track
      widths for each are set using the <b>Set Track Width...</b>
      item in the Options menu.</p>

      <p>Optionally, you can designate which <b>Block</b> a track
      segment is in--either by entering a block name in the
      <b>Block: Name</b> field of the tool bar prior to creating
      each track segment, or by entering a block name in the Edit
      Track Segment dialog at a later time. The Edit Track Segment
      dialog also allows a Create/Edit Block dialog to be
      requested, so information for the track segment's block may
      be entered or changed. (Blocks are discussed more fully
      below.)</p>

      <p>An <b>Edge Connector</b> is used to denote that the current
      track finished on this panel and can continue on another one. The
      connector uses the same <strong><span
      style="color:red">red</span></strong> / <strong><span
      style="color:green">green</span></strong> states of an Anchor
      point, along with a third <strong><span
      style="color:blue">blue</span></strong> state which means that the
      connector has not been linked with a track segment on a different
      panel. To do the linking, right click on the edge connector and
      select "edit link", the dialogue box which appears will be
      populated with a list of available layout panels, and any valid
      edge connectors. A valid edge connector is defined as one that is
      not already linked, is connected to a track segment that is
      configured with a block, which is not the same as the block our
      connected track segment is configured as (ie the edge connector
      becomes a block boundary). And that the two track segments are
      going in the same direction.</p>

      <p><a name="xing" id="xing"></a></p>

      <h2>Level Crossings</h2>

      <p>A level crossing is a special piece of track that
      represents two tracks crossing at grade. A level crossing is
      commonly referred to as a diamond. A level crossing has four
      connection points, and two tracks, designated 1 and 2. When a
      level crossing is created, track 1 is the horizontal track,
      and track 2 is the inclined track. The angle between the two
      tracks, the incline of each track, and the length of each
      track may be varied by dragging connection points with the
      meta key pressed. The center of the level crossing may be
      positioned by dragging the center circle with the meta key
      pressed (see the help bar for which key is the meta key for
      your operating system).</p>

      <p>Optionally each track will be either <i>mainline track</i>
      or <i>side track</i> depending on the mainline track or side
      track designation of the track segments connected to each
      track. Also optionally you may independently assign each
      track to a different block. If a block name is entered in the
      <b>Block: Name</b> field of the tool bar prior to creating a
      level crossing, that block is assigned to both tracks. Each
      track may be assigned to a different block in the Edit Level
      Crossing dialog. The Edit Level Crossing dialog also allows a
      Create/Edit Block dialog to be requested for each of the two
      blocks, so information for these blocks may be entered or
      changed. The block(s) assigned to a level crossing may be
      different from the block(s) of connected track segments; in
      this case, each level crossing connecting point where the
      block changes serves as a block boundary. (Blocks are
      discussed more fully below.)</p><a name="turn" id="turn"></a>

      <h2>Turntables</h2>

      <p>A Layout Editor turntable is a schematic representation of
      a turntable on the layout. A turntable is drawn as a circle
      with a variable number of track connections, called <i>ray
      tracks</i>. Each <i>ray track</i> is drawn as a short stub
      track radiating from the turntable circle. A track segment
      should connect to each ray track. Most of these track
      segments will connect a ray track to an end bumper. The
      distance of each ray track connection point from the
      turntable circle is fixed, but the direction of each ray
      track may be varied by dragging its connection point around
      the turntable circle. Any number of turntables may be added
      to a panel, and each turntable may have any number of ray
      tracks.</p>

      <p>A turntable is added to a panel by selecting <b>Add
      Turntable</b> in the panel's Option menu. New turntables are
      placed at the center of the panel, and should be moved to
      desired locations by dragging its center point with the meta
      key pressed (right button drag on Windows). When a turntable
      is added, it has four ray tracks located in up, down, left,
      and right directions. The turntable's popup menu has two
      items. Selecting <b>Edit...</b> brings up an Edit Turntable
      dialog, and selecting <b>Remove</b> deletes the turntable and
      any track segments connected to it. Before a turntable is
      actually deleted, the program asks for verification of that
      action.</p>

      <p>The Edit Turntable dialog allows the radius of the
      turntable circle to be changed, and provides for the addition
      and deletion of ray tracks. For more information on how to
      add and delete ray tracks, see the help page of the Edit
      Turntable dialog.</p>

      <a name="background" id="background"></a>
      <h2>Backgrounds</h2>

      <p>Background images are not required for Layout Editor
      panels. Support for adding a background is provided for
      panels that require other than the default Layout Editor
      background. Background images may be used simply to change
      the color of the Layout Editor background, or for more
      sophisticated applications, such as setting up a CTC
      panel.</p>

      <p>A background image may be created using any pixel-based
      image editor to create the image, and to save it as a .gif
      format image file. You may create a single background image
      for the whole panel, or create vertical slices to be used in
      a multi-slice background (see below). For a multi-slice
      background, create your slice image(s), then add copies, one
      to the right of the other, until the desired panel area is
      covered.</p>

      <p><b>Important Note: if you create your own background
      images (or icons), don't store them with the JMRI distribution
      images or they will be deleted when you upgrade JMRI.
      Instead, create a new folder called "resources" in your JMRI
      Preferences directory (where your panel file is stored), and
      add your images and icons to that folder.</b></p>

      <p>A background image is added to a panel by selecting <b>Add
      Background Image...</b> in the panel's Option menu. Selecting
      <b>Add Background Image...</b> brings up a file selection
      dialog for selecting the file containing the background
      image. Layout Editor provides for multiple background images.
      The first background image is placed with its upper left
      corner at x = 0, and y = 0. The next background image is
      placed at the top of the panel and to the right of right-most
      existing background image. This allows easy implementation of
      multi-slice background images (see below). The <i>x, y</i>
      location of the upper left corner of each background image is
      shown in it's popup menu. This location may be changed by
      selecting <b>Set x &amp; y</b> in the popup menu.</p>

      <p>For users building a classic US&amp;S panel, there are two
      sets of predefined image 'slices' currently available. One
      set is 718 pixels high, and the second set is 900 pixels
      high. Choose the set that best fits your display. These
      'slices' are located at icons/USS/background/. The 900 pixel
      high images include a "-9" in their names. The left and right
      edge images are each 12 pixels wide. The main panel 'slices'
      are 65 pixels wide. First add the left edge image, then add a
      blank slice or one including switch plate(s) for each turnout
      on your CTC panel, then finish by adding the right edge
      image. The advantages of building CTC backgrounds with slices
      are that 1) you can make virtually any length CTC panel, and
      2) the plates will be precisely located
      automatically.</p>

      <a name="block" id="block"></a>
      <h2>Blocks</h2>

      <p>Blocks are sections of track whose occupancy may be
      individually monitored. Dividing track into blocks is
      optional. Blocks set up in a track diagram normally
      correspond to physical blocks on a layout. Block occupancy is
      indicated by the state of an <i>occupancy sensor</i>. When a
      layout's track is divided into blocks, all of the track need
      not belong to a block. For example, yard track is normally
      not in a block, whereas mainline track almost always would be
      divided into blocks. The main use of blocks is to facilitate
      signaling, but blocks may be used for other layout control
      and animation functions.</p>

      <p>If a block name is entered in the <b>Block: Name</b> field
      of the tool bar prior to adding a turnout, level crossing, or
      track segment, the added item is assigned to that block; if a
      sensor name (system name or user name) was entered into the
      <b>Occupancy Sensor</b> field, that sensor will be assigned
      to the entered block. A turnout, level crossing, or track
      segment may also be assigned to a block by entering that
      block's name in the edit dialog accessed by selecting
      <b>Edit...</b> in that items popup menu. In either case, if a
      block with the entered name doesn't exist, one is
      created.</p>

      <p>A block name may be any series of alphabetic or numeric
      characters that describe the block, for example, "Red Main
      2", "Lake Siding", or "Moose Block". Once a block is created,
      its name may not be changed; attempting to change a block's
      name will create a new block having the new name. After all
      items assigned to the old block are changed to the new block,
      the block with the old name will be automatically deleted
      (see below).</p>

      <p>Turnout, level crossing, and track segment edit dialogs
      provide access to the Create/Edit Block dialog where
      information specific to a block may be entered or edited. The
      <b>Occupancy Sensor:</b> field in the Create/Edit Block
      dialog shows the name of the occupancy sensor currently
      assigned to the block, if there is one. To enter or change
      the occupancy sensor, enter the name (system name or user
      name) of a sensor in the Sensor Table in the <b>Occupancy
      Sensor:</b> field. A sensor may be assigned as the occupancy
      sensor of only one block; attempting to do otherwise will
      result in an error message. Normally, the state of an
      occupancy sensor is "Active" when a block is occupied, so
      "Active" for occupied sense is the automatic default. This
      can be changed by selecting "Inactive" in the <b>Occupied
      Sense:</b> selection box.</p>

      <p>Block track colors are used instead of the default track
      color if a section of track is in a block. The track items in
      a block are drawn with different track colors for occupied
      and unoccupied states, allowing the track in a block to
      change color as a train enters and leaves that block. To set
      track colors, select the unoccupied track color in the
      <b>Track Color:</b> selection box, and select the occupied
      track color in the <b>Occupied Track Color:</b> selection
      box. An alternate unoccupied track color is provided for
      special uses. For example, <a href=
      "../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a> has an option
      to use the alternate unoccupied track color for blocks that are
      allocated but unoccupied. Set the alternate unoccupied track
      color using the <b>Alternate Track Color:</b> selection box.
      When track color is set, Layout Editor will use the occupied
      track color if a block is occupied, then if not occupied,
      will use the alternate unoccupied track color if it has been
      requested, otherwise it uses the unoccupied track color.</p>

      <p>Since blocks are items on the physical layout, the same
      block may be used in more than one panel. Consequently, block
      information is saved in the non-panel specific portion of the
      layout information, when panels are saved to a file on
      disk.</p>

      <p>Blocks are deleted automatically when they are no longer
      used. Layout Editor keeps track of the number of track items
      (turnouts, track segments, and level crossings) that are
      assigned to a block. This count is displayed in the
      Create/Edit Block dialog as <b>Current Use Count:</b>. When
      panels are saved to disk, only those blocks with a use count
      greater than zero are saved.</p>

      <a name="tracking" id="tracking"></a>
      <h2>Train Tracking</h2>

      <p><b>Train Tracking</b> is an animation technique that
      allows us to display dynamically which train is in an
      occupied Block. So, for one train, or for several trains
      transiting a layout at the same time, we can show where each
      train is at any given time. <b>Train Tracking</b> uses the
      JMRI Block software. Each occupied block has a <i>value</i>,
      which is automatically passed from block to block as a train
      moves from block to block. A block's <i>value</i> is cleared
      when the block is no longer occupied. So the <i>value</i>
      follows the train around the layout. Setting <i>value</i> to
      a train name, passes the train name around from block to
      block.</p>

      <p>Layout Editor has a built-in tool that automatically
      initializes each Block, creating needed Paths and
      BeanSettings. This initialization (previously done in scripts
      only) is needed to allow block software to track trains.
      Since Layout Editor captures the full connectivity of its
      panel, it has the information needed to perform this
      initialization. Block initialization is automatically
      performed when blocks are changed and when a Layout Editor
      panel is loaded. Since the initialization is automatic,
      Layout Editor users don't need to be concerned about Paths
      and Bean Settings.</p>

      <p>Layout Editor allows the display of the block contents on
      the panel.</p>

      <p>This might sound complicated, but it's very easy to set up
      because JMRI's Block and Layout Editor software does almost
      everything automatically. There is even software to
      automatically save and restore Block contents <i>values</i>
      between sessions.</p>

      <p>If your panel has blocks assigned to the track and each
      block has a hardware occupancy sensor, you're ready to set
      up Train Tracking:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>1. Place a Block Contents Label near each block in the
        panel.</li>

        <li>2. Open the Block Table, and enter the name of each
        train in the "Value" column of the block it is occupying.
        <b>Remember to click somewhere outside the value entry box
        after entering a train name to make Java read what was
        entered.</b></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note: If the program detects a block is unoccupied
      <i>before</i> the block's <i>value</i> is passed on to the
      next block, the train name will be lost. So it's important to
      have wheels and track clean, and to have enough cars in each
      train with current drawing wheels to ensure a block doesn't
      loose detection before the train enters the next
      block.</p>

      <a name="tips" id="tips"></a>
      <h2>Tips</h2>

      <p>Because of the way a Layout Editor panel is refreshed, the
      drawn track schematic will be on top of all icons and labels.
      It is possible to have a label or icon appear to be "on top
      of" a section of track, as is commonly done in Panel Editor.
      To create a break in visible track, without breaking
      connectivity, place an Anchor Point at each end of the break.
      Connect these anchor points with a track segment. Make the
      connecting track segment invisible by editing it and checking
      <b>Hide Track</b>. The track segment will show as a narrow
      line when in edit mode, but will be invisible when edit mode
      is turned off.</p>

      <p>Remember that "system names" of items (turnouts, sensors,
      signal heads, etc.) may not be changed, but "user names" may
      be changed. If there is any chance that you might want to
      change an item's user name, use its system name when selecting
      an item. If you use the user name, and then
      change the user name, all assignments using the old user name
      will break, until you edit all occurrences of the old user
      name to the new user name.</p>

      <p>Since Panel Editor panels are fully icon based, their
      track schematic has the possibility of looking more
      prototypical. Layout Editor panels have more animation
      possibilities and automated tools for setting up signals,
      train tracking, etc. If you would like both worlds, consider
      building both Panel Editor and Layout Editor panels for your
      layout. You can switch between them easily using the
      <b>Panels</b> menu. Since both type of panels share the same
      configuration items (turnouts, sensors, memory variables,
      block contents, signal heads, etc.), whatever is set in one
      panel is reflected in the other if the same items are
      displayed. After they are loaded, panels continue to
      function, whether they are displayed or not-- they just need
      to show up in the <b>Show Panel</b> submenu. So, for example,
      if you set up a Layout Editor panel for train tracking as
      described above, you can track trains in a companion Panel
      Editor panel just by adding Block Contents Labels or follow a
      bunch of sensors using a dedicated Switchboard.</p>

      <a name="finish" id="finish"></a>
      <h2>Putting Finishing Touches on your Panel</h2>

      <p>Below is an enhanced version of the simple oval panel
      constructed in <b>Getting Started with Layout Editor</b>. The
      general steps needed to get from that starting panel to this
      panel are sketched below. The steps need not be done in the
      exact same order presented. The presented order works, but
      variations are possible to get to the same end point. This
      example is presented to illustrate some of the things that
      can be done easily using Layout Editor. You may elect to do
      more or less on your Layout Editor panels.</p><a href=
      "./images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif"><img src=
      "./images/EnhancedPanel.gif" align="middle" width="592"
      height="171" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt=
      "Enhanced Panel Image"></a>

      <ul>
        <li>Turnouts from the Turnout Table were assigned to each
        turnout graphic using the <b>Edit...</b> item in each
        turnout's popup menu.</li>

        <li>Three new anchor points were added-one on each side
        vertical track, and one on the bottom track to serve as
        <i>block boundaries</i>. Block boundaries are places on the
        track where two blocks join; track at a block boundary is
        normally gapped on the physical layout. Adding anchor
        points was made easier by using the <b>Translate
        Selection</b>... tool in the Tools menu, to spread out the
        original panel in the vertical and horizontal
        directions.</li>

        <li>Layout track was divided into blocks by assigning block
        names to all track segments and turnouts. When a block name
        is entered, if a block by that name doesn't exist, a new
        block is automatically created. Turnouts were placed in the
        same block as the track segment connected to their throats
        (facing points), and track segments connecting to turnout
        continuing and diverging points were placed in different
        blocks.</li>

        <li>Block names were placed on the panel using <b>Text
        Label</b> on the toolbar. This was done for this
        illustrated example, but you may or may not want to display
        block names on your final panel.</li>

        <li>Each block was assigned an occupancy sensor from the
        Sensor Table. Sensors were added to the Sensor Table prior
        to assigning occupancy sensors. An occupancy sensor was
        assigned to each block using the <b>Create/Edit Block</b>
        button in the <b>Edit Track Segment</b> dialog of one of
        the track segments in the block.</li>

        <li>Track on the main oval were designated <i>mainline
        track</i> using the <b>Edit Track Segment</b> dialog for
        each track segment. This gave different track widths for
        mainline and side track.</li>

        <li>Signal Heads were defined in the Signal Head Table for
        each of the signals to be placed on the panel. Triple Output
        signal head types were used for all.</li>

        <li>Signals Heads were placed at turnouts using the <b>Set
        Signals at Turnout</b> tool in the Tools menu. For each
        signal head <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> was checked,
        but <b>Set up Logic</b> was not.</li>

        <li>Signal Heads were placed at block boundaries at the three
        anchor points using <b>Set Signals at Block Boundary</b> in
        the Tools menu. <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> was
        checked, but <b>Set up Logic</b> was not.</li>

        <li>Logic for the signal heads at turnouts was set up using
        <b>Set Signals at Turnout</b>. The name of the turnout was
        entered, then <b>Get Saved</b> was clicked to retrieve the
        turnout names. Next <b>Set up Logic</b> was checked for
        each signal head, and <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> was
        not.</li>

        <li>Logic for signals at anchor point block boundaries was
        set up using <b>Set Signals at Block Boundary</b> by
        following a similar procedure.</li>

        <li>Since all signal heads will show <strong><span
        style="color:red">red</span></strong> if occupancy sensors are
        in an "Unknown" state, the Sensor Table was opened and all
        occupancy sensors were set to "Inactive" (unoccupied) by
        clicking "Unknown" once. Then the industry turnout was clicked
        to set it to thrown, producing the panel shown above (with Edit
        Mode switched off in the Options menu).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You should be able to toggle your turnouts by clicking at
      their centers and watch your signal heads change color. If you
      don't have hardware yet for your occupancy sensors, you can
      change their state in the Sensor Table to simulate a train
      moving on the layout. (Or you could set up Sensor Icons and
      click on them to change their state.) If any of the above
      steps are not clear, consult the description of that item in
      the documentation above. The help page for each referenced
      tool also contains explanatory information about that
      tool.</p>

      <p>This is an example of what can easily be done using Layout
      Editor. For those planning to install signal heads, setting up a
      panel with blocks defined and signal heads placed can help in
      deciding where blocks and signal heads/masts should be placed before
      actually installing them on your layout.</p>
