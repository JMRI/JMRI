      <h1>Edit Turnout</h1>

      <h2>Turnouts</h2>
      Layout Editor supports six different types of turnouts (track switches): right- handed
      (<strong>RH</strong>), left-handed (<strong>LH</strong>), wye (<strong>WYE</strong>), double
      crossover (<strong>Double Xover</strong>), right-handed single crossover (<strong>RH
      Xover</strong>), and left-handed single crossover (<strong>LH Xover</strong>). The other two
      types of turnouts sometimes used on model railroad layouts, double slip and three-way, can be
      drawn using two LH or RH turnouts. Double slip turnouts, for example, are easily represented
      by two LH and/or RH turnouts drawn with their throats connected by a short track segment.
      Once a turnout has been created, its type cannot be changed. Changing the type of a turnout
      requires removing and recreating the turnout.
      <h2>Linking Turnout Drawings to Actual Turnouts</h2>
      Turnout drawings in a track diagram are drawn using solid lines for both continuing and
      diverging legs until the turnout drawings are linked to turnouts in the Turnout Table. Once
      linked to actual turnouts, turnout drawings show the "known states" of the turnouts they
      represent. This feature can be turned off by unchecking <strong>Allow Turnout
      Animation</strong> in the Options menu. After linking, you can toggle each turnout on your
      layout by clicking on the center point of its drawing (provided <strong>Allow Layout
      Control</strong> is checked in the Options menu, and your DCC system supports computer
      control of turnouts). The ability to toggle by clicking can be turned off by checking
      <strong>Disabled</strong> in the turnout's popup menu.
      <p>You can link each turnout drawing with an actual turnout (internal or hardware) in the
      Turnout Table as turnout drawings are created, by entering its Turnout Table name (either
      system name or user name) in the <strong>Turnout: Name</strong> field (top row of the tool
      bar) before clicking to create that turnout. Alternatively, you can create your turnout
      drawings first, then select <strong>Edit...</strong> in each turnout's popup menu to open an
      <strong>Edit Turnout</strong> dialog that allows entry of the turnout name.</p>

      <p>It is also possible to link in a second turnout to operate at the same time as the one
      specified for this turnout. Where the turnout is a Xover, a second turnout address can be
      specified, so that if the Xover is controlled by two different DCC turnout addresses both
      turnouts will be throw.<br>
      Where the turnout is either a LH, RH or WYE, and two physical turnouts are controlled by the
      same DCC address you can add one turnout to the panel using the real address and the second
      turnout using an "Internal" turnout, you can then link the two together so that if one
      turnout is thrown the other will follow.</p>

      <h2>Setting a Turnout's Block</h2>
      Optionally, you can designate which <strong>Block</strong> a turnout is in either by entering
      a block name in the <strong>Block: Name</strong> field of the tool bar prior to creating each
      turnout drawing, or by entering a block name in the Edit Turnout dialog at a later time. The
      Edit Turnout dialog also allows a Create/Edit Block dialog to be requested, where information
      for the turnout's block may be entered or changed. Blocks are discussed more fully on the
      help page of the Create/Edit Block dialog.
      <h2>Continuing Route Turnout State</h2>
      When a side track branches from a mainline track at an RH or LH turnout, the mainline
      normally continues through the turnout by following the straight-through track leg (the
      closed path). Sometimes, however, the mainline follows the diverging leg (the thrown path).
      To allow entry of this information, the Edit Turnout dialog contains an entry called
      <strong>Continuing Route Turnout State</strong>. Continuing Route Turnout State defaults to
      Closed when a turnout drawing is created. You should change it to Thrown if the mainline
      track follows the Thrown path through the turnout. For a WYE turnout, you should always check
      to see if its Continuing Route Turnout State is set correctly to reflect the path of the
      mainline. To test if Continuing Route Turnout State is correctly set, check the state of the
      turnout in the Turnout Table when the turnout is set to clear the mainline. The Turnout Table
      state should match the Continuing Route Turnout State chosen in the Edit Turnout dialog.
      Defining mainline track is optional; if you are not defining mainline track this item can be
      ignored.
      <h2>Crossover Turnouts</h2>
      Crossover turnouts differ from other turnouts in several important ways. Like other turnouts,
      crossovers have two states--crossed and straight. To change a crossover's state, however,
      requires two or four track switches to change in unison. This may be accomplished using one
      to four switch machines. Normally a crossover is assigned a single turnout entry in the
      turnout table, but it may have several if its switch machines are controlled by different
      stationary decoders. (You can use two JMRI Routes controlled by the same internal turnout to
      make multiple switch machines work together. In this case, enter the internal turnout as the
      turnout linked to the crossover turnout drawing.) With crossovers, the crossover tracks are
      always considered side track, and any mainline track entering the turnout, leaves on the same
      straight as it entered. So there is no Continuing Route Turnout State entry in a crossover's
      Edit dialog.
      <p>If you are defining blocks through crossovers, note that crossovers have four connecting
      points, each of which may be connected to a different track block. So parts of a crossover
      may be in one, two, three, or four separate blocks. The Edit Turnout dialog for a crossover
      allows the entry of up to four blocks, each linked to one of the four connection points. The
      first block entered must be the <strong>Block</strong> field and serves as the default block
      for the crossover. Block 1's connection point is highlighted in blue when a track segment is
      connected, otherwise if the turnout has not been rotated it is the top left hand point. If
      any of <strong>Block 2</strong>, <strong>Block 3</strong>, or <strong>Block 4</strong>
      entries are blank, the default block is used. Block connection points are numbered 1, 2, 3
      and 4, proceeding from the upper left connection point in a clockwise direction.</p>
