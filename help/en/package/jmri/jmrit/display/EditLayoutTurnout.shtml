      <h1>Edit Turnout</h1>

      <h2>Turnouts</h2>Layout Editor supports six different types
      of turnouts (track switches): right- handed (<b>RH</b>),
      left-handed (<b>LH</b>), wye (<b>WYE</b>), double crossover
      (<b>Double Xover</b>), right-handed single crossover (<b>RH
      Xover</b>), and left-handed single crossover (<b>LH
      Xover</b>). The other two types of turnouts sometimes used on
      model railroad layouts, double slip and three-way, can be
      drawn using two LH or RH turnouts. Double slip turnouts, for
      example, are easily represented by two LH and/or RH turnouts
      drawn with their throats connected by a short track segment.
      Once a turnout has been created, its type cannot be changed.
      Changing the type of a turnout requires removing and
      recreating the turnout.

      <h2>Linking Turnout Drawings to Actual Turnouts</h2>Turnout
      drawings in a track diagram are drawn using solid lines for
      both continuing and diverging legs until the turnout drawings
      are linked to turnouts in the Turnout Table. Once linked to
      actual turnouts, turnout drawings show the "known states" of
      the turnouts they represent. This feature can be turned off
      by unchecking <b>Allow Turnout Animation</b> in the Options
      menu. After linking, you can toggle each turnout on your
      layout by clicking on the center point of its drawing
      (provided <b>Allow Layout Control</b> is checked in the
      Options menu, and your DCC system supports computer control
      of turnouts). The ability to toggle by clicking can be turned
      off by checking <b>Disabled</b> in the turnout's popup menu.

      <p>You can link each turnout drawing with an actual turnout
      (internal or hardware) in the Turnout Table as turnout
      drawings are created, by entering its Turnout Table name
      (either system name or user name) in the <b>Turnout: Name</b>
      field (top row of the tool bar) before clicking to create
      that turnout. Alternatively, you can create your turnout
      drawings first, then select <b>Edit...</b> in each turnout's
      popup menu to open an <b>Edit Turnout</b> dialog that allows
      entry of the turnout name.</p>

      <p>It is also possible to link in a second turnout to operate
      at the same time as the one specified for this turnout. Where
      the turnout is a Xover, a second turnout address can be
      specified, so that if the Xover is controlled by two
      different DCC turnout addresses both turnouts will be
      throw.<br>
      Where the turnout is either a LH, RH or WYE, and two physical
      turnouts are controlled by the same DCC address you can add
      one turnout to the panel using the real address and the
      second turnout using an "Internal" turnout, you can then link
      the two together so that if one turnout is thrown the other
      will follow.</p>

      <h2>Setting a Turnout's Block</h2>Optionally, you can
      designate which <b>Block</b> a turnout is in either by
      entering a block name in the <b>Block: Name</b> field of the
      tool bar prior to creating each turnout drawing, or by
      entering a block name in the Edit Turnout dialog at a later
      time. The Edit Turnout dialog also allows a Create/Edit Block
      dialog to be requested, where information for the turnout's
      block may be entered or changed. Blocks are discussed more
      fully on the help page of the Create/Edit Block dialog.

      <h2>Continuing Route Turnout State</h2>When a side track
      branches from a mainline track at an RH or LH turnout, the
      mainline normally continues through the turnout by following
      the straight-through track leg (the closed path). Sometimes,
      however, the mainline follows the diverging leg (the thrown
      path). To allow entry of this information, the Edit Turnout
      dialog contains an entry called <b>Continuing Route Turnout
      State</b>. Continuing Route Turnout State defaults to Closed
      when a turnout drawing is created. You should change it to
      Thrown if the mainline track follows the Thrown path through
      the turnout. For a WYE turnout, you should always check to
      see if its Continuing Route Turnout State is set correctly to
      reflect the path of the mainline. To test if Continuing Route
      Turnout State is correctly set, check the state of the
      turnout in the Turnout Table when the turnout is set to clear
      the mainline. The Turnout Table state should match the
      Continuing Route Turnout State chosen in the Edit Turnout
      dialog. Defining mainline track is optional; if you are not
      defining mainline track this item can be ignored.

      <h2>Crossover Turnouts</h2>Crossover turnouts differ from
      other turnouts in several important ways. Like other
      turnouts, crossovers have two states--crossed and straight.
      To change a crossover's state, however, requires two or four
      track switches to change in unison. This may be accomplished
      using one to four switch machines. Normally a crossover is
      assigned a single turnout entry in the turnout table, but it
      may have several if its switch machines are controlled by
      different stationary decoders. (You can use two JMRI Routes
      controlled by the same internal turnout to make multiple
      switch machines work together. In this case, enter the
      internal turnout as the turnout linked to the crossover
      turnout drawing.) With crossovers, the crossover tracks are
      always considered side track, and any mainline track entering
      the turnout, leaves on the same straight as it entered. So
      there is no Continuing Route Turnout State entry in a
      crossover's Edit dialog.

      <p>If you are defining blocks through crossovers, note that
      crossovers have four connecting points, each of which may be
      connected to a different track block. So parts of a crossover
      may be in one, two, three, or four separate blocks. The Edit
      Turnout dialog for a crossover allows the entry of up to four
      blocks, each linked to one of the four connection points. The
      first block entered must be the <b>Block</b> field and serves
      as the default block for the crossover. Block 1's connection
      point is highlighted in blue when a track segment is
      connected, otherwise if the turnout has not been rotated it
      is the top left hand point. If any of <b>Block 2</b>,
      <b>Block 3</b>, or <b>Block 4</b> entries are blank, the
      default block is used. Block connection points are numbered
      1, 2, 3 and 4, proceeding from the upper left connection
      point in a clockwise direction.</p>
