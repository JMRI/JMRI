      <h1>Translate Selection</h1>

      <p>The Translate Selection dialog provides for translating in 2D a user-selected part of a
      panel created using Layout Editor. Before selecting <strong>Translate Selection...</strong>
      in the Options menu, an area of the panel must be "selected". To select an area, press and
      hold down the mouse at the upper left of the area, and drag the mouse to the lower right of
      the area. The selected area is outlined by a rectangle. For icon items, the upper left corner
      of the icon must be within the selection rectangle if the icon is to be translated.</p>

      <p>To translate your selected area in the Panel window, enter the amount to translate in the
      <em>x</em> (horizontal) and <em>y</em> (vertical) directions. The units are pixels--the same
      units shown in the <em>x,y</em> position display in the Layout Editor tool bar. For no
      translation in either direction enter zero. For horizontal translation, enter a negative
      number to move the selected area left that number of pixels; enter a positive number to move
      right. For vertical translation, enter a negative number to move the selected area up by that
      number of pixels; enter a positive number to move the selected area down.</p>

      <p>After entering the amounts to translate, click <strong>Move Selection</strong> to move the
      selected area. <strong>Caution:</strong> translating too far can move the upper left corner
      of an icon over the edge of the panel, where it cannot be selected, and may disappear
      forever. Fortunately, if you make this mistake, you can undo a translation by immediately
      selecting <strong>Undo Translation</strong> in the Options menu. <strong>Undo
      Translation</strong> only works for the last <strong>Translate Selection...</strong>
      performed. Remember to check results immediately after translating a selection in case
      undoing the operation is needed.</p>

      <p><strong>To retain your changes, please remember to save your Panel!</strong>
