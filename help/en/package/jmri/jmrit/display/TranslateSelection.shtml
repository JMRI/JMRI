      <h1>Translate Selection</h1>

      <p>The Translate Selection dialog provides for translating in 2D
      a user-selected part of a panel created using Layout Editor.
      Before selecting <b>Translate Selection...</b> in the Options
      menu, an area of the panel must be "selected". To select an
      area, press and hold down the mouse at the upper left of the
      area, and drag the mouse to the lower right of the area. The
      selected area is outlined by a rectangle. For icon items, the
      upper left corner of the icon must be within the selection
      rectangle if the icon is to be translated.</p>

      <p>To translate your selected area in the Panel window, enter
      the amount to translate in the <i>x</i> (horizontal) and
      <i>y</i> (vertical) directions. The units are pixels--the
      same units shown in the <i>x,y</i> position display in the
      Layout Editor tool bar. For no translation in either
      direction enter zero. For horizontal translation, enter a
      negative number to move the selected area left that number of
      pixels; enter a positive number to move right. For vertical
      translation, enter a negative number to move the selected
      area up by that number of pixels; enter a positive number to
      move the selected area down.</p>

      <p>After entering the amounts to translate, click <b>Move
      Selection</b> to move the selected area. <b>Caution:</b>
      translating too far can move the upper left corner of an icon
      over the edge of the panel, where it cannot be selected, and
      may disappear forever. Fortunately, if you make this mistake,
      you can undo a translation by immediately selecting <b>Undo
      Translation</b> in the Options menu. <b>Undo Translation</b>
      only works for the last <b>Translate Selection...</b>
      performed. Remember to check results immediately after
      translating a selection in case undoing the operation is
      needed.</p>

      <p><b>To retain your changes, please remember to save your
      Panel!</b></p><!--#include virtual="/Footer.shtml" -->
