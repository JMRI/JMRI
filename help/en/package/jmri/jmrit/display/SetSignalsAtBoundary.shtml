      <h1>Set Signals at Block Boundary</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tool provides an automated procedure for assigning
      signals to a block boundary not associated with a turnout or
      a level crossing. This occurs when track segments from
      different blocks join at an anchor point. If requested, this
      tool will place signal icons on the panel at the specified
      block boundary, and will set up Simple Signal Logic for the
      specified signal heads. Prior to accessing this tool, blocks
      must be defined for signaled regions of track on the panel,
      and the required signal heads must be in the Signal Head
      Table. This tool only works correctly when track through the
      anchor point is vertical or horizontal (or mostly vertical or
      horizontal), so design your panel accordingly.</p>

      <p>When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of
      names of the two blocks whose boundary is to be signaled, and
      for entry of names (system or user) of one or two signal
      heads to be assigned to the block boundary. For each signal
      head, check boxes are available for selecting whether an icon
      is to be placed on the panel, and whether Simple Signal Logic
      is to be created for the signal head. Regardless of whether
      icons are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will
      record that the entered signal heads are assigned to the
      specified block boundary.</p>

      <h2>The Set Signals at Block Boundary Dialog</h2>

      <p>In the top two Block Name fields, enter the names of the
      two blocks that join at the block boundary. If the tool
      cannot find blocks with those names on the panel, an error
      message results. Also, if the two blocks don't join at an
      anchor point on the panel, an error message results.</p>

      <p>Signal Head names (either system or user) are entered in
      the next section. At least one signal head name should be
      entered. If signal heads at this block boundary have been
      entered previously, click <b>Get Saved</b> to retrieve the
      signal head names previously entered. The upper entry,
      <b>East (or South) Bound</b>, is for the signal head seen by
      an east-bound train (or south-bound train if the track is
      vertical). "East-bound" refers to a train proceeding from
      left to right <i>on the panel</i> at the block boundary.
      Similarly, "south-bound" refers to a train proceeding from
      top to bottom <i>on the panel</i>. Likewise, the second
      signal head entry, <b>West(or North) Bound</b>, is for a
      signal head seen by a west-bound (or north-bound) train.
      Because the signal icons only look decent for horizontal or
      vertical track, you should set up your panel so that block
      boundaries occur on track that is almost horizontal or almost
      vertical.</p>

      <p>Note: If there was a signal head previously assigned to
      one of the two positions, and you enter a <i>different</i>
      signal head in the same place, the new signal head will
      replace the previous signal head, and the icon of the
      previous signal head (if there is one) will be deleted from
      the panel.</p>

      <p>Check <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> to request that an
      icon for a signal head be placed on the panel at the block
      boundary. This tool can only place a signal icon on track
      that is almost vertical or almost horizontal. If this is not
      so, a message is printed, and you should place the signal
      icon manually using the Layout Editor tool bar. Regardless,
      the signal head name is assigned to the block boundary.</p>

      <p>Check <b>Set up Logic</b> to request that the tool set up
      a Simple Signal Logic for a signal head. The tool will create
      the logic and automatically fill in entries from the
      information available. If the tool does not have enough
      information available to set up the logic, a message results,
      and you will have to return later after more signals have
      been assigned to turnouts and block boundaries on the
      panel.</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <p>When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within
      a block until it finds a signal at the end of the block away
      from the block boundary being signaled. If your layout
      contains sections that are signaled and sections that are
      not, to get this tool to set up logic correctly, you may have
      to place a virtual signal (a signal that does not correspond
      to an actual signal on the layout) at the unsignaled end of
      the block that connects a section of track that is signaled
      with track that is not signaled. If a block ends with an end
      bumper, no signal is required at the end bumper end.</p>

      <p>If a block has an internal turnout (the turnout, and the
      track segments at its throat and continuing legs are within
      the block), the program will expect signals at that turnout
      even if it's not at the end of the block. However, at times
      the user may not want to signal a seldom used turnout within
      a block. When following track through a block, the program
      will skip over unsignaled internal turnouts if <b>Skip
      Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</b> is checked in the Layout
      Editor <b>Tools</b> menu. It will always, however, warn that
      it is doing so. <b>Use this option with caution.</b> There is
      no signal protecting against a skipped turnout being set
      incorrectly, so if an unsignaled internal turnout is not set
      correctly, derailed trains could result.</p>

      <p>This tool sets up three-aspect signaling. If you have a
      special situation at a signal, or would like four aspect
      signaling or approach lighting you will have to edit the
      information entered by the tool. The Simple Signal Logic
      dialog can be accessed from the popup menu of the signal
      icon. If your special situation cannot be handled by Simple
      Signal Logic, you should refer to Logix to tailor the signal
      logic to your needs.</p><!--#include virtual="/Footer" -->
