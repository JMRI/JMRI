      <h1>Set Signals at Block Boundary</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tool provides an automated procedure for assigning signals to a block boundary not
      associated with a turnout or a level crossing. This occurs when track segments from different
      blocks join at an anchor point. If requested, this tool will place signal icons on the panel
      at the specified block boundary, and will set up Simple Signal Logic for the specified signal
      heads. Prior to accessing this tool, blocks must be defined for signaled regions of track on
      the panel, and the required signal heads must be in the Signal Head Table. This tool only
      works correctly when track through the anchor point is vertical or horizontal (or mostly
      vertical or horizontal), so design your panel accordingly.</p>

      <p>When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of names of the two blocks whose
      boundary is to be signaled, and for entry of names (system or user) of one or two signal
      heads to be assigned to the block boundary. For each signal head, check boxes are available
      for selecting whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and whether Simple Signal Logic
      is to be created for the signal head. Regardless of whether icons are placed or logic is
      created, Layout Editor will record that the entered signal heads are assigned to the
      specified block boundary.</p>

      <h2>The Set Signals at Block Boundary Dialog</h2>

      <p>In the top two Block Name fields, enter the names of the two blocks that join at the block
      boundary. If the tool cannot find blocks with those names on the panel, an error message
      results. Also, if the two blocks don't join at an anchor point on the panel, an error message
      results.</p>

      <p>Signal Head names (either system or user) are entered in the next section. At least one
      signal head name should be entered. If signal heads at this block boundary have been entered
      previously, click <strong>Get Saved</strong> to retrieve the signal head names previously
      entered. The upper entry, <strong>East (or South) Bound</strong>, is for the signal head seen
      by an east-bound train (or south-bound train if the track is vertical). "East-bound" refers
      to a train proceeding from left to right <em>on the panel</em> at the block boundary.
      Similarly, "south-bound" refers to a train proceeding from top to bottom <em>on the
      panel</em>. Likewise, the second signal head entry, <strong>West(or North) Bound</strong>, is
      for a signal head seen by a west-bound (or north-bound) train. Because the signal icons only
      look decent for horizontal or vertical track, you should set up your panel so that block
      boundaries occur on track that is almost horizontal or almost vertical.</p>

      <p>Note: If there was a signal head previously assigned to one of the two positions, and you
      enter a <em>different</em> signal head in the same place, the new signal head will replace
      the previous signal head, and the icon of the previous signal head (if there is one) will be
      deleted from the panel.</p>

      <p>Check <strong>Add Signal Icon to Panel</strong> to request that an icon for a signal head
      be placed on the panel at the block boundary. This tool can only place a signal icon on track
      that is almost vertical or almost horizontal. If this is not so, a message is printed, and
      you should place the signal icon manually using the Layout Editor tool bar. Regardless, the
      signal head name is assigned to the block boundary.</p>

      <p>Check <strong>Set up Logic</strong> to request that the tool set up a Simple Signal Logic
      for a signal head. The tool will create the logic and automatically fill in entries from the
      information available. If the tool does not have enough information available to set up the
      logic, a message results, and you will have to return later after more signals have been
      assigned to turnouts and block boundaries on the panel.</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <p>When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within a block until it finds a signal
      at the end of the block away from the block boundary being signaled. If your layout contains
      sections that are signaled and sections that are not, to get this tool to set up logic
      correctly, you may have to place a virtual signal (a signal that does not correspond to an
      actual signal on the layout) at the unsignaled end of the block that connects a section of
      track that is signaled with track that is not signaled. If a block ends with an end bumper,
      no signal is required at the end bumper end.</p>

      <p>If a block has an internal turnout (the turnout, and the track segments at its throat and
      continuing legs are within the block), the program will expect signals at that turnout even
      if it's not at the end of the block. However, at times the user may not want to signal a
      seldom used turnout within a block. When following track through a block, the program will
      skip over unsignaled internal turnouts if <strong>Skip Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</strong>
      is checked in the Layout Editor <strong>Tools</strong> menu. It will always, however, warn
      that it is doing so. <strong>Use this option with caution.</strong> There is no signal
      protecting against a skipped turnout being set incorrectly, so if an unsignaled internal
      turnout is not set correctly, derailed trains could result.</p>

      <p>This tool sets up three-aspect signaling. If you have a special situation at a signal, or
      would like four aspect signaling or approach lighting you will have to edit the information
      entered by the tool. The Simple Signal Logic dialog can be accessed from the popup menu of
      the signal icon. If your special situation cannot be handled by Simple Signal Logic, you
      should refer to Logix to tailor the signal logic to your needs.</p>
