      <h1>Scale/Translate Track Diagram</h1>

      <p>The Scale/Translate Track Diagram dialog provides for scaling and translating a track
      diagram in a panel created using Layout Editor.</p>

      <p>To translate your track diagram in the panel window, enter the amount to translate in the
      <em>x</em> (horizontal) and <em>y</em> (vertical) directions. The units are pixels--the same
      units shown in the <em>x,y</em> position display in the Layout Editor tool bar. For no
      translation in either direction enter zero. For horizontal translation, enter a negative
      number to move the track diagram left that number of pixels; enter a positive number to move
      right. For vertical translation, enter a negative number to move the track diagram up by that
      number of pixels; enter a positive number to move the track diagram down. To undo a previous
      translation, simply enter the same numbers with opposite signs.</p>

      <p>To scale your track diagram, enter scale factors for the vertical (<em>y</em>) and/or
      horizontal (<em>x</em>) directions. All scaling is relative to a fixed point at the upper
      left of your panel. For no scaling in either direction, enter 1.0 for a scale factor. Enter a
      number less than 1.0 to reduce the size of the track diagram; enter a number greater than 1.0
      to increase the size of the track diagram.</p>

      <p><strong>Notes:</strong>
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Translation is performed before scaling, so enter translation units appropriately.</li>

        <li>Scaling is not perfect. You may need to adjust the alignment of some items after
        scaling your track diagram.</li>

        <li>Scaling is not easily reversed, so consider saving your panel prior to scaling to allow
        easy return to the previous size if you don't like the scaled panel.</li>

        <li>Layout Editor keeps track of scale factors that you have applied. When you add a new
        turnout after scaling, that turnout will be created at the new scale.</li>

        <li>The positions of icons and labels are not translated or scaled. Only the track diagram
        drawing is scaled and translated.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>To retain your changes, please remember to save your panel!</strong>
