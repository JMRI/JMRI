      <h1>Scale/Translate Track Diagram</h1>

      <p>The Scale/Translate Track Diagram dialog provides for
      scaling and translating a track diagram in a panel created
      using Layout Editor.</p>

      <p>To translate your track diagram in the panel window, enter
      the amount to translate in the <i>x</i> (horizontal) and
      <i>y</i> (vertical) directions. The units are pixels--the
      same units shown in the <i>x,y</i> position display in the
      Layout Editor tool bar. For no translation in either
      direction enter zero. For horizontal translation, enter a
      negative number to move the track diagram left that number of
      pixels; enter a positive number to move right. For vertical
      translation, enter a negative number to move the track
      diagram up by that number of pixels; enter a positive number
      to move the track diagram down. To undo a previous
      translation, simply enter the same numbers with opposite
      signs.</p>

      <p>To scale your track diagram, enter scale factors for the
      vertical (<i>y</i>) and/or horizontal (<i>x</i>) directions.
      All scaling is relative to a fixed point at the upper left of
      your panel. For no scaling in either direction, enter 1.0 for
      a scale factor. Enter a number less than 1.0 to reduce the
      size of the track diagram; enter a number greater than 1.0 to
      increase the size of the track diagram.</p>

      <p><b>Notes:</b></p>

        <ol>
        <li>Translation is performed before scaling, so enter
        translation units appropriately.</li>

        <li>Scaling is not perfect. You may need to adjust the
        alignment of some items after scaling your track diagram.</li>

        <li>Scaling is not easily reversed, so consider saving your
        panel prior to scaling to allow easy return to the previous
        size if you don't like the scaled panel.</li>

        <li>Layout Editor keeps track of scale factors that you
        have applied. When you add a new turnout after scaling, that
        turnout will be created at the new scale.</li>

        <li>The positions of icons and labels are not translated or
        scaled. Only the track diagram drawing is scaled and
        translated.</li>
        </ol>

      <p><b>To retain your changes, please remember to save your
      panel!</b></p>
