      <h1>The Slip Turnout Editor</h1>

      <p>The slip turnout editor handles turnouts that require more than one accessory (turnout)
      address and have more than two routes through the turnout.</p>

      <p>This includes ..</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Double Slips</li>

        <li>Single Slips</li>

        <li>Three way turnouts</li>

        <li>Scissor or Double Crossings</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The way icons are changed in the SlipTurnout Icon Editor is the same as they are changed
      in the other Icon Editors. The <strong>Change Icon...</strong>button and the Catalog function
      identically with other Icon Editors. The <strong>Find Icons</strong> menu and its items are
      also identical.</p>

      <p>See the <a href="IconAdder.shtml">Icon Editors page</a> and the <a href=
      "../catalog/ImageIndex.shtml">Image Index Editor page</a> for details on their use.</p>

      <h2>Contents of the SlipTurnout Icon Editor</h2>

      <p>Each type of "Slip" uses a fixed number of turnouts and routes. Typically each "Slip" uses
      two turnouts and has between three and four different routes.</p>

      <p>Each slip must have all the turnouts required added, when all the turnouts are assigned,
      the <strong>Add to Panel</strong> button will become active and it can be pressed to install
      the Slip into the Panel.</p>

      <p>To select the type of Slip complex that is being used, use the radio buttons at the top of
      the window.</p>

      </p>

      <p>Details about how each type of slip should be configured and operate can be found
      below.</p>

      <h3>Double Slip</h3>
      <img src="images/DoubleSlip.png" class="floatRight" alt="double slip">
      <p>The Double Slip, uses a pair of turnouts to set the four possible routes that are
      available. Simply drag a row from the Turnout table to place into the corresponding West or
      East undefined position on the slip. When the turnout is dropped on to the label, it will
      display the turnout name.</p>

      <h3>Single Slip</h3>
      <img src="images/SingleSlip.png" class="floatRight" alt="single slip">
      <p>The Single Slip works in very much the same way as the Double Slip in that it requires a
      pair of turnouts to be selected for the West and East side of the Slip. However it has a
      further option, which is to select which way the slip routes.</p>
      <img src="images/SingleOptions.png" alt="single slip options">
      <p>Use the radio button to select if the slip takes the upper or lower route, making the
      change will automatically change the icon in the slip position to suit.</p>

      <h3>Three Way Turnout</h3>
      <img src="images/ThreeWay.png" class="floatRight" alt="three way turnout">
      <p>With the Three Way Turnout, you require a pair of turnouts, one for the first throat, then
      another for the second.</p>
      <img src="images/ThreeWayOptions.png" alt="three way options">
      <p>You also need to determine which exit the first throat turnout relates to.</p>

      <h3>Scissor (Double) Crossing</h3>

      <p>The Scissor crossing can use either a pair of turnout address with diagonally opposite
      turnouts being wired together as one. Or it can use four turnout addresses, one for each
      corner of the scissor.</p>

      <p><strong>Note :</strong> The Scissor Crossing Icon does not allow for all routes to be set
      as crossing, this mainly due to the fact that in many instance setting a scissor crossing to
      this state will cause a short circuit. <img src="images/ScissorBy2.png" class="floatRight"
      alt="crossover"></p>

      <p>When a pair of turnouts is used, you place the turnout that is controlling the Upper West
      to Lower East route into the Right Hand Crossing panel, and the turnout address controlling
      the Lower West to Upper East route into the Left Hand Crossing Panel. <img src=
      "images/ScissorBy4.png" class="floatRight" alt="double crossover"></p>

      <p>When four turnouts are used, you need to place the four turnouts from the turnout table to
      the corresponding locations in the panel.</p>
