      <h1>The Slip Turnout Editor</h1>

      <p>The slip turnout editor handles turnouts that require more
      than one accessory (turnout) address and have more than two
      routes through the turnout.</p>

      <p>This includes ..</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Double Slips</li>

        <li>Single Slips</li>

        <li>Three way turnouts</li>

        <li>Scissor or Double Crossings</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The way icons are changed in the SlipTurnout Icon Editor
      is the same as they are changed in the other Icon Editors.
      The <b>Change Icon...</b>button and the Catalog function
      identically with other Icon Editors. The <b>Find Icons</b>
      menu and its items are also identical.</p>

      <p>See the <a href="IconAdder.shtml">Icon Editors page</a>
      and the <a href="../catalog/ImageIndex.shtml">Image Index
      Editor page</a> for details on their use.</p>

      <h2>Contents of the SlipTurnout Icon Editor</h2>

      <p>Each type of "Slip" uses a fixed number of turnouts and
      routes. Typically each "Slip" uses two turnouts and has
      between three and four different routes.</p>

      <p>Each slip must have all the turnouts required added, when
      all the turnouts are assigned, the <b>Add to Panel</b> button
      will become active and it can be pressed to install the Slip
      into the Panel.</p>

      <p>To select the type of Slip complex that is being used, use
      the radio buttons at the top of the window.</p>

      <p><img src="images/SlipOptions.png"></p>

      <p>Details about how each type of slip should be configured
      and operate can be found below.</p>

      <h3>Double Slip</h3><img src="images/DoubleSlip.png" align=
      "right">

      <p>The Double Slip, uses a pair of turnouts to set the four
      possible routes that are available. Simply drag a row from
      the Turnout table to place into the corresponding West or
      East undefined position on the slip. When the turnout is
      dropped on to the label, it will display the turnout
      name.</p>

      <h3>Single Slip</h3><img src="images/SingleSlip.png" align=
      "right">

      <p>The Single Slip works in very much the same way as the
      Double Slip in that it requires a pair of turnouts to be
      selected for the West and East side of the Slip. However it
      has a further option, which is to select which way the slip
      routes.</p><img src="images/SingleOptions.png">

      <p>Use the radio button to select if the slip takes the upper
      or lower route, making the change will automatically change
      the icon in the slip position to suit.</p>

      <h3>Three Way Turnout</h3><img src="images/ThreeWay.png"
      align="right">

      <p>With the Three Way Turnout, you require a pair of
      turnouts, one for the first throat, then another for the
      second.</p><img src="images/ThreeWayOptions.png">

      <p>You also need to determine which exit the first throat
      turnout relates to.</p>

      <h3>Scissor (Double) Crossing</h3>

      <p>The Scissor crossing can use either a pair of turnout
      address with diagonally opposite turnouts being wired
      together as one. Or it can use four turnout addresses, one
      for each corner of the scissor.</p>

      <p><b>Note :</b> The Scissor Crossing Icon does not allow for
      all routes to be set as crossing, this mainly due to the fact
      that in many instance setting a scissor crossing to this
      state will cause a short circuit. <img src=
      "images/ScissorBy2.png" align="right"></p>

      <p>When a pair of turnouts is used, you place the turnout
      that is controlling the Upper West to Lower East route into
      the Right Hand Crossing panel, and the turnout address
      controlling the Lower West to Upper East route into the Left
      Hand Crossing Panel. <img src="images/ScissorBy4.png" align=
      "right"></p>

      <p>When four turnouts are used, you need to place the four
      turnouts from the turnout table to the corresponding
      locations in the panel.</p>
