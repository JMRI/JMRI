      <h1>Set Signals at Throat-to-Throat Turnouts</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tool provides an automated procedure for assigning
      signals to two turnouts in close proximity oriented
      throat-to-throat, with the throats connected by a single
      track segment. This arrangement is used where four tracks
      come together in a small area, so closely that no signals are
      placed at the turnout throats. Such a setup is used to model
      a double-slip turnout, for example, but can also occur in
      other contexts. Each of the two turnouts may be either
      right-hand (RH), left hand (LH) or wye (WYE) turnouts.
      Schematically, the final throat-to-throat setup looks as
      shown below:</p><a href="./images/DoubleXover8.gif"><img src=
      "./images/TToTTurnout8.gif" align="center" width="280"
      height="75" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>

      <p>If requested, this tool will place signal icons on the
      panel at the continuing and diverging legs of the two
      turnouts, and will set up control logic for specified signal
      heads. Either one or two signal heads may be placed at each
      leg of the turnouts. The continuing leg is the track
      connected when the turnout is "CLOSED", and the diverging leg
      is the track connected when the turnout is "THROWN".</p>

      <p>Prior to selecting this tool, both turnouts must be on the
      panel connected throat-to-throat by a single track segment,
      and required signal heads must be in the Signal Head Table.
      This tool places signal heads only when the main track of the
      turnouts is vertical or horizontal (or mostly vertical or
      horizontal) on the panel, so design your panel accordingly.
      The control logic created by this tool only works correctly
      if each of the track segments connected to the continuing and
      diverging legs of the two turnouts is assigned to a different
      block. It works best if the track segment connecting the two
      throats and the two turnouts are in a fifth different block,
      but this is not required.</p>

      <p>When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of
      the names (system or user) of the two turnouts, and the names
      (system or user) of four to eight signal heads to be assigned
      to the two turnouts. You may enter both turnout names, or
      enter only one turnout and allow the program to find the
      other. To check that the second turnout has been found
      correctly, click the <b>Get Saved</b> button.</p>

      <p>For each signal head, check boxes are available for
      selecting whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and
      whether control logic is to be created for the signal head.
      Regardless of whether icons are placed or logic is created,
      Layout Editor will record that the entered signal heads are
      assigned to the specified turnouts.</p>

      <p>When two turnouts are setup using this throat-to-throat
      set up tool, Layout Editor keeps track of that fact. So if
      you select <b>Set Signals...</b> in the popup menu of either
      turnout, you will return to this dialog with both turnouts
      filled in. If you should later desire to 'unlink' the two
      turnouts and add signals at their throats, for each of the
      turnouts, select <b>Set Signals at Turnout...</b>, fill in
      the turnout name manually, enter signal heads, and click
      <b>Done</b>.</p>

      <h3>The Set Signals at Throat-to-Throat Turnouts Dialog</h3>

      <p>In the <b>Turnout 1 Name</b> and <b>Turnout 2 Name</b>
      field, enter the name (system or user) of one or two of the
      turnouts. If only one is entered, the tool will find the
      other when the <b>Done</b> or <b>Get Saved</b> buttons are
      clicked. If the tool cannot find the second turnout, or if
      the two entered turnouts are not on the panel or not
      connected throat-to-throat by a single track segment, an
      error message results. It makes no difference which turnout
      you call <b>Turnout 1</b> and which you call <b>Turnout
      2</b>.</p>

      <p>Signal Head names (either system or user) are entered in
      the next section. If signal heads at these turnouts have been
      entered previously, click <b>Get Saved</b> to retrieve the
      signal head names previously entered. The tool provides for
      entry of two signals at each of the continuing and diverging
      tracks of each turnout (as shown in the figure above). These
      signal heads show the status for moving to the continuing or
      diverging tracks of the other turnout. First the signal heads
      located at <b>Turnout 1 - continuing track</b> are entered.
      The <b>continuing track</b> signal head is required, but the
      <b>diverging track</b> entry is optional. If only the
      <b>continuing track</b> signal head is entered, the tool
      assumes that head is signaling both tracks of the other
      turnout, similar to when only one signal head is placed at
      the throat of a single turnout.</p>

      <p>Next the signal heads located at <b>Turnout 1 - diverging
      track</b> are entered. Remember this is the turnout 1 leg
      that is connected when the turnout is set THROWN. When two
      heads are entered, the head closest to the points signals the
      status of the continuing track (the turnout CLOSED track) of
      the other turnout. Similarly, the signal heads located at
      <b>Turnout 2 - continuing track</b> and <b>Turnout 2 -
      diverging track</b> are entered.</p>

      <p>If there was a signal head previously assigned to any
      position, and you enter a <i>different</i> signal head in the
      same place, the new signal head will replace the previous
      signal head, and the icon of the previous signal head (if
      there was one) will be deleted from the panel. Similarly, if
      you replace a previously assigned <b>Diverging</b> signal
      head with a blank entry (no signal head), the previous entry
      is deleted, and there will not be any signal head at that
      position. <b>If a signal head is changed, you must redo any
      logic that involves it.</b> In particular, if you delete a
      diverging signal head, you must redo the logic for the
      continuing signal head located on the same track.</p>

      <p>Check <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> to request that an
      icon for a signal head be placed on the panel at the turnout
      position indicated. This tool can only place a signal icon on
      turnouts that are almost vertical or almost horizontal. If
      this is not so, a message is printed, and you should place
      the signal icon manually using the Layout Editor tool bar.
      Regardless, the signal head name is assigned to the specified
      turnout position. This assignment is important for setting up
      logic for other signals down the track.</p>

      <p>Check <b>Set up Logic</b> to request that the tool set up
      signal control logic for a signal head. For each of these
      signal heads, the tool creates a Simple Signal Logic for that
      head, and in addition creates a Logix that ensures that the
      turnout the signal is placed on is not thrown against the leg
      the signal is placed on. The tool will attempt to setup the
      logic and automatically fill in entries from the information
      available. If the tool does not have enough information
      available to set up the logic, a message results, and you
      will have to return later after more blocks (with occupancy
      sensors) and/or signals have been assigned to turnouts and
      block boundaries on the panel.</p>

      <h3>Notes</h3>

      <p>The tool will set up the Simple Signal Logic to set all
      signals red if the block containing the two turnouts and
      their connector track is occupied. If this is not what you
      want, you should edit the Simple Signal Logic by removing the
      occupancy sensor of that block.</p>

      <p>When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within
      a block until it finds a signal at the end of the block away
      from the turnout being signaled. If your layout contains
      sections that are signaled and sections that are not, to get
      this tool to set up logic correctly, you may have to create
      and assign a virtual signal (a signal that does not
      correspond to an actual signal on the layout) at the
      unsignaled end of the block that connects track that is
      signaled with track that is not signaled. (You do not need to
      add an icon for the virtual signal to your panel, but it must
      exist in your signal head table, and must be assigned to a
      turnout or block boundary using a Set Signals ... tool.) If a
      block ends with an end bumper, no virtual signal is required
      at the end bumper end.</p>

      <p>If a block has an internal turnout (the turnout, and the
      track segments at its throat and continuing legs are within
      the block), the program will expect signals at that turnout
      even if it's not at the end of the block. However, at times
      the user may not want to signal a seldom used turnout within
      a block. When following track through a block, the program
      will skip over unsignaled internal turnouts if <b>Skip
      Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</b> is checked in the Layout
      Editor <b>Tools</b> menu. It will always, however, warn that
      it is doing so. <b>Use this option with caution.</b> There is
      no signal protecting against a skipped turnout being set
      incorrectly, so if an unsignaled internal turnout is not set
      correctly, derailed trains could result.</p>

      <p>When setting up the Logix used in the control logic, the
      tool creates an internal sensor to communicate with the
      Simple Signal Logic. The Logix will appear in your Logix
      table, and the internal sensor will appear in your sensor
      table. The system names of the Logix and internal sensor will
      be, IX or IS followed by TTT_X_HHH, where TTT is the system
      name of the turnout where the signal head is located, X is
      either C or T depending on whether the signal head is located
      on the continuing (CLOSED) track or the diverging (THROWN)
      track, and HHH is the system name of the signal head. The
      purpose of this Logix is to ensure that the aspect of the
      signal head will be red if the turnout where the signal head
      is located is switched against the track the signal is
      on.</p>

      <p>This tool sets up three-aspect signaling. When a signal
      head is showing the status when moving to a diverging route,
      the tool will set up for limited speed (the least restrictive
      aspect is not green, but yellow), and the signal will show
      yellow when it otherwise would show green. You can change
      this with a simple edit (see below).</p>

      <p>If you have a special situation at a signal, you may have
      to edit the information entered by this tool into the Simple
      Signal Logic. If you would like four-aspect signaling, you
      can easily manually edit the logic to achieve this.
      Similarly, by simple hand edits of the logic, you can add
      approach lighting. If you don't want yellow when moving to
      the diverging route, but prefer green, open the Simple Signal
      Logic for the head you want to change and uncheck <b>Limited
      Speed</b>. The Simple Signal Logic dialog can be accessed
      from the popup menu of each signal icon. If your special
      situation cannot be handled by Simple Signal Logic, you
      should refer to Logix to tailor the signal logic to your
      needs.</p>
