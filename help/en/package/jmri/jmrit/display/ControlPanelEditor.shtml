      <h1>The Control Panel Editor</h1>

      <p><strong>Control Panel Editor</strong> (CPE) is simply an alternative view and controller
      with exactly the same content data as <strong><a href="PanelEditor.shtml">Panel
      Editor</a></strong> (PE). Storage and loading can be done from either editor. You may change
      the view and control of your Panel whenever and as often as you please (explained below). The
      editor used to store the panel will be the editor used at the next load of your Panel.</p>

      <h3>Differences in the View between Editors</h3>
      Panel Editor has a separate window for its editing functions. Control Panel Editor does not.
      In Panel Editor the <strong>Edit</strong> menu opens an edit window. In Control Panel Editor
      the <strong>Edit</strong> menu adds three additional menus to the panel:
      <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Options</strong>, <strong>Zoom</strong>, <strong>Add
      Items</strong>, <strong>Circuit Builder</strong> and <strong>Draw Shapes</strong>.
      <h3>Changing the View between Editors</h3>
      In either editor, when in edit mode, the last item in the <strong>File</strong> menu is
      <strong>Change view to "xx"</strong> ("xx" being the other editor). Selecting this item
      switches the view from one editor mode to the other editor mode.
      <h2>Control Panel Editor Menus</h2>
      When in Edit mode, the following menus are displayed:
      <h3>File Menu</h3>
      The <strong>File</strong> menu changes its items between edit mode and operating mode. In
      edit mode the items are the same as the items in the File menu of the Panel Editor's edit
      window with a few additional items. They are:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>New Panel</strong>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Store ALL table content and panels...</strong> {<em>Old: <strong>Store
          Panels...</strong></em>} <span class="since">since 4.23.3</span> See <a href=
          "../../../../html/apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">Loading and Storing Your Work</a>.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Store Image Index</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Rename Panel</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Create/Edit Image Index</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Change View to Panel Editor</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Delete this Panel...</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Close Editor</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>In operating mode Control Panel Editor's File menu has only one item: <strong>Open
      Editor</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Edit Menu</h3>

      <p>This menu supports <strong>Cut</strong>, <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong>
      with the system clipboard. Cut and Copy will place a copy of a selection item or group into
      the clipboard. This feature allows copying selections from one panel to different Control
      Editor panel.</p>

      <p>It also has a menu items.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Select type...</strong> - Select all items of a given type, e.g. Sensors,
        etc</li>

        <li><strong>Select Level...</strong> - Select all items of a given display level.</li>

        <li><strong>Select All</strong> - Select all items.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Options Menu</h3>

      <p>The items in this menu are similar to the checkboxes in Panel Editor's edit window with a
      few additional items and features. As with PE, CPE can globally set repositioning and control
      attributes. However CPE preserves the individual repositioning and controlling attributes of
      items and will restore them when global overriding is removed.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Override individual Position & Control settings</strong> item enables or
        disables the next two menu items</li>

        <li><strong>All panel items can be repositioned</strong> - globally /lock/unlock all
        items.</li>

        <li><strong>All panel items control layout</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      When <strong>Override individual Position & Control settings</strong> is unchecked, locking
      or unlocking individual icon positions is done - likewise for enabling or disabling an item's
      control of layout devices. When <strong>Override individual Position & Control
      settings</strong> is checked, the next two menu items perform as they do in Panel Editor -
      changing these attributes for all panel items. However, in control Panel Editor the
      individual locking and control settings for each item are remembered.
      <p>Unchecking the <strong>Override individual Position & Control settings</strong> item will
      return the individual item settings to their previous settings. In Panel Editor, checking
      <strong>All panel items can be repositioned</strong> and <strong>All panel items control
      layout</strong> will permanently set all panel items and restoration cannot be done.</p>

      <p>The menu also has items for setting <strong>Panel Scrollbars</strong> and to <strong>Show
      Tooltips</strong>.  See <a href="Tooltips.shtml">Tooltips</a> for more information.</p>

      <h3>Zoom Menu</h3>
      The <strong>Zoom(percentage)...</strong> item will enlarge or reduce the panel size.
      <p>The <strong>Zoom to Fit</strong> item will enlarge or reduce the display of all panel
      items in the panel to fit within the panel window without the use of scroll bars. This can be
      useful if your panel design happens to be slightly larger that what you can fit on the
      screen. Rather than using scroll bars to see all items on the panel, "Zoom to Fit" will
      reduce the display to fit the panel window. Conversely, it will expand the display to fit the
      panel window. If you resize the panel window, then you should repeat "Zoom to Fit" to resize
      the display to fit the new panel window dimensions.</p>

      <h3>Add Items Menu</h3>

      <p>The <strong>Item Palette</strong> menu item opens a tabbed window which allows you to add
      item icons to the panel. Each item type has a tab in the window. Adding items is done by drag
      and drop. Iconic items may have multiple sets of icons to choose from. Icon sets may be
      customized and added or deleted to suit the user. Details may be found at <a href=
      "ItemPalette.shtml">The Item Palette</a> help.<br>
      Note that the Item Palette can also be opened with the accelerator key, Control P. The icons
      are displayed on the background of the last editor to call the Item Palette. Once visible,
      use the bottom of the pane use the "Show on:" combo box to slect a different background.</p>

      <p>The Palette in Control Panel Editor does not support the
      <strong>Slip/3-Way/Scissor</strong> turnout icons that are available from Panel Editor.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Occupancy Table</strong> menu item opens a window where occupancy block (also
      called track circuits), <em>OBlocks</em> can be defined , along with <em>Portals</em> that
      join OBlocks and paths <em>OPath</em> that are trackage routes which traverse the OBlock.
      More information may be found at <a href="../logix/OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block
      Tables</a>.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Item Table List</strong> menu item opens the device table list. The menu item
      can also be invoked with the accelerator key, Control T.</p>

      <h3>Warrants</h3>

      <p>The items under this menu are help files for defining Occupancy Blocks and using them to
      define Warrants. When two or more Occupancy Blocks are defined, additional menu items for
      defining and using Warrants will appear. These menu items are described in <a href=
      "../logix/Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>.</p>

      <h3>Circuit Builder</h3>

      <p>This menu appears when two or more Occupancy Blocks are defined. The items under this menu
      provide a graphic user interface (GUI) for defining Occupancy Blocks, Portals and Paths, that
      is, a track circuit. Descriptions of the menu items are found in <a href=
      "CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a>.</p>

      <h3>Draw Shapes</h3>
      This menu allows drawing of various geometric shapes.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Draw Rectangle</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Draw Round Rectangle</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Draw Polygon</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Draw Circle</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Draw Ellipse</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Disable Selecting Shapes</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      With the exception of Draw Polygon, each of the draw items is made with a mouse click and
      drag. Polygon shapes are made with a sequence of mouse clicks and the polygon terminated with
      a double click or pressing the 'Done' button.
      <p>When a shape is created or edited a small pane is displayed to set shape attributes.
      Colors can be chosen for both the outline and the fill. Also the line thickness of the
      outline and the transparency of the fill can be set. Precise dimensions can be set with the
      text fields at the bottom.</p>

      <p>Shapes can be controlled with a sensor, by entering a Sensor name in the
      <strong>Visibility/Level Control</strong> text field. Activating the sensor may then be used
      to hide or change the level of the shape when in operating (not editing) mode. This feature
      can be used to mask and unmask help information to your panel or to highlight items.</p>

      <h2>Quick Reference for using the Mouse</h2>
      When in edit mode, the following keystroke patterns are available:
      <ul>
        <li>Click(left) - Select and Drag top item</li>

        <li>Shift-Click(left) - Select and Drag item under top item, i.e. 2nd item</li>

        <li>Control-Click(left) - Select and Drag bottom item</li>

        <li>Control-Shift-Click(left) - Show list of all selected items, for superimposed item
        stacks</li>

        <li>Click(right) - Select and Popup item property changes</li>

        <li>Shift-Click(right) - Select and Popup item property changes for 2nd item</li>

        <li>Control-Click(right) - Select and Popup item property changes for bottom item</li>

        <li>Control-Shift-Click(right) - Select and Popup item property changes of selected item
        from stack<br>
        Note: For Control-Shift-Click, keep holding the Control and Shift keys down through the
        entire process of selecting the item and the subsequent drag or popup on that item.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mouse operation in Control Panel Editor</h2>
      Control Panel Editor does not implement the rollover highlighting found in Panel Editor.
      <h3>Selection</h3>
      In Control Panel Editor selection is done with a simple click. Items are deselected with
      Control click
      <p>When items are stacked, Shift-click will select the second-most item in the layer.
      Control-click will select the bottom-most item in the stack. If the items are stacked over a
      background item, Control-click will select the bottom-most item above the background.
      Control-click over only the background will select the background icon.</p>

      <h3>Multiple Selection</h3>
      As with Panel Editor, a selection group can be made using the "selection fence" - a dotted
      red rectangle that will select all the items completely <strong><em>within</em></strong> the
      fence. If the <strong>Shift</strong> key is held down while creating a selection fence, then
      all items that <strong><em>intersect</em></strong> the dotted red rectangle are selected.
      This can be a useful feature when items are located at the top and left borders of the panel.
      <p>Add or delete items from a selection group by holding the <strong>Control</strong> key
      down when selecting the item.</p>

      <h3>Dragging selections</h3>
      Drag selection or selection group with the mouse button held down on any item in the group.
      <p>A background icon (i.e. an icon at level 1) can be moved by dragging it with the control
      key held down.</p>

      <h2>Duplicating Selections in Control Panel Editor</h2>
      Copying an item or selection group is done by bringing up the popup for one of the selected
      items. When the <strong>Duplicate</strong> popup menu item is clicked, a Copy of the
      selection group is made on top of the original selections. Drag this copy to wherever you
      wish to place the copy. The original selection is now deselected and remains at its original
      postion. The copy procedure can be repeated on the newly positioned copy to continue to make
      more copies.
      <h2>Item Popups in Control Panel Editor</h2>
      Right click (meta-click on Mac or Linux) brings up the popup menu for the item.
      <p>Hold the <strong>Control</strong> key down to open the popup menu for a background
      item.</p>

      <h3>Edit Text Attributes</h3>
      The <strong>Edit Text Attributes</strong> popup item opens a dialog to set any of the item's
      text attributes.
      <h3>Multiple Selection Editing</h3>

      <p>When a popup menu item is invoked from an item that is a member of a selection group, all
      of the edited values that were made in the popup are applied to all members of the selection
      group if that value is relevant to the member. For example, if the font size is changed on
      one of the items in the selection group then the font size is changed in all items in the
      group. If say, a fast clock were included in this group, then no change would be made to the
      clock.</p>
