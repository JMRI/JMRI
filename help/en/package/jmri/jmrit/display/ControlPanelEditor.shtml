      <h1>The Control Panel Editor</h1>

      <h2>Quick Reference Guide for Mouse</h2>When in edit mode,
      the following keystroke patterns are available:

      <ul>
        <li>Click(left) - Select and Drag top item</li>

        <li>Shift-Click(left) - Select and Drag item under top
        item, i.e. 2nd item</li>

        <li>Control-Click(left) - Select and Drag bottom item</li>

        <li>Control-Shift-Click(left) - Show list of all selected
        items, for superimposed item stacks</li>

        <li>Click(right) - Select and Popup item property
        changes</li>

        <li>Shift-Click(right) - Select and Popup item property
        changes for 2nd item</li>

        <li>Control-Click(right) - Select and Popup item property
        changes for bottom item</li>

        <li>Control-Shift-Click(right) - Select and Popup item
        property changes of selected item from stack</li>
      </ul>Note: For Control-Shift-Click, keep holding the Control
      and Shift keys down through the entire process of selecting
      the item and the subsequent drag or popup on that item.

      <p><b>Control Panel Editor</b> (CPE) is simply an alternative
      view and controller with exactly the same content data as
      <b>Panel Editor</b> (PE). You may change the view and control
      of your Panel whenever and as often as you please. Storage
      and loading can be done from either editor. The editor used
      to store the panel will be the editor used at the next
      load.</p>

      <h2>Changing the View between Editors</h2>In either editor,
      when in edit mode, the last item in the <b>File</b> menu is
      <b>Change view to "xx"</b> ("xx" being the other editor).
      Selecting this item switches the view from one editor mode to
      the other editor mode.

      <h2>Differences in the View between Editors</h2>Panel Editor
      has a separate window for its editing functions. Control
      Panel Editor does not. In Panel Editor the <b>Edit</b> menu
      opens an edit window. In Control Panel Editor the <b>Edit</b>
      menu adds three additional menus to the panel: <b>File</b>,
      <b>Options</b>, <b>Zoom</b>, <b>Add Items</b>, <b>Circuit
      Builder</b> and <b>Draw Shapes</b>.

      <h2>Control Panel Editor Menus</h2>When in Edit mode, the
      following menus are displayed.

      <h3>File Menu</h3>
      The <b>File</b> menu changes its items
      between edit mode and operating mode. In edit mode the items
      are the same as the items in the File menu of the Panel
      Editor's edit window with a few additional items. They are:

      <ul>
        <li><b>New Panel</b></li>

        <li><b>Store Panels...</b></li>

        <li><b>Store Image Index</b></li>

        <li><b>Rename Panel</b></li>

        <li><b>Create/Edit Image Index</b></li>

        <li><b>Change View to Panel Editor</b></li>

        <li><b>Delete this Panel...</b></li>

        <li><b>Close Editor</b></li>
      </ul>

      <p>In operating mode Control Panel Editor's File menu has
      only one item: <b>Open Editor</b>.</p>

      <h3>Edit Menu</h3>

      <p>This menu supports <b>Cut</b>, <b>Copy</b> and
      <b>Paste</b> with the system clipboard. Cut and Copy will
      place a copy of a selection item or group into the clipboard.
      This feature allows copying selections from one panel to
      different Control Editor panel.</p>

      <p>It also has a menu items.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Select type...</b> - Select all items of a given
        type, e.g. Sensors, etc</li>

        <li><b>Select Level...</b> - Select all items of a given
        display level.</li>

        <li><b>Select All</b> - Select all items.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Options Menu</h3>The items in this menu are similar to
      the checkboxes in Panel Editor's edit window with a few
      additional items and features. As with PE, CPE can globally
      set repositioning and control attributes. However CPE
      preserves the individual repositioning and controlling
      attributes of items and will restore them when global
      overriding is removed.

      <ul>
        <li>The <b>Override individual Position &amp; Control
        settings</b> item enables or disables, the next two menu
        items</li>

        <li><b>All panel items can be repositioned</b> - globally
        /lock/unlock all items.</li>

        <li><b>All panel items control layout</b></li>
      </ul>When <b>Override individual Position &amp; Control
      settings</b> is unchecked, locking or unlocking individual
      icon positions is done - likewise for enabling or disabling
      an item's control of layout devices. When <b>Override
      individual Position &amp; Control settings</b> is checked,
      the next two menu items perform as they do in Panel Editor -
      changing these attributes for all panel items. However, in
      control Panel Editor the individual locking and control
      settings for each item are remembered.

      <p>Unchecking the <b>Override individual Position &amp;
      Control settings</b> item will return the individual item
      settings to their previous settings. In Panel Editor,
      checking <b>All panel items can be repositioned</b> and
      <b>All panel items control layout</b> will permanently set
      all panel items and restoration cannot be done.</p>

      <p>The menu also has items for setting <b>Panel
      Scrollbars</b> and to <b>Show Tooltips</b>.</p>

      <h3>Zoom Menu</h3>
      The <b>Zoom(percentage)...</b> item will
      enlarge or reduce the panel size.

      <p>The <b>Zoom to Fit</b> item will enlarge or reduce the
      display of all panel items in the panel to fit within the
      panel window without the use of scroll bars. This can be
      useful if your panel design happens to be slightly larger
      that what you can fit on the screen. Rather than using scroll
      bars to see all items on the panel, "Zoom to Fit" will reduce
      the display to fit the panel window. Conversely, it will
      expand the display to fit the panel window. If you resize the
      panel window, then you should repeat "Zoom to Fit" to resize
      the display to fit the new panel window dimensions.</p>

      <h3>Add Items Menu</h3>
      The <b>Item Palette</b> menu item opens
      a tabbed window which allows you to add item icons to the
      panel. Each item type has a tab in the window. Adding items
      is done by drag and drop. Iconic items may have multiple sets
      of icons to choose from. Icon sets may be customized and
      added or deleted to suit the user. Details may be found at
      <a href="ItemPalette.shtml">The Item Palette</a> help.<br>
      Note that the Item Palette can also be opened with the
      accelerator key, Control P. The icons are displayed on the
      background of the last editor to call the Item Palette.
      Once visible, use the bottom of the pane use the "Show on:"
      combo box to slect a different background.

      <p>The Palette in Control Panel Editor does not support the
      <b>Slip/3-Way/Scissor</b> turnout icons that are available
      from Panel Editor.</p>

      <p>The <b>Occupancy Table</b> menu item opens a window where
      occupancy block (also called track circuits), <i>OBlocks</i>
      can be defined , along with <i>Portals</i> that join OBlocks
      and paths <i>OPath</i> that are trackage routes which
      traverse the OBlock. More information may be found at
      <a href="../logix/OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block
      Tables</a>.</p>

      <p>The <b>Item Table List</b> menu item opens the device
      table list. The menu item can also be invoked with the
      accelerator key, Control T.</p>

      <h3>Warrants</h3>The items under this menu are help files for
      defining Occupancy Blocks and using the them to define
      Warrants. When two or more Occupancy Blocks are defined
      additional menu items for defining Warrants will appear.
      These menu items are described in <a href=
      "../logix/Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>. .

      <h3>Circuit Builder</h3>
      <p>This menu appears when two or more Occupancy Blocks are
      defined. The items under this menu provide
      a graphic user interface (GUI) for defining Occupancy Blocks,
      Portals and Paths, that is, a track circuit. Descriptions of
      the menu items are found in
      <a href="CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a>.</p>

      <h3>Draw Shapes</h3>
      This menu allows drawing of various geometric shapes.

      <ul>
        <li><b>Draw Rectangle</b></li>

        <li><b>Draw Round Rectangle</b></li>

        <li><b>Draw Polygon</b></li>

        <li><b>Draw Circle</b></li>

        <li><b>Draw Ellipse</b></li>

        <li><b>Disable Selecting Shapes</b></li>
      </ul>With the exception of Draw Polygon, each of the draw
      items is make with a mouse click and drag. Polygon shapes are
      made with a sequence of mouse clicks and the polygon
      terminated with a double click or pressing the 'Done' button.

      <p>When a shape is created or edited a window is displayed to
      set shape attributes. Colors can be chosen for both the
      outline and the fill. Also the line thickness of the outline
      and the transparency of the fill can be set. Precise
      dimensions can be set with the text fields at the bottom.</p>

      <p>Shapes can be controlled with a sensor, by entering a
      Sensor name in the <b>Visibility/Level Control</b> text
      field. Activating the sensor may then be used to hide or
      change the level of the shape when in operating (not editing)
      mode. This feature can be used to mask and unmask help
      information to your panel or to highlight items.</p>

      <h2>Mouse operation in Control Panel Editor</h2>
      Control Panel Editor does not implement the rollover
      highlighting found in Panel Editor.

      <h3>Selection</h3>
      In Control Panel Editor selection is done
      with a simple click. Items are deselected with Control click

      <p>When items are stacked, Shift-click will select the
      second-most item in the layer. Control-click will select the
      bottom-most item in the stack. If the items are stacked over
      a background item, Control-click will select the bottom-most
      item above the background. Control-click over only the
      background will select the background icon.</p>

      <h3>Multiple Selection</h3>
      As with Panel Editor, a selection
      group can be made using the "selection fence" - a dotted red
      rectangle that will select all the items completely
      <b><i>within</i></b> the fence. If the <b>Shift</b> key is
      held down while creating a selection fence, then all items
      that <b><i>intersect</i></b> the dotted red rectangle are
      selected. This can be a useful feature when items are located
      at the top and left borders of the panel.

      <p>Add or delete items from a selection group by holding the
      <b>Control</b> key down when selecting the item.</p>

      <h3>Dragging selections</h3>Drag selection or selection group
      with the mouse button held down on any item in the group.

      <p>A background icon (i.e. an icon at level 1) can be moved
      by dragging it with the control key held down.</p>

      <h2>Duplicating Selections Within Control Panel
      Editor</h2>
      Copying an item or selection group is done by
      bringing up the popup for one of the selected items. When the
      <b>Duplicate</b> popup menu item is clicked, a Copy of the
      selection group is made on top of the original selections.
      Drag this copy to wherever you wish to place the copy. The
      original selection is now deselected and remains at its
      original postion. The copy procedure can be repeated on the
      newly positioned copy to continue to make more copies.

      <h2>Item Popups in Control Panel Editor</h2>
      Right click (meta-click on Mac or Linux) brings up the
      popup menu for the item.

      <p>Hold the <b>Control</b> key down to open the popup menu
      for a background item.</p>

      <h3>Edit Text Attributes</h3>
      The <b>Edit Text Attributes</b> popup item opens a dialog
      to set any of the item's text attributes.

      <h3>Multiple Selection Editing</h3>
      <p>When a popup menu item is
      invoked from an item that is a member of a selection group,
      all of the edited values that were made in the popup are
      applied to all members of the selection group if that value
      is relevant to the member. For example, if the font size is
      changed on one of the items in the selection group then the
      font size is changed in all items in the group. If say, a
      fast clock were included in this group, then no change would
      be made to the clock.</p>
