<H1>The Control Panel Editor</H1>

Control Panel Editor is simply an alternative view and controller of <b>exactly the
same content data</b> as Panel Editor.  You may change the view and control of your 
panel whenever and as often as you please.  Storage and loading can be done from either
editor.  The editor used to store the panel will be the editor used at the next load.

<p><b><i>Note:
Control Panel Editor was developed and tested on Windows only.  The developer
would very much like to have this application work on other operating systems 
(e.g. Mac and Linux),
but is unable to test on these environments.  Any comments would be appreciated.
</i></b> 

<H2>Changing the View between Editors</H2>

In either editor when in edit mode the last item in the <b>File</b> menu is <b>Change 
view to "..."</b>. ("..."
being the other editor).  Selecting this item switches the view from one editor mode to 
the other editor mode.


<H2>Differences in the View between Editors</H2>

Panel Editor has a separate window for its editing functions. Control Panel Editor
does not.  Instead three new menus are introduced to the panel: <b>Options</b>, 
<b>Zoom</b>, <b>AddItems</b>.  When operating mode (non-edit) is selected these 
three menus disappear.


<H2>Control Panel Editor Menus</H2>
<H3>File Menu</H3>
The <b>File</b> menu changes it items between edit mode and operating mode.  In
edit mode the items are exactly the same as the items in the File menu of the
Panel Editor's edit window with one additional item, <b>Rename Panel</b>.  In
operating mode Control Panel Editor's File menu has only one item, <b>Open Editor</b>.

<H3>Options Menu</H3>
The items in this menu are similar to the checkboxes in Panel Editor's edit window with
a few additional items and features.
<p>The first item is <b>Close Editor</b>.  This changes Control Panel Editor's mode from
"edit" to "operating".</p>
<p>The next item, <b>Override individual Position & Control settings</b>, enables a feature
not found in Panel Editor.  When this item is selected, the next two items are enabled.
Selecting these item allow you to reposition all items in the panel or to have all items
with the capability of controlling the device they represent to control the device or not.
<p>Unchecking the <b>Override individual Position & Control settings</b> item will 
return the individual item settings to their previous settings.  This feature is not 
available in Panel Editor, where checking these options will permanently set all panel
item to those set by the Panel Editor.</p>
<p>Setting scroll bar preferences is also found in this menu.</p>

<H3>Zoom Menu</H3>
The <b>Zoom(percentage)...</b> item will enlarge or reduce the panel size.
<p>The <b>Zoom to Fit</b> item will enlarge or reduce the display of all panel items 
in the panel to fit
within the panel window without the use of scroll bars.  This can be useful if your panel
design happens to be slightly larger that what you can fit on the screen.  Rather than 
using scroll bars to see all items on the panel, "Zoom to Fit" will reduce the
display to fit the panel window.  Conversely, it will expand the display to fit the
panel window.  If you resize the panel window, then you should repeat "Zoom to Fit"
to resize the display to fit the new panel window dimensions. 

<H3>AddItems Menu</H3>
This menu will open a tabbed window which allows you to add items to the panel.  This
tabbed window, <b>Item Palette</b>, extends the functions found in the drop down 
ComboBox of the Panel Editor.  The methods for adding items done by drag and drop.
Details may be found at !!!ItemPaletteHelp - to do!!!. 

<H2>Mouse operation in Control Panel Editor</H2>
Control Panel Editor does not implement the rollover highlighting found in Panel Editor.
<p>Another difference is selection is done with a simple click. Right click (meta-click 
on Mac or Linux) brings up the popup menu for the item.</p>
<p>Dragging can be donw with either a simple click or a meta-click.</p>

<H3>Multiple Selection</H3>
As with Panel Editor, a selection group can be made using the "selection fence" -
a dotted red rectangle that will select all the items completely <b><i>within</i></b> the fence.  If
the <b>Shift</b> key is held down while creating a selection fence, then all items that
<b><i>intersect</i></b> the dotted red rectangle are selected.  This can be a useful feature when items are
located at the top and left borders of the panel.
<p>Another shared feature is adding or deleting items from a selection group by
holding the <b>Control</b> key dowm whhen slecting the item.</p>  
 
<H3>Dragging selections</H3>
Dragging a selection or selection group may be done with either mouse button in Control Panel Editor.
<p>A background icon (i.e. an icon at level 1) can be moved by dragging it with the control
key held down.</p>

<H2>Copy in Control Panel Editor</H2>
Copying an item or selection group is done by bringing up the popup for one of the
selected items.  When the <b>Copy</b> popup menu item is clicked, a Copy of the 
selection group is made on top of the original selections.  Drag this copy to whereever
you wish to place the copy.  The original selection is now deselected and remains
at its original postion.  The copy procedure can be repeated on the newly positioned
copy to continue to make more copies.

<H2>Item Popups in Control Panel Editor</H2>
Right click (meta-click 
on Mac or Linux) brings up the popup menu for the item.

<H3>Edit Text Attributes</H3>
The <b>Edit Text Attributes</b> popup item opens a dialog to set any of the 
item's text attributes.

<H3>Multiple Selection Editing</H3>
When a popup menu item is invoked from an item that is a member of a selection
group, all of the edited values that were made in the popup are applied to all
members of the selection group if that value is relevant to the member.  For 
example, if the font size is changed on one of the items in the selection
group then the font size is changed in all items in the group.  If say, a fast clock
were included in this group, then no change would be made to the clock.
