      <h1>Edit Track Segment</h1>

      <h2>Track Segments and Connecting Points</h2>A <b>Track
      Segment</b> is a piece of straight track stretching between
      two connection points. Connection points are drawn as small
      red or green squares. Connection points are found on
      turnouts, anchor points, end bumpers, and level crossings.
      Each turnout has three or four connection points, each
      accepting one connection. Each anchor point has one
      connection point that can accept two connections. An end
      bumper is similar, but only accepts one connection. Level
      crossings have four connection points, each accepting one
      connection. A connection point that can accept a connecting
      track segment is drawn red. When a connection point has its
      capacity of connections, its color is changed to green. When
      all connection points are green, a track diagram is complete,
      with all connections defined.

      <h2>Line Styles</h2>Track segments are normally drawn as
      solid lines. but you can designate that a track segment be
      drawn <i>dashed</i> to show tunnels or tracks crossing at
      different grades. You can request a dashed line for a track
      segment by checking <b>Dashed</b> in the tool bar before the
      track segment is created, or you can change a track segment
      to <b>Dashed</b> in the Edit Track Segment dialog. (More
      anchor points can be added to get the dashed part of your
      track to cover the exact area desired.) You can also
      designate a track segment as <i>hidden</i> so it's displayed
      only when edit mode is active. <i>Hidden</i> track segments
      are useful for track diagrams drawn as multiple rows where
      the end of one row connects to the beginning of the same or
      another row. To make a track segment hidden, check <b>Hide
      Track</b> in the Edit Track Segment dialog.

      <h2>Mainline Track and Side Track</h2>Optionally, track
      segments are used to designate <i>mainline track</i> or
      <i>side track</i>. The legs of turnouts and level crossings
      are set to <i>mainline track</i> or <i>side track</i>
      according to the designations of track segments that are
      connected to them. See the discussion of continuing routes in
      the above section on turnouts for information on how a
      mainline is tracked through a turnout.

      <p>If <b>Mainline</b> is checked in the tool bar when a track
      segment is created, that track segment is designated as
      <i>mainline track</i>, otherwise it is considered <i>side
      track</i>. You can change from mainline track to side track,
      or vice versa, in the Edit Track dialog. Mainline track and
      side track may be drawn with different width lines. Track
      widths for each are set using the <b>Set Track Width...</b>
      item in the Options menu.</p>

      <h2>Track Blocks</h2>Optionally, you can designate which
      <b>Block</b> a track segment is in--either by entering a
      block name in the <b>Block: Name</b> field of the tool bar
      prior to creating each track segment, or by entering a block
      name in the Edit Track Segment dialog at a later time. The
      Edit Track Segment dialog also allows an Edit Block dialog to
      be requested, so information for the track segment's block
      may be entered or changed. Blocks are discussed more fully in
      the help page of the Create/Edit Block dialog.
