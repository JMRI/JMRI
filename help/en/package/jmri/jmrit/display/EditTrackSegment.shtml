      <h1>Edit Track Segment</h1>

      <h2>Track Segments and Connecting Points</h2>
      A <strong>Track Segment</strong> is a piece of straight track stretching between two
      connection points. Connection points are drawn as small red or green squares. Connection
      points are found on turnouts, anchor points, end bumpers, and level crossings. Each turnout
      has three or four connection points, each accepting one connection. Each anchor point has one
      connection point that can accept two connections. An end bumper is similar, but only accepts
      one connection. Level crossings have four connection points, each accepting one connection. A
      connection point that can accept a connecting track segment is drawn red. When a connection
      point has its capacity of connections, its color is changed to green. When all connection
      points are green, a track diagram is complete, with all connections defined.
      <h2>Line Styles</h2>
      Track segments are normally drawn as solid lines. but you can designate that a track segment
      be drawn <em>dashed</em> to show tunnels or tracks crossing at different grades. You can
      request a dashed line for a track segment by checking <strong>Dashed</strong> in the tool bar
      before the track segment is created, or you can change a track segment to
      <strong>Dashed</strong> in the Edit Track Segment dialog. (More anchor points can be added to
      get the dashed part of your track to cover the exact area desired.) You can also designate a
      track segment as <em>hidden</em> so it's displayed only when edit mode is active.
      <em>Hidden</em> track segments are useful for track diagrams drawn as multiple rows where the
      end of one row connects to the beginning of the same or another row. To make a track segment
      hidden, check <strong>Hide Track</strong> in the Edit Track Segment dialog.
      <h2>Mainline Track and Side Track</h2>
      Optionally, track segments are used to designate <em>mainline track</em> or <em>side
      track</em>. The legs of turnouts and level crossings are set to <em>mainline track</em> or
      <em>side track</em> according to the designations of track segments that are connected to
      them. See the discussion of continuing routes in the above section on turnouts for
      information on how a mainline is tracked through a turnout.
      <p>If <strong>Mainline</strong> is checked in the tool bar when a track segment is created,
      that track segment is designated as <em>mainline track</em>, otherwise it is considered
      <em>side track</em>. You can change from mainline track to side track, or vice versa, in the
      Edit Track dialog. Mainline track and side track may be drawn with different width lines.
      Track widths for each are set using the <strong>Set Track Width...</strong> item in the
      Options menu.</p>

      <h2>Track Blocks</h2>
      Optionally, you can designate which <strong>Block</strong> a track segment is in--either by
      entering a block name in the <strong>Block: Name</strong> field of the tool bar prior to
      creating each track segment, or by entering a block name in the Edit Track Segment dialog at
      a later time. The Edit Track Segment dialog also allows an Edit Block dialog to be requested,
      so information for the track segment's block may be entered or changed. Blocks are discussed
      more fully in the help page of the Create/Edit Block dialog.
