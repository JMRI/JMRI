      <h1>Edit Level Crossing</h1>A level crossing is a special
      piece of track that represents two tracks crossing at grade.
      A level crossing is commonly referred to as a diamond. A
      level crossing has four connection points, and two tracks,
      designated 1 and 2. When a level crossing is created, track 1
      is the horizontal track, and track 2 is the inclined track.
      The angle between the two tracks, the incline of each track,
      and the length of each track may be varied by dragging
      connection points with the meta key pressed. The center of
      the level crossing may be positioned by dragging the center
      circle with the meta key pressed (see the help bar for which
      key is the meta key for your operating system).

      <p>Optionally each track will be either <i>mainline track</i>
      or <i>side track</i> depending on the mainline track or side
      track designation of track segments connected to each track.
      Also optionally you may independently assign each track to a
      different block. If a block name is entered in the <b>Block:
      Name</b> field of the tool bar prior to creating a level
      crossing, that block is assigned to both of the tracks. Each
      track may be assigned a different block in the Edit Level
      Crossing dialog. The Edit Level Crossing dialog also allows a
      Create/Edit Block dialog to be requested for each of the two
      blocks, so information for these blocks may be entered or
      changed. Blocks are discussed more fully on the help page of
      the Create/Edit Block dialog.</p>
