      <h1>Edit Level Crossing</h1>
      A level crossing is a special piece of track that represents two tracks crossing at grade. A
      level crossing is commonly referred to as a diamond. A level crossing has four connection
      points, and two tracks, designated 1 and 2. When a level crossing is created, track 1 is the
      horizontal track, and track 2 is the inclined track. The angle between the two tracks, the
      incline of each track, and the length of each track may be varied by dragging connection
      points with the meta key pressed. The center of the level crossing may be positioned by
      dragging the center circle with the meta key pressed (see the help bar for which key is the
      meta key for your operating system).
      <p>Optionally each track will be either <em>mainline track</em> or <em>side track</em>
      depending on the mainline track or side track designation of track segments connected to each
      track. Also optionally you may independently assign each track to a different block. If a
      block name is entered in the <strong>Block: Name</strong> field of the tool bar prior to
      creating a level crossing, that block is assigned to both of the tracks. Each track may be
      assigned a different block in the Edit Level Crossing dialog. The Edit Level Crossing dialog
      also allows a Create/Edit Block dialog to be requested for each of the two blocks, so
      information for these blocks may be entered or changed. Blocks are discussed more fully on
      the help page of the Create/Edit Block dialog.</p>
