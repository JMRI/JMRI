      <h1>Set Signals at A Single/Double Slip</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tool provides an automated procedure for assigning
      signals at Single or double slip.</p><a href=
      "./images/Slip.png"><img src="./images/Slip.png" width="229"
      height="104" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>

      <p>If requested, this tool will place signal icons on the
      panel at the four entrances, to the slip and will set up
      control logic for specified signal heads. Either one or two
      signal heads may be placed at each leg of the slip. The
      continuing leg is the direct path through the slip from
      either direction, while the diverging leg is the path that
      deviates from the direct path.</p>

      <p>Prior to selecting this tool, the slip must be on the
      panel with two turnouts assigned and configured correct for
      each path, the required signal heads must also be in the
      Signal Head Table. The control logic created by this tool
      only works correctly if each of the track segments connected
      to the slip legs is assigned to a different block. it works
      best if the track segment assigned to the slip is in a fifth
      different block, but this is not required.</p>

      <p>When this item is selected, a dialog is shown with a combo
      box to select the slip that is on the current panel and the
      names (system or user) of six to eight signal heads to be
      assigned to the two turnouts.</p>

      <p>For each signal head, check boxes are available for
      selecting whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and
      whether control logic is to be created for the signal head.
      Regardless of whether icons are placed or logic is created,
      Layout Editor will record that the entered signal heads are
      assigned to the slip.</p>

      <h3>The Set Signals at Slip Dialog</h3>

      <p>In the drop down list select the Slip that is located on
      the panel that you wish to configure, the name populated in
      the drop down box is made up of the turnout names used to
      create the slip. On selecting the slip, if signals have
      already been assigned then this information will
      automatically be populated.</p>

      <p>The tool provides for entry of one or two signals at each
      leg of the slip, depending upon the slip type and the leg
      selected.<br>
      These signal heads show the status for moving through the
      direct or sliped path through the slip. First the signal
      heads located at <b>Turnout 1 - continuing track</b> are
      entered. The <b>continuing track</b> signal head is required,
      but the <b>diverging track</b> entry is optional. If only the
      <b>continuing track</b> signal head is entered, the tool
      assumes that head is signaling both tracks of the other
      turnout, similar to when only one signal head is placed at
      the throat of a single turnout.</p>

      <p>Next the signal heads located at <b>Turnout 1 - diverging
      track</b> are entered. Remember this is for when the path
      through the slip is set to be slipped. When two heads are
      entered, the head closest to the slip signals the status of
      the direct path.<br>
      Similarly, the signal heads located at <b>Turnout 2 -
      continuing track</b> and <b>Turnout 2 - diverging track</b>
      are entered.</p>

      <p>If there was a signal head previously assigned to any
      position, and you enter a <i>different</i> signal head in the
      same place, the new signal head will replace the previous
      signal head, and the icon of the previous signal head (if
      there was one) will be deleted from the panel. Similarly, if
      you replace a previously assigned <b>Diverging</b> signal
      head with a blank entry (no signal head), the previous entry
      is deleted, and there will not be any signal head at that
      position. <b>If a signal head is changed, you must redo any
      logic that involves it.</b> In particular, if you delete a
      diverging signal head, you must redo the logic for the
      continuing signal head located on the same track.</p>

      <p>Check <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> to request that an
      icon for a signal head be placed on the panel at the turnout
      position indicated.</p>

      <p>Check <b>Set up Logic</b> to request that the tool set up
      signal control logic for a signal head. For each of these
      signal heads, the tool creates a Simple Signal Logic for that
      head, and in addition creates a Logix that ensures that the
      turnout the signal is placed on is not thrown against the leg
      the signal is placed on. The tool will attempt to setup the
      logic and automatically fill in entries from the information
      available. If the tool does not have enough information
      available to set up the logic, a message results, and you
      will have to return later after more blocks (with occupancy
      sensors) and/or signals have been assigned to turnouts and
      block boundaries on the panel.</p>

      <h3>Notes</h3>

      <p>The tool will set up the Simple Signal Logic to set all
      signals red if the slip is occupied. If this is not what you
      want, you should edit the Simple Signal Logic by removing the
      occupancy sensor of that block.</p>

      <p>When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within
      a block until it finds a signal at the end of the block away
      from the turnout being signaled. If your layout contains
      sections that are signaled and sections that are not, to get
      this tool to set up logic correctly, you may have to create
      and assign a virtual signal (a signal that does not
      correspond to an actual signal on the layout) at the
      unsignaled end of the block that connects track that is
      signaled with track that is not signaled. (You do not need to
      add an icon for the virtual signal to your panel, but it must
      exist in your signal head table, and must be assigned to a
      turnout or block boundary using a Set Signals ... tool.) If a
      block ends with an end bumper, no virtual signal is required
      at the end bumper end.</p>

      <p>If a block has an internal turnout (the turnout, and the
      track segments at its throat and continuing legs are within
      the block), the program will expect signals at that turnout
      even if it's not at the end of the block. However, at times
      the user may not want to signal a seldom used turnout within
      a block. When following track through a block, the program
      will skip over unsignaled internal turnouts if <b>Skip
      Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</b> is checked in the Layout
      Editor <b>Tools</b> menu. It will always, however, warn that
      it is doing so. <b>Use this option with caution.</b> There is
      no signal protecting against a skipped turnout being set
      incorrectly, so if an unsignaled internal turnout is not set
      correctly, derailed trains could result.</p>

      <p>When setting up the Logix used in the control logic, the
      tool creates an internal sensor to communicate with the
      Simple Signal Logic. The Logix will appear in your Logix
      table, and the internal sensor will appear in your sensor
      table. The system names of the Logix and internal sensor will
      be, IX or IS followed by TTT_HHH, where TTT is the system
      name of the turnout where the signal head is located and HHH
      is the system name of the signal head. The purpose of this
      Logix is to ensure that the aspect of the signal head will be
      red if the turnout where the signal head is located is
      switched against the track the signal is on.</p>

      <p>This tool sets up three-aspect signaling. When a signal
      head is showing the status when moving to a diverging route,
      the tool will set up for limited speed (the least restrictive
      aspect is not green, but yellow), and the signal will show
      yellow when it otherwise would show green. You can change
      this with a simple edit (see below).</p>

      <p>If you have a special situation at a signal, you may have
      to edit the information entered by this tool into the Simple
      Signal Logic. If you would like four-aspect signaling, you
      can easily manually edit the logic to achieve this.
      Similarly, by simple hand edits of the logic, you can add
      approach lighting. If you don't want yellow when moving to
      the diverging route, but prefer green, open the Simple Signal
      Logic for the head you want to change and uncheck <b>Limited
      Speed</b>. The Simple Signal Logic dialog can be accessed
      from the popup menu of each signal icon. If your special
      situation cannot be handled by Simple Signal Logic, you
      should refer to Logix to tailor the signal logic to your
      needs.</p>

      <p><b>Please remember to save your panel after using this
      tool.</b></p>
