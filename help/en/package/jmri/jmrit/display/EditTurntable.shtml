      <h1>Edit Turntable</h1>A Layout Editor turntable is a
      schematic representation of a turntable on the layout. A
      turntable is drawn as a circle with a variable number of
      track connections, called <i>ray tracks</i>. Each <i>ray
      track</i> is drawn as a short stub track radiating from the
      turntable circle. A track segment should connect to each ray
      track. Most of these track segments will connect a ray track
      to an end bumper. The distance of each ray track connection
      point from the turntable circle is fixed, but the direction
      of each ray track may be varied by dragging its connection
      point around the turntable circle. Any number of turntables
      may be added to a panel, and each turntable may have any
      number of ray tracks.

      <p>A turntable is added to a panel by selecting <b>Add
      Turntable</b> in the panel's Option menu. New turntables are
      placed at the center of the panel, and should be moved to
      desired locations by dragging its center point with the meta
      key pressed (right button drag on Windows). When a turntable
      is added, it has four ray tracks located in up, down, left,
      and right directions. The turntable's popup menu has two
      items. Selecting <b>Edit...</b> brings up an Edit Turntable
      dialog, and selecting <b>Remove</b> deletes the turntable and
      any track segments connected to it. Before a turntable is
      actually deleted, the program asks for verification of that
      action.</p>

      <p><img src="images/EditTurntable.png" align="right"> The
      Edit Turntable dialog allows the following</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Radius of the turntable circle to be changed</li>

        <li>New Rays to be added</li>

        <li>Angles of Ray to be altered</li>

        <li>Rays to be removed</li>

        <li>Automation to be configured</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ray track angles are measured from the vertical in a
      clockwise direction. So, thinking of an analog clock, an
      angle of 0 degrees is exactly vertical (the 12 o'clock
      position). Similarly an angle of 90 degrees corresponds to
      the 3 o'clock position, 180 degrees to 6 o'clock, 270 degrees
      to 9 o'clock, and so on. Angles are always entered in
      degrees.</p>

      <p>To add a ray track, enter the angle corresponding to it's
      desired position in <b>Ray Track Angle</b>, and click <b>New
      Ray Track</b>. The turntable shows the new ray track
      immediately. To delete a ray track, find it in the connection
      list and press <b>Remove</b>. The ray track, and any
      connected track segment are immediately deleted from the
      panel. <b>Caution: There is no undo for these
      operations.</b></p>

      <p><b>DCC Controlled Turntable</b><br>
      When this is selected it allows for control of turntables
      (and drivers) that use DCC turnout addresses to set the
      turntable to various positions. Such examples are the LDT
      TT-DEC or Heljan DCC Turntable. For each Ray, select or
      create the DCC turnout address and the position required to
      set it.<br>
      To set the turntable to the desired position, simply click on
      the ray that you wish the turntable to be aligned with.</p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> An easy procedure is possible for accurately
      aligning ray track connection points and end bumpers so that
      each track segment extends through the center of the
      turntable. After positioning the center of the turntable, and
      after adding ray tracks where needed, expand the radius of
      the turntable by a factor of three to four. Then add end
      bumpers adjacent to (or on top of) each ray track connection
      point. After shrinking the radius back to its final radius,
      add track segments. Track segments will be aligned fairly
      precisely to the turntable center.</p>
