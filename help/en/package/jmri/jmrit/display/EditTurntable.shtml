      <h1>Edit Turntable</h1>
      A Layout Editor turntable is a schematic representation of a turntable on the layout. A
      turntable is drawn as a circle with a variable number of track connections, called <em>ray
      tracks</em>. Each <em>ray track</em> is drawn as a short stub track radiating from the
      turntable circle. A track segment should connect to each ray track. Most of these track
      segments will connect a ray track to an end bumper. The distance of each ray track connection
      point from the turntable circle is fixed, but the direction of each ray track may be varied
      by dragging its connection point around the turntable circle. Any number of turntables may be
      added to a panel, and each turntable may have any number of ray tracks.
      <p>A turntable is added to a panel by selecting <strong>Add Turntable</strong> in the panel's
      Option menu. New turntables are placed at the center of the panel, and should be moved to
      desired locations by dragging its center point with the meta key pressed (right button drag
      on Windows). When a turntable is added, it has four ray tracks located in up, down, left, and
      right directions. The turntable's popup menu has two items. Selecting
      <strong>Edit...</strong> brings up an Edit Turntable dialog, and selecting
      <strong>Remove</strong> deletes the turntable and any track segments connected to it. Before
      a turntable is actually deleted, the program asks for verification of that action.</p>

      <p><img src="images/EditTurntable.png" class="floatRight" alt="turnout dialog"> The Edit
      Turntable dialog allows the following</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Radius of the turntable circle to be changed</li>

        <li>New Rays to be added</li>

        <li>Angles of Ray to be altered</li>

        <li>Rays to be removed</li>

        <li>Automation to be configured</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ray track angles are measured from the vertical in a clockwise direction. So, thinking of
      an analog clock, an angle of 0 degrees is exactly vertical (the 12 o'clock position).
      Similarly an angle of 90 degrees corresponds to the 3 o'clock position, 180 degrees to 6
      o'clock, 270 degrees to 9 o'clock, and so on. Angles are always entered in degrees.</p>

      <p>To add a ray track, enter the angle corresponding to it's desired position in <strong>Ray
      Track Angle</strong>, and click <strong>New Ray Track</strong>. The turntable shows the new
      ray track immediately. To delete a ray track, find it in the connection list and press
      <strong>Remove</strong>. The ray track, and any connected track segment are immediately
      deleted from the panel. <strong>Caution: There is no undo for these operations.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>DCC Controlled Turntable</strong><br>
      When this is selected it allows for control of turntables (and drivers) that use DCC turnout
      addresses to set the turntable to various positions. Such examples are the LDT TT-DEC or
      Heljan DCC Turntable. For each Ray, select or create the DCC turnout address and the position
      required to set it.<br>
      To set the turntable to the desired position, simply click on the ray that you wish the
      turntable to be aligned with.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> An easy procedure is possible for accurately aligning ray track
      connection points and end bumpers so that each track segment extends through the center of
      the turntable. After positioning the center of the turntable, and after adding ray tracks
      where needed, expand the radius of the turntable by a factor of three to four. Then add end
      bumpers adjacent to (or on top of) each ray track connection point. After shrinking the
      radius back to its final radius, add track segments. Track segments will be aligned fairly
      precisely to the turntable center.</p>
