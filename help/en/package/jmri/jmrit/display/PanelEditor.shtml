      <h1>The Panel Editor</h1>

      <p><img src="images/PanelEditor.png" align="right"><br>
      A Panel is a set of Icons representing various components of
      a layout. Some of the Icons available in JMRI include
      Turnouts, Signals Masts and Sensors. You can include a
      background icon to display your layout on your Panel and add
      the contents of Memory and/or Reporter Variables.</p>

      <p>The controls on the Panel itself are described on a
      <a href="PanelTarget.shtml">separate Panel Help page</a>.</p>

      <p>Panels created with the Panel Editor allow you to place
      images to represent Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads, Signal
      Masts, trackwork, etc.</p>

      <p>If you'd like to see animated clinics that show how each
      of these things are actually done on the computer screen,
      please see <a href=
      "http://www.rr-cirkits.com/Clinics/Clinics.html">Dick
      Bronson's clinics page</a>.</p>

      <h2>Contents of the Panel Editor</h2>

      <p>The Panel Editor consists of the following items:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Two text fields, <b>x:</b> and <b>y:</b>, specifying
        where (in pixels) new components will be inserted on the
        panel. You can generally ignore these, as once the
        components has been inserted you can drag it around by
        holding the meta (Apple, command; Linux &amp; Windows,
        right button) key down.</li>

        <li>A button to set the title of the Panel you are editing.
        Press the button and you will be prompted to enter the
        text.</li>

        <li>A button to add a text label. Put the desired text in
        the field and click the button. You can slide the label
        around after inserting it, but you currently can't edit the
        text later.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none"><img src="images/PanelEditor2.png"
        align="right"></li>

        <li>A dropdown menu where you may choose the type of icon
        or data you may put into the panel.

          <ul>
            <li>Add Right Hand Turnout Icon</li>

            <li>Add Left Hand Turnout Icon</li>

            <li>Add Sensor Icon</li>

            <li>Add Signal Head Icon</li>

            <li>Add Signal Mast Icon</li>

            <li>Add Memory Value</li>

            <li>Add Reporter Value</li>

            <li>Add Background Image</li>

            <li>Add MultiSensor (i.e levers and switches)
            Icons</li>

            <li>Add RPS Reporter Icon</li>

            <li>Add Fast Clock</li>

            <li>Add Icon (unassociated to any JMRI device)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In most cases, selecting one of these items will
          open a window from which icons or values can be chosen.
          For the items referring to a JMRI device (e.g. turnout,
          sensor, etc.) a pick list of the available devices is
          displayed. From there you select the device and the icon
          to represent it in the panel. Exceptions to this are the
          Memory and Reporter items where the selection puts the
          value of item into the panel. The Background item
          provides images for the background of the panel. Further
          details on using these windows are described on the
          <a href="IconAdder.shtml">Icon Editors page</a>.</p>

          <p>The two choices for icons that do not open windows are
          RPS Reporter and Fast Clock. These items install their
          icons directly into the panel.</p>
        </li>

        <li>A checkbox for making popup menus active. When checked
        a small popup menu will appear when you right click an
        icon. Most icons allow you to rotate and remove the icon.
        There are other options depending on the type of icon, for
        example, you can disable a turnout so it doesn't actually
        control anything.

          <p>The popup menu may also change if the configuration of
          an item is changed. For example, if you add feedback to a
          turnout, the popup menu includes a new item choice called
          "Tristate". Tristate allows you to use the inconsistent
          icon, which is one of the four possible icons available
          for a turnout. Normally when you first click on a turnout
          icon it commands the layout to change the state of the
          turnout. If you use feedback for a particular turnout,
          the icon display will wait to hear from the layout before
          modifying the turnout icon to the closed or thrown icon.
          By using Tristate, the icon will change immediately to
          the inconsistent icon when the turnout is clicked.
          Inconsistent in this case means that I've commanded the
          turnout to change and now we're waiting to hear if it
          actually happened. If and when the layout returns the
          actual or "known state" of the turnout, the icon will
          change to that state. If you don't use Tristate, when you
          click on the icon, it may take some time (milliseconds to
          seconds depending on the system) before the icon responds
          with the known state of the turnout.</p>
        </li>

        <li>All panel items can be repositioned. When checked you
        can move items in your panel by selecting and dragging them
        with the meta key. Linux and Windows users can hold the
        right click down and drag. By default new items can be
        repositioned even if this box isn't checked.</li>

        <li>Show item's coordinates in popup menu. When checked,
        the item's popup menu will include the item's X and Y
        coordinates. This can help you better position your icons
        in the panel.</li>

        <li>Panel items control layout. Normally you want to
        control your layout, so leave this box checked. Otherwise,
        uncheck the box if you don't want your panel to send
        commands to your layout.</li>

        <li>Panel has menu. Once you don't need to change or edit
        your layout, you can disable the ability to use the panel
        editor. The only way to re-enable the editor is to edit the
        panel file. Using a simple editor (Notepad for Window users
        will work) or XML editor, open your panel and find
        panelmenu="no" and change "no" to "yes" and save the file.
        The panel will now show the menu the next time you load the
        panel in PanelPro.</li>

        <li>Panel scrollbars. (JMRI 2.5.2 and later). Allows you to
        choose which scrollbars to display.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>After Creating A Panel</h2>

      <p>After getting the panel the way you want, you need to use
      the "Store panels..." entry in the "Panels" menu to write it
      to an XML file.</p>

      <h3>Available Icons</h3>The JMRI library contains lots of
      contributed icons for representing CTC panels, LEDs, etc. You
      can browse through them using the file tree in the Change
      Icon frame.

      <p>Each of the Icon Editor windows has a <b>Find Icons</b>
      Menu that provides several ways to find and acquire
      additional icons to place into your panel. See the <a href=
      "IconAdder.shtml">Icon Editors page</a> for more details.</p>

      <h2>Other types of panels</h2>

      <p>Because this is icon-based, you can create panels that
      look any way you want. For example, instead of using
      track-schematic icons for turnouts, you could use small
      images of the levers and plates on CTC machine. This would
      give you "mechanical" levers you can flip back and forth with
      a click.</p>

      <p>It's also possible to create a panel where the "track"
      lines change color to indicate whether the track is occupied.
      The procedure for doing that is described on a <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/apps/PanelPro/ColorTrack.html">separate
      page</a>.</p>

      <h2>Manipulating Icons</h2>

      <p>To move an icon around on the panel, you "meta-drag" it.
      On a Mac, that's "hold the cmd key and drag with the cursor";
      on Linux or Windows, "hold the right mouse click and drag
      with the cursor".</p>

      <p>There's also a pop-up menu (ctrl-click on a Mac;
      right-click on Linux or Windows) that will provide various
      ways to manipulate the icon. It will let you rotate the icon
      so that it points in whatever direction you want. Text labels
      can have their font, size and color changed. You can also
      remove icons from the panel with the popup menu.</p>

      <h3>Rotating and Scaling</h3>

      <p>When the checkbox for showing an icon's coordinates is
      checked, the icon can be scaled or rotated an arbitrary
      number of degrees. When this checkbox is checked, two
      additional items appear in the icon's popup menu - <b>Rotate
      (degrees)...</b> and <b>Scale (percentage)...</b>. When these
      item are selected, a text box will appear near the icon and
      ask for a number. In the case of 'Rotate (degrees)', a
      positive or negative integer will rotate the icon that number
      of degrees. In the case of 'Scale (percentage)', a positive
      number is the percentage to increase or decrease the size of
      the icon.</p>

      <p>The <b>Rotate (Orthogonal)</b> item rotates the icon 90
      degrees each time it is selected. Choosing an alternative
      rotation item resets the former rotation to the default icon
      image. For example, if the icon has been scaled to 75% and
      set to 30 degrees and then 'Rotate (Orthogonal)' is selected,
      the icon will return to its original size and
      orientation.</p>

      <h3>Group Moving and Aligning</h3>

      <p>When the checkbox for repositioning icons is checked,
      groups of icons can be selected. Pressing the mouse button
      down in an open area and dragging will draw a dotted red
      rectangle. All the icons that lie within this "fence" are
      items that are selected. Those icons within the "fence" that
      do <b>not</b> have the <b>fixed</b> or <b>Lock Position</b>
      checkbox marked in their popup menus can be moved as a group.
      Dragging any one of the repositionable icons within the fence
      will move the entire group. Clicking in an open area will
      remove the "fence" and ungroup the icons.</p>

      <p>In addition, grouped icons can be aligned horizontally and
      vertically. When grouped, the icons have two additional menu
      items in their popup menus: <b>Align Vertically</b> and
      <b>Align Horizontally</b>. Once again, the grouped icons that
      are not fixed or locked can be aligned with either their left
      edges (x coordinate) equal, or top edges (y coordinate)
      equal. These menu items disappear when the icons are
      ungrouped.</p>

      <p>Another feature of grouped icons is they can be locked
      (fixed) and unlocked (unfixed) as a group when any one of the
      group's popup menu item for lock or fix is checked.</p>

      <p>When placing icons on top of one another, the upper icon
      may prevent moving the icon underneath. For example when
      labeling a turnout, you may not be able to reposition the
      label without dragging the turnout above it. However, if you
      press the Shift key before dragging the label the turnout
      will remain in place while you reposition the label. That is
      a "Shift-Drag" leaves the top icon in place and only moves
      the icons beneath it.</p>

      <h3>Multi Slice Backgrounds</h3>

      <p>For users that need to build a classic US&amp;S panel
      there are several options. The first is to simply select the
      15 position panel background from
      icons/USS/background/uss-15.gif. Another option is to use a
      pixel based image editor to create your own background image.
      Save the image as a .gif or similar file. (see info above on
      where to store new images) Yet another option is to create
      the background image from multiple slices of the whole panel.
      JMRI supports using multiple background images so, by simply
      positioning each image properly, a complete panel of any
      reasonable size may be created.</p>

      <p>Currently there are two sets of image 'slices' available.
      One set is 718 pixels high, and the second set is 900 pixels
      high. Choose the set that best fits your display. These
      'slices' are located at icons/USS/background/. The 900 pixel
      high images include a "-9" in their names. The left and right
      edge images are each 12 pixels wide. The main panel 'slices'
      are 65 pixels wide. This allows you to precisely position
      each slice simply by changing the x: and y: coordinates in
      the Panel Editor. The advantages of building backgrounds with
      slices are that you can make virtually any length of panel
      that is required, and the plates will be precisely located
      automatically.</p>

      <p>First set the coordinates to x:0, y:0 and select
      icons/USS/background/Panel-left.gif. (or
      icons/USS/background/Panel-left-9.gif) This gives you the
      left edge of the panel. Change the coordinates to x:12 y:0
      and choose the next slice. It may be blank, include a switch
      plate, include a signal plate, or include both plates. Only
      the "x:" coordinate needs to be changed as you continue to
      add additional panel sections. The 'slices' are each 65
      pixels wide, so simply add 65 to the x: value for each
      additional slice. For example; to build up a 15 position
      panel from slices, use x:0 for the left side, then x:12,
      x:77, x:142, x:207, x:272, x:337, x:402, x:467, x:532, x:597,
      x:662, x:727, x:792, x:857, and x:922 for the individual
      slices. Finally set x:987 and complete the panel with
      icons/USS/background/Panel-right.gif.</p>

      <p>To change the style of any individual slice (e.g. to add a
      new plate to your panel) first check the "Show item's
      coordinates in popup menu" check box in the editor window.
      Next, right click in a blank area of the old slice to raise
      the pop up information including the coordinates of that
      slice. Put those numbers in the editor's coordinates, then
      remove the slice. Finally, choose a new slice and it will
      appear where the old one was.</p>

      <h2>Communicating with Multiple Systems</h2>

      <p>PanelPro can communicate with more than one layout
      hardware system. To configure JMRI&reg; to talk to multiple
      systems, select them in the Preferences panel (Edit -&gt;
      Preferences &gt; Connections (tab at left) -&gt; click on the
      + tab to add the system information for your second System
      Connection.</p>

      <p>If you add a Turnout, Sensor or Signal Mast to a Panel
      using just a number, e.g. "23", it will be assigned to the
      Default System as defined on the Preferences panel -&gt;
      Defaults tab. To access the second system, you have to use
      JMRI <a href=
      "../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">System
      Names</a>. For example, if the second attachment is to a
      LocoNet system, you'd refer to a LocoNet Turnout as LT13; a
      LocoNet Sensor as LS21, etc.</p>
