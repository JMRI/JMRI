      <h1>Edit Layout Slip</h1>
      A Slip is a special piece of track that represents two tracks crossing at grade, with the
      ability to switch between the tracks. It can come in two forms as a Single or a Double Slip.
      The slip has four connection points, and two tracks, designated 1 and 2. When a level
      crossing is created, track 1 is the horizontal track, and track 2 is the inclined track. The
      angle between the two tracks, the incline of each track, and the length of each track may be
      varied by dragging connection points with the meta key pressed. The center of the level
      crossing may be positioned by dragging the center circle with the meta key pressed (see the
      help bar for which key is the meta key for your operating system).
      <p>Although the slip is made up of two tracks it is treated as a single block and can be
      either a <em>mainline track</em> or <em>side track</em> depending on the mainline track or
      side track designation of track segment connected to each track. If a block name is entered
      in the <strong>Block: Name</strong> field of the tool bar prior to creating a slip, that
      block is assigned to the slip.</p>

      <p>The edit Slip window, allows you to configure the output states for the two turnouts that
      drive the slip and test these prior to confirming the configuration.</p>
