      <h1>Create/Edit Block</h1>Blocks are sections of track whose
      occupancy may be individually monitored. Dividing track into
      blocks is optional. Blocks set up in a track diagram normally
      correspond to physical blocks on a layout. Block occupancy is
      indicated by the state of an <i>occupancy sensor</i>. When a
      layout's track is divided into blocks, all of the track need
      not belong to a block. For example, yard track is normally
      not in a block, whereas mainline track almost always would be
      divided into blocks. The main use of blocks is to facilitate
      signaling, but blocks may be used for other layout control
      and animation functions.

      <p>If a block name is entered in the <b>Block: Name</b> field
      of the tool bar prior to adding a turnout, level crossing, or
      track segment, the added item is assigned to that block; if a
      sensor name (system name or user name) was entered into the
      <b>Occupancy Sensor</b> field, that sensor will be assigned
      to the entered block. A turnout, level crossing, or track
      segment may also be assigned to a block by entering that
      block's name in the edit dialog accessed by selecting
      <b>Edit...</b> in that items popup menu. In either case, if a
      block with the entered name doesn't exist, one is
      created.</p>

      <p>A block name may be any series of alphabetic or numeric
      characters that describe the block, for example, "Red Main
      2", "Lake Siding", or "Moose Block". Once a block is created,
      its name may not be changed; attempting to change a block's
      name will create a new block having the new name. After all
      items assigned to the old block are changed to the new block,
      the block with the old name will be automatically deleted
      (see below).</p>

      <p>Blocks may be viewed in the <b>Block Table</b>, that may
      be accessed using the <b>Tools</b> menu. Block information
      for a Layout Editor panel is kept in two parts, which are
      always linked together automatically. For each block, Layout
      Editor specific information is stored and managed in a Layout
      Editor specific part, and the generic part of the block
      information is stored in a JMRI Block. When a Layout Editor
      block is created, a corresponding JMRI Block is automatically
      created. The automatically created Block will have a system
      name <i>IBnnn</i> (where <i>nnn</i> is a number), and a user
      name the same as the block name mentioned above. It is the
      generic Blocks that are displayed in the Block Table. Avoid
      changing the user name in the Block Table, because this will
      break the link between the two parts of the block
      information.</p>

      <p>Of interest in the Block Table is the "Value" column. The
      "Value" can be used to identify trains as they move around
      the layout. If a train is parked in a Block, and train
      identifying text is manually entered into the "Value" entry
      for that Block, the text will be propagated from Block to
      Block as the train is run around the layout. When the train
      enters a Block, the text "Value" of the block the train
      entered from will be copied into the "Value" of the entered
      Block; when the train exits a Block, the "Value" of the now
      empty block will be cleared. If a Memory Variable is assigned
      to the block (see below), the "Value" of the Memory Variable
      will be set to the "Value" of the block. So by placing a
      Memory Icon near the block, the identity of the train in the
      block can be displayed in the Layout Editor panel.
      <b>Caution: Tracking trains using this method requires
      smoothly running block detection circuitry.</b> False or
      flickering block detection can easily confuse things.</p>

      <p>Turnout, level crossing, and track segment edit dialogs
      provide access to the Create/Edit Block dialog where
      information specific to a block may be entered or edited. The
      <b>Occupancy Sensor:</b> field in the Create/Edit Block
      dialog shows the name of the occupancy sensor currently
      assigned to the block, if there is one. To enter or change
      the occupancy sensor, enter the name (system name or user
      name) of a sensor in the Sensor Table in the <b>Occupancy
      Sensor:</b> field. A sensor may be assigned as the occupancy
      sensor of only one block; attempting to do otherwise will
      result in an error message. Normally, the state of an
      occupancy sensor is "Active" when a block is occupied, so
      "Active" for occupied sense is the automatic default. This
      can be changed by selecting "Inactive" in the <b>Occupied
      Sense:</b> selection box.</p>You can edit the sensor debounce
      options from this window, setting the Sensor Debounce helps
      to prevent false triggers of a sensor being passed into the
      system and triggering other events in the system.<br>
      Such false triggers could be due to a dirty piece of track or
      electrical interference. <b>Use Global Debounce Values</b>
      check box, allows you to select if the sensor will use the
      default sensor debounce values if configured.<br>
      <b>Inactive Delay</b> and <b>Active
      Delay</b> allow you to specify the amount of time in
      milliSeconds that the system waits before registering the
      state change of a sensor.

      <p>Block track colors are used instead of the default track
      color if a section of track is in a block. The track items in
      a block are drawn with different track colors for occupied
      and unoccupied states, allowing the track in a block to
      change color as a train enters and leaves that block. To set
      track colors, select the unoccupied track color in the
      <b>Track Color:</b> selection box, and select the occupied
      track color in the <b>Occupied Track Color:</b> selection
      box. An alternate unoccupied track color is provided for
      special uses. For example, Dispatcher has an option to use
      the alternate unoccupied track color for blocks that are
      allocated but unoccupied. Set the alternate unoccupied track
      color using the <b>Alternate Track Color:</b> selection box.
      When track color is set, Layout Editor will use the occupied
      track color if a block is occupied, then if not occupied,
      will use the alternate unoccupied track color if it has been
      requested, otherwise it uses the unoccupied track color.</p>

      <p>The <b>Memory Variable Name:</b> field in the Create/Edit
      Block dialog shows the name of the memory variable currently
      assigned to the block, if there is one. To enter or change
      the memory variable, enter the name (system name or user
      name) of a memory variable in the Memory Table in the
      <b>Memory Variable Name:</b> field. Assigning a memory
      variable is optional. An assigned memory variable will
      contain as its "value" the "value" of the Block, and is
      useful in identifying trains as they are tracked around the
      layout (see above).</p>

      <p>The <b>Permissive Working Allowed</b> check box allows the
      block to be set so that if it is already occupied, then
      another train is allowed to enter that block. This feature is
      mainly used within the SignalMast logic.</p>

      <p>If layout block routing has been enabled for use with the
      Signalmast Logic additional fields will be presented.</p>

      <p>The <b>Block Metric</b> assigns a cost against a
      particular block so it is possible to determine if the signal
      logic should use this block over another block if there are
      multiple paths. The lower the metric the more preferred it
      is. By default Main Line blocks have a value of 50, while a
      Side Track has a value of 200</p>

      <p>The <b>Attached Block</b> fields represent each block that
      is connected to this one, here you can determine if a route
      to a next block can be used both ways or only in one
      direction in working out the signaling logic. The options
      are.<br>
      <b>Bi-Directional</b> traffic can flow freely between each
      block.<br>
      <b>Send Only</b> is where this block can only be used to send
      traffic to the neighboring block, the neighboring block can
      not send traffic to us.<br>
      <b>Receive Only</b>, this block can only receive traffic from
      the adjacent block we can not send traffic to it.<br>
      So for example you might have a passing loop on a single
      section of line, you can use this so that trains always use
      the left hand path.</p>

      <p>Since blocks are items on the physical layout, the same
      block may be used in more than one panel. Consequently, block
      information is saved in the non- panel specific portion of
      the layout information, when panels are saved to a file on
      disk.</p>

      <p>Blocks are deleted automatically when they are no longer
      used. Layout Editor keeps track of the number of track items
      (turnouts, track segments, and level crossings) that are
      assigned to a block. This count is displayed in the
      Create/Edit Block dialog as <b>Current Use Count:</b>. When
      panels are saved to disk, only those blocks with a use count
      greater than zero are saved.</p>
