      <h1>Set Signals at Crossover</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tool provides an automated procedure for assigning signals to a crossover turnout,
      either a double crossover, a right-handed single crossover, or a left-handed single
      crossover. If requested, this tool will place signal icons on the panel at the specified
      turnout, and will set up signal logic for specified signal heads. Prior to selecting this
      tool, the turnout must be on the panel, and required signal heads must be in the Signal Head
      Table. This tool places signal heads only when the main track of the turnout is vertical or
      horizontal (or mostly vertical or horizontal) on the panel, so design your panel accordingly.
      The Simple Signal Logic created by this tool only works correctly if each of the track
      segments connected to the four connection points of the crossover are assigned to different
      blocks.</p>

      <p>When this item is selected in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, a small dialog is shown for
      entry of the turnout name (system or user) of a crossover turnout. If this tool is entered by
      selecting <strong>Set Signals...</strong> in the crossover turnout's popup menu, the turnout
      name is automatically entered. After the crossover turnout name has been entered and
      verified, a dialog is shown for entry of the names (system or user) of four to eight signal
      heads to be assigned to the crossover turnout.</p>

      <p>Crossover turnouts differ from other turnouts in several important ways. Like other
      turnouts, crossovers have two states--crossed (Thrown) and straight (Closed). To change a
      crossover's state, however, requires two or four track switches to change in unison. This may
      be accomplished using one to four switch machines. Normally a crossover is assigned a single
      turnout entry in the turnout table, but it may have several if its switch machines are
      controlled by different stationary decoders. You can use two JMRI routes controlled by the
      same internal turnout to make multiple switch machines work together. In this case, enter the
      internal turnout as the turnout linked to the crossover turnout drawing.</p>

      <p>For each signal head, check boxes are available for selecting whether an icon is to be
      placed on the panel, and whether Simple Signal Logic is to be created for the signal head.
      Regardless of whether icons are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record that
      the entered signal heads are assigned to the specified crossover turnout.</p>

      <p><strong>Assigning signal heads to turnouts is important to completely describe your layout
      in Layout Editor.</strong> Even if you elect to place your icons and set up your signal logic
      manually, you should use this tool to assign the signal heads to their crossover turnout.</p>

      <h2>The Set Signals at Crossover Dialog</h2>

      <p>If prompted to enter the <strong>Turnout Name</strong>, enter the name (system or user) of
      the crossover turnout to which the signal heads will be assigned. If the tool cannot find the
      entered turnout on the panel, an error message results. Also if the entered turnout is not a
      crossover turnout, an error message results. If an internal turnout is used to control the
      crossover (see above), enter its name in the <strong>Turnout Name</strong> field.</p>

      <p>Signal Head names (either system or user) are entered in the large dialog. Entry of two
      signals at each corner of the double crossover turnout is provided for. For left-handed
      crossovers or right-handed crossovers, the tool provides for two signals at each throat
      corner, and one signal at each continuing track corner. At least one
      <strong>Continuing</strong> signal head must be entered at each corner, but the
      <strong>Diverging</strong> entries are optional. The corner labels, A, B, C, and D are as
      shown below for the double crossover case of all eight signal heads and the double crossover
      turnout in the straight through (Closed) position. (In the diagram below, the double
      crossover turnout has not been rotated.)</p>

      height="109" alt="crossover double heads"></a>
      </p>

      <p>Similarly, the diagram below shows the four-signal-head case with a double crossover
      turnout in the crossover (Thrown) position. If you rotate the turnout, the corner labels
      rotate also. Single crossovers are the same, except with one crossover track instead of
      two.</p>

      </p>

      <p>If signal heads at this crossover turnout have been entered previously, click <strong>Get
      Saved</strong> to retrieve the signal head names previously entered.</p>

      <p>Any of the corners that can have two signals, may actually have either one or two signals,
      so all cases in between the two illustrated above are possible. Single crossovers may have 4,
      5, or 6 signal heads, and double crossovers may have 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 signal heads. If a
      signal head is entered for <strong>Diverging</strong>, then the <strong>Continuing</strong>
      head signals the straight through track and the <strong>Diverging</strong> head signals the
      crossover track. If no signal head is entered for <strong>Diverging</strong>, the
      <strong>Continuing</strong> signal head reflects the state of whichever track the turnout is
      switched to. In that case, the Simple Signal Logic type for the <strong>Continuing</strong>
      signal head is <strong>On Facing-Point Turnout</strong>.</p>

      <p>If there was a signal head previously assigned to any position, and you enter a
      <em>different</em> signal head in the same place, the new signal head will replace the
      previous signal head, and the icon of the previous signal head (if there was one) will be
      deleted from the panel. Similarly, if you replace a previously assigned
      <strong>Diverging</strong> signal head with a blank entry (no signal head), the previous
      entry is deleted and the crossover will not have a signal head at that position. <strong>If a
      signal head is changed, you must redo any logic that involves it.</strong></p>

      <p>Check <strong>Add Signal Icon to Panel</strong> to request that an icon for a signal head
      be placed on the panel at the turnout position indicated. This tool can only place a signal
      icon on a turnout that is almost vertical or almost horizontal. If this is not so, a message
      is printed, and you should place the signal icon manually using the Layout Editor tool bar.
      Regardless, the signal head name is assigned to the specified turnout position.</p>

      <p>Check <strong>Set up Logic</strong> to request that the tool set up a Simple Signal Logic
      for a signal head. The tool will create the logic and automatically fill in entries from the
      information available. If the tool does not have enough information available to set up the
      logic, a message results, and you will have to return later after more signals have been
      assigned to turnouts and block boundaries on the panel.</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <p>When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within a block until it finds a signal
      at the end of the block away from the turnout being signaled. If your layout contains
      sections that are signaled and sections that are not, to get this tool to set up logic
      correctly, you may have to place a virtual signal (a signal that does not correspond to an
      actual signal on the layout) at the unsignaled end of the block that connects a section of
      track that is signaled with track that is not signaled. If a block ends with an end bumper,
      no signal is required at the end bumper end.</p>

      <p>If a block has an internal turnout (the turnout, and the track segments at its throat and
      continuing legs are within the block), the program will expect signals at that turnout even
      if it's not at the end of the block. However, at times the user may not want to signal a
      seldom used turnout within a block. When following track through a block, the program will
      skip over unsignaled internal turnouts if <strong>Skip Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</strong>
      is checked in the Layout Editor <strong>Tools</strong> menu. It will always, however, warn
      that it is doing so. <strong>Use this option with caution.</strong> There is no signal
      protecting against a skipped turnout being set incorrectly, so if an unsignaled internal
      turnout is not set correctly, derailed trains could result.</p>

      <p>This tool sets up three-aspect signaling. With crossovers, the crossover tracks are always
      considered side track, and any mainline track entering the turnout, leaves on the same
      straight as it entered. So, if the crossover is in the crossover state, limited speed (the
      least restrictive is not green, but yellow) is set up (see the four-turnout diagram above).
      If you would prefer not to have limited speed when the turnout is set to crossover, edit the
      Simple Signal Logic by selecting <strong>Edit Logic...</strong> in the turnout's popup menu,
      uncheck <strong>Limited Speed</strong>, and click <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>

      <p>If you have a special situation at a signal, you may have to do more editing of
      information entered by this tool into the Simple Signal Logic. If you would like four-aspect
      signaling, you can easily manually edit the logic to achieve this. Similarly, by simple hand
      edits of the logic, you can add approach lighting. The Simple Signal Logic dialog can be
      accessed from the popup menu of each signal icon. If your special situation cannot be handled
      by Simple Signal Logic, you should refer to Logix to tailor the signal logic to your
      needs.</p>

      <p><strong>Please remember to save your Panel after using this tool.</strong>
