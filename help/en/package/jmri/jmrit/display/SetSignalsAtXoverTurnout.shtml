      <h1>Set Signals at Crossover</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tool provides an automated procedure for assigning
      signals to a crossover turnout, either a double crossover, a
      right-handed single crossover, or a left-handed single
      crossover. If requested, this tool will place signal icons on
      the panel at the specified turnout, and will set up signal
      logic for specified signal heads. Prior to selecting this
      tool, the turnout must be on the panel, and required signal
      heads must be in the Signal Head Table. This tool places
      signal heads only when the main track of the turnout is
      vertical or horizontal (or mostly vertical or horizontal) on
      the panel, so design your panel accordingly. The Simple
      Signal Logic created by this tool only works correctly if
      each of the track segments connected to the four connection
      points of the crossover are assigned to different blocks.</p>

      <p>When this item is selected in the <b>Tools</b> menu, a
      small dialog is shown for entry of the turnout name (system
      or user) of a crossover turnout. If this tool is entered by
      selecting <b>Set Signals...</b> in the crossover turnout's
      popup menu, the turnout name is automatically entered. After
      the crossover turnout name has been entered and verified, a
      dialog is shown for entry of the names (system or user) of
      four to eight signal heads to be assigned to the crossover
      turnout.</p>

      <p>Crossover turnouts differ from other turnouts in several
      important ways. Like other turnouts, crossovers have two
      states--crossed (Thrown) and straight (Closed). To change a
      crossover's state, however, requires two or four track
      switches to change in unison. This may be accomplished using
      one to four switch machines. Normally a crossover is assigned
      a single turnout entry in the turnout table, but it may have
      several if its switch machines are controlled by different
      stationary decoders. You can use two JMRI routes controlled
      by the same internal turnout to make multiple switch machines
      work together. In this case, enter the internal turnout as
      the turnout linked to the crossover turnout drawing.</p>

      <p>For each signal head, check boxes are available for
      selecting whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and
      whether Simple Signal Logic is to be created for the signal
      head. Regardless of whether icons are placed or logic is
      created, Layout Editor will record that the entered signal
      heads are assigned to the specified crossover turnout.</p>

      <p><b>Assigning signal heads to turnouts is important to
      completely describe your layout in Layout Editor.</b> Even if
      you elect to place your icons and set up your signal logic
      manually, you should use this tool to assign the signal heads
      to their crossover turnout.</p>

      <h2>The Set Signals at Crossover Dialog</h2>

      <p>If prompted to enter the <b>Turnout Name</b>, enter the
      name (system or user) of the crossover turnout to which the
      signal heads will be assigned. If the tool cannot find the
      entered turnout on the panel, an error message results. Also
      if the entered turnout is not a crossover turnout, an error
      message results. If an internal turnout is used to control
      the crossover (see above), enter its name in the <b>Turnout
      Name</b> field.</p>

      <p>Signal Head names (either system or user) are entered in
      the large dialog. Entry of two signals at each corner of the
      double crossover turnout is provided for. For left-handed
      crossovers or right-handed crossovers, the tool provides for
      two signals at each throat corner, and one signal at each
      continuing track corner. At least one <b>Continuing</b>
      signal head must be entered at each corner, but the
      <b>Diverging</b> entries are optional. The corner labels, A,
      B, C, and D are as shown below for the double crossover case
      of all eight signal heads and the double crossover turnout in
      the straight through (Closed) position. (In the diagram
      below, the double crossover turnout has not been
      rotated.)</p>

      <p><a href="./images/DoubleXover8.gif"><img src=
      "./images/DoubleXover8.gif" width="207"
      height="109" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a></p>

      <p>Similarly, the diagram below shows the four-signal-head
      case with a double crossover turnout in the crossover
      (Thrown) position. If you rotate the turnout, the corner
      labels rotate also. Single crossovers are the same, except
      with one crossover track instead of two.</p>

      <p><a href="./images/DoubleXover4.gif"><img src=
      "./images/DoubleXover4.gif" width="221"
      height="113" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a></p>

      <p>If signal heads at this crossover turnout have been
      entered previously, click <b>Get Saved</b> to retrieve the
      signal head names previously entered.</p>

      <p>Any of the corners that can have two signals, may actually
      have either one or two signals, so all cases in between the
      two illustrated above are possible. Single crossovers may
      have 4, 5, or 6 signal heads, and double crossovers may have
      4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 signal heads. If a signal head is entered
      for <b>Diverging</b>, then the <b>Continuing</b> head signals
      the straight through track and the <b>Diverging</b> head
      signals the crossover track. If no signal head is entered for
      <b>Diverging</b>, the <b>Continuing</b> signal head reflects
      the state of whichever track the turnout is switched to. In
      that case, the Simple Signal Logic type for the
      <b>Continuing</b> signal head is <b>On Facing-Point
      Turnout</b>.</p>

      <p>If there was a signal head previously assigned to any
      position, and you enter a <i>different</i> signal head in the
      same place, the new signal head will replace the previous
      signal head, and the icon of the previous signal head (if
      there was one) will be deleted from the panel. Similarly, if
      you replace a previously assigned <b>Diverging</b> signal
      head with a blank entry (no signal head), the previous entry
      is deleted and the crossover will not have a signal head at
      that position. <b>If a signal head is changed, you must redo
      any logic that involves it.</b></p>

      <p>Check <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> to request that an
      icon for a signal head be placed on the panel at the turnout
      position indicated. This tool can only place a signal icon on
      a turnout that is almost vertical or almost horizontal. If
      this is not so, a message is printed, and you should place
      the signal icon manually using the Layout Editor tool bar.
      Regardless, the signal head name is assigned to the specified
      turnout position.</p>

      <p>Check <b>Set up Logic</b> to request that the tool set up
      a Simple Signal Logic for a signal head. The tool will create
      the logic and automatically fill in entries from the
      information available. If the tool does not have enough
      information available to set up the logic, a message results,
      and you will have to return later after more signals have
      been assigned to turnouts and block boundaries on the
      panel.</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <p>When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within
      a block until it finds a signal at the end of the block away
      from the turnout being signaled. If your layout contains
      sections that are signaled and sections that are not, to get
      this tool to set up logic correctly, you may have to place a
      virtual signal (a signal that does not correspond to an
      actual signal on the layout) at the unsignaled end of the
      block that connects a section of track that is signaled with
      track that is not signaled. If a block ends with an end
      bumper, no signal is required at the end bumper end.</p>

      <p>If a block has an internal turnout (the turnout, and the
      track segments at its throat and continuing legs are within
      the block), the program will expect signals at that turnout
      even if it's not at the end of the block. However, at times
      the user may not want to signal a seldom used turnout within
      a block. When following track through a block, the program
      will skip over unsignaled internal turnouts if <b>Skip
      Unsignaled Internal Turnouts</b> is checked in the Layout
      Editor <b>Tools</b> menu. It will always, however, warn that
      it is doing so. <b>Use this option with caution.</b> There is
      no signal protecting against a skipped turnout being set
      incorrectly, so if an unsignaled internal turnout is not set
      correctly, derailed trains could result.</p>

      <p>This tool sets up three-aspect signaling. With crossovers,
      the crossover tracks are always considered side track, and
      any mainline track entering the turnout, leaves on the same
      straight as it entered. So, if the crossover is in the
      crossover state, limited speed (the least restrictive is not
      green, but yellow) is set up (see the four-turnout diagram
      above). If you would prefer not to have limited speed when
      the turnout is set to crossover, edit the Simple Signal Logic
      by selecting <b>Edit Logic...</b> in the turnout's popup
      menu, uncheck <b>Limited Speed</b>, and click
      <b>Apply</b>.</p>

      <p>If you have a special situation at a signal, you may have
      to do more editing of information entered by this tool into
      the Simple Signal Logic. If you would like four-aspect
      signaling, you can easily manually edit the logic to achieve
      this. Similarly, by simple hand edits of the logic, you can
      add approach lighting. The Simple Signal Logic dialog can be
      accessed from the popup menu of each signal icon. If your
      special situation cannot be handled by Simple Signal Logic,
      you should refer to Logix to tailor the signal logic to your
      needs.</p>

      tool.</b></p>
