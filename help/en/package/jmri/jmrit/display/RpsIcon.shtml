<h1> 
JMRI: RPS Icon
</h1>

RPS is a system for measuring the positions of rolling stock on your
layout.  RPS Reporter icons move around on the panel to show
where the corresponding equipment is on the layout.

<em>This page is still under construction, but the RPS icon 
support itself is already present in JMRI. Go ahead and try it out!</em>
<p>

RPS icons are a way of putting icons on a 
<a href="PanelEditor.shtml">panel</a>
that will move around as the RPS system finds the location of
an associated transmitter.

<h2>Adding an RPS Icon to a Panel</h2>

<em>Section still needs lots of work</em><p>

Click "Add RPS reporter" on the 
<a href="PanelEditor.shtml">panel editor</a>.
An RPS icon will appear on the panel at the 
default location and start working.
<p>
RIght-click or option-click on the icon to see the popup menu, where
you can calibrate the icon.

<p>
Don't forget to save your panel!

<h2>Popup Menu</h2>

The popup menu for an RPS icon contains:
<dl>
<dt>RPS Position Readout
<dd>This is just a title; selecting it doesn't do anything

<dt>Rotate
<dd>Rotates how the icon is displayed, in 90-degree increments.  Note that
this is not a rotation of the RPS coordinate system, but merely of the
icon presentation.

<dt>Set Origin
<dd>Sets the current display position of the icon as the 0,0 position
of the RPS system.  This must be done as the first step in calibration.

<dt>Set Current Location
<dd>Changes the calibration so that it's position on the screen
and the RPS measurement agree.  To use this, first make sure that the
RPS system has made a good measurement of the transmitters position, then
drag the icon to where it should appear on the screen, and finally
choose "Set Current Location" from the popup menu. In the future, 
when the RPS system measures the same location, the icon will appear 
in that position.

<dt>Not Calibrated
<dd>Not a control, this is used to indicate whether the
icon has been calibrated so that it's position on the screen properly
reflects the location that RPS has measured.

<dt>Disable
<dd>Controls whether or not the icon can be dragged around manually.

<dt>Remove
<dd>Removes the RPS icon from the panel.  This is a permanent removal.

<dt>Help
<dd>Shows this page

</dl>

<h2>Customization</h2>

Although there is not yet a graphical interface for this yet (it's coming!),
you can modify the icon for a transmitter that's being tracked by 
the RPS system so that it displays e.g. the locomotive number, or even a
small picture of the locomotive.  To do this, you'll edit the
panel definition file directly.  (There's more information on the
XML format we use 
<a href="../../../../html/apps/DecoderPro/IntroXML.shtml">here</a>) The steps are:
<ul>
<li>Create the icon on the panel editor, and save the panel into a file.
<li>Make a backup copy of the file, in case something goes wrong.
<li>Using a text editor, open the file to change it.
<li>Find the line that defines the icon.  It will contain the string "RpsPositionIconXml", 
so one approach is to search for that. It will look something like:
<code><pre>
    &lt;sensoricon x="95" y="150" level="10" active="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-occupied.gif" error="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-error.gif" rotate="0" forcecontroloff="false" momentary="false" sxscale="11.849106591612951" syscale="-11.889381744148094" sxorigin="41" syorigin="768" class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.RpsPositionIconXml" /&gt;
</pre></code>
<li>To make the icon track a specific transmitter, enter the transmitter's ID as a "filter" attribute.  For example, to 
have it track transmitter 5510, change the line to:
<code><pre>
    &lt;sensoricon filter="5510" x="95" y="150" level="10" active="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-occupied.gif" error="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-error.gif" rotate="0" forcecontroloff="false" momentary="false" sxscale="11.849106591612951" syscale="-11.889381744148094" sxorigin="41" syorigin="768" class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.RpsPositionIconXml" /&gt;
</pre></code>
<li>The "active" and "error" attributes are the icons to be displayed when the system is 
getting good readings and not getting good readings, respectively. 
You can change these to the location of any icon file you'd like.
For example, you can change them to a (small) photo of
a locomotive, or to an image with the train number.
</UL>

A nice graphical interface for this is coming, but it's not here yet.
