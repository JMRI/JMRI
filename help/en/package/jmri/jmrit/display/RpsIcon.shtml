      <h1>JMRI: RPS Icon</h1>RPS is a system for measuring the
      positions of rolling stock on your layout. More information
      on RPS is available on the <a href=
      "../../../../html/hardware/rps/index.shtml">main RPS help
      page</a>. RPS Reporter icons move around on the panel to show
      where the corresponding equipment is on the layout.

      <p><img src="../../../../images/bangdesk.gif" align="right"
      height="45" width="45" alt="Cute image of work"> <em>This
      page is still under construction, but the RPS icon support
      itself is already present in JMRI. Go ahead and try it
      out!</em></p>

      <p>RPS icons are a way of putting icons on a <a href=
      "PanelEditor.shtml">panel</a> that will move around as the
      RPS system finds the location of an associated
      transmitter.</p>

      <h2>Adding an RPS Icon to a Panel</h2>Usually, each RPS icon
      represents one RPS transmitter, hence one locomotive.
      Currently, you need to add one for each RPS-equipped piece of
      equipment you want to track. Although this is a pain, it
      gives you very fine control over which transmitter's
      positions are displayed and how they are presented.
      <em>Section still needs lots of work</em>

      <p>Click "Add RPS reporter" on the <a href=
      "PanelEditor.shtml">panel editor</a>. An RPS icon will appear
      on the panel at the default location, but it won't work yet
      until it's calibrated.</p>

      <p>Right-click or option-click on the icon to see the popup
      menu, where you can calibrate the icon.</p>

      <h3>Calibrating an RPS Icon</h3>When you calibrate an RPS
      icon, you're specifying how RPS measured locations correspond
      to positions on the panel.

      <p>The steps are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Stop the RPS system polling, so things won't move
        around on you.</li>

        <li>Add the icon to the panel.</li>

        <li>Drag the icon until it sits over the position that
        corresponds to the 0,0 origin of your RPS
        installation.</li>

        <li>Right-click or option-click on the icon to get the
        pop-up menu, and select "Set Origin".</li>

        <li>Move the actual locomotive to some other point on the
        layout, and start the RPS system polling again. Get a good
        measurement of the position. Stop the RPS system.</li>

        <li>Drag the icon to where you want it to be on the screen
        when the transmitter is in that location.</li>

        <li>From the icon's popup menu, select "Set Current
        Location".</li>

        <li>Get the popup menu again. It should no longer say "Not
        Calibrated", and instead should show you the current
        position.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Don't forget to save your panel!</p>

      <h2><a id="popup" name="popup">Popup Menu</a></h2>
      <p>The popup menu for an RPS icon contains:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>RPS Position Readout</dt>

        <dd>This is just a title; selecting it doesn't do
        anything</dd>

        <dt>Rotate</dt>

        <dd>Rotates how the icon is displayed, in 90-degree
        increments. Note that this is not a rotation of the RPS
        coordinate system, but merely of the icon
        presentation.</dd>

        <dt>Show ID</dt>

        <dd>When checked, the ID string will be displayed in
        addition to the icon.</dd>

        <dt>Set Origin</dt>

        <dd>Sets the current display position of the icon as the
        0,0 position of the RPS system. This must be done as the
        first step in calibration.</dd>

        <dt>Set Current Location</dt>

        <dd>Changes the calibration so that it's position on the
        screen and the RPS measurement agree. To use this, first
        make sure that the RPS system has made a good measurement
        of the transmitters position, then drag the icon to where
        it should appear on the screen, and finally choose "Set
        Current Location" from the popup menu. In the future, when
        the RPS system measures the same location, the icon will
        appear in that position.</dd>

        <dt>Not Calibrated</dt>

        <dd>A status message, not a control, this appears when the
        icon has not been calibrated. Calibration ensure the icon's
        position on the screen properly reflects the location that
        RPS has measured.</dd>

        <dt>At (x), (y)</dt>

        <dd>Once the icon has been calibrated, the popup menu
        displays the most recent RPS location measurement.</dd>

        <dt>Show ID</dt>

        <dd>If checked, the icon will have it's ID information
        displayed next to it.</dd>

        <dt>Set Filter</dt>

        <dd>Opens a window that lets you enter a filter value for
        this icon.</dd>

        <dt>Disable</dt>

        <dd>Controls whether or not the icon can be dragged around
        manually.</dd>

        <dt>Remove</dt>

        <dd>Removes the RPS icon from the panel. This is a
        permanent deletion.</dd>

      <h2><a id="filter" name="filter">Filtering and Multiple
      Locomotives</a></h2>We're still
      trying to figure out how best to configure multiple icons on
      a panel. A single icon, with no special settings, will hop
      around as readings come in. It will go to the position of one
      reading, and then move directly to the position of the next
      reading, which might come from another locomotive
      transmitter.

      <p>If you want to have multiple icons, each showing the
      position of a single locomotive, you can configure filters on
      each icon.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add an RPS icon to the panel</li>

        <li>Open the icon's pop-up menu, and select "Set
        Filter".</li>

        <li>This will open a small window in which you can enter
        the ID value for the locomotive you want this icon to
        track. Once you've done this, the icon will only move to
        the position measured for this locomotive.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This method is a little tedious, particularly if you have
      a large roster, since you'll have to do it manually for each
      locomotive. And you'll have to calibrate them all. (One good
      way to do this is to copy the lines defining one icon in the
      panel file, in effect making a bunch of duplicate calibrated
      icons, and then set the filters; see below). But it has the
      advantage that you can control exactly which locomotives to
      display and which not to. This method also allows you to
      <a href="#custicon">attach custom images</a> (e.g. a picture
      of a specific locomotive) to the specific icon that
      represents each ID. <a id="custom" name="custom"></a></p>

      <h2>Customization</h2>

      <h3>Starting Position</h3>When you first open the panel, the
      icons are put back to the same position on the screen that
      they occupied when the screen was saved to the file.

      <p>You can use this to e.g. put the icons out of the way
      initially. They'll stay in that position until a valid
      reading moves them, so you can use this to "park" locomotives
      that are not on the track off the active part of the panel.
      <a id="custicon" name="custicon"></a></p>

      <h3>Displaying a Custom Icon</h3>Although there is not yet a
      graphical interface for this yet (it's coming!), you can
      modify the icon for a transmitter that's being tracked by the
      RPS system so that it displays e.g. a small picture of the
      locomotive. To do this, you'll edit the panel definition file
      directly. (There's more information on the XML format we use
      <a href=
      "../../../../html/apps/DecoderPro/IntroXML.shtml">here</a>)
      The steps are:

      <ul>
        <li>Create the icon on the panel editor, and save the panel
        into a file.</li>

        <li>Make a backup copy of the file, in case something goes
        wrong.</li>

        <li>Using a text editor, open the file to change it.</li>

        <li>Find the line that defines the icon. It will contain
        the string "RpsPositionIconXml", so one approach is to
        search for that. It will look something like (it'll
        probably be all on one line):
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">

    &lt;sensoricon x="95" y="150" level="10" 
            active="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-occupied.gif" 
            error="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-error.gif" 
            rotate="0" forcecontroloff="false" momentary="false" 
            sxscale="11.849106591612951" syscale="-11.889381744148094" 
            sxorigin="41" syorigin="768" 
            class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.RpsPositionIconXml" /&gt;
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>To make the icon track a specific transmitter, enter
        the transmitter's ID as a "filter" attribute. For example,
        to have it track transmitter 5510, change the line to:
          <pre style="font-family: monospace;">

    &lt;sensoricon filter="5510" x="95" y="150" level="10" 
            active="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-occupied.gif" 
            error="resources/icons/smallschematics/tracksegments/circuit-error.gif" 
            rotate="0" forcecontroloff="false" momentary="false" s
            xscale="11.849106591612951" syscale="-11.889381744148094" 
            sxorigin="41" syorigin="768" 
            class="jmri.jmrit.display.configurexml.RpsPositionIconXml" /&gt;
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>The "active" and "error" attributes are the icons to be
        displayed when the system is getting good readings and not
        getting good readings, respectively. You can change these
        to the location of any icon file you'd like. For example,
        you can change them to a (small) photo of a locomotive, or
        to an image with the train number.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A nice graphical interface for this is coming, but it's
      not here yet.</p>
