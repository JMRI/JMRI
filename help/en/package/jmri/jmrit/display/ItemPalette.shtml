      <h1>The Item Palette</h1>
      <b>The Item Palette</b> is used to
      place icons and text onto <b>Control Panel Editor</b> panels.
      The palette is a tabbed window with tabs for each item type.
      The common method all items use to add an item to a panel is
      "Drag and Drop". Each tab has a bordered <b>Preview</b> panel
      containing a labeled <b>Drag to Panel</b> panel. Drag the
      item inside this border over
      to your Panel. In the cases where the icon represents a layout
      device (e.g. a turnout, a sensor, etc.), tab may also contain
      a table of elements configured for that device type.  select a
      row from a table to associate that particular device with the
      icon - and then drag the icon to the Panel.
      <p>
      The window shown when the <b>Edit XYZ</b> menu item of a panel
      item is invoked shows the corresponding Item Palette tab pane
      without the labeled <b>Drag to Panel</b> panel.</p>

      <h2>Iconic Items</h2>
      Some device types need a set of icons to depict each of their
      states The Item Palette provides multiple sets of icons to
      choose from to associate with a device. There is a radio button
      for each icon set defined for the tab item. For
      example, under the sensor tab you may have sets of large
      jewels, small jewels, each size with several sets with
      different colors for active and inactive - e.g. red-green,
      yellow-dark, etc.
      <p>
      The individual icons are displayed in the preview on the
      background of the last editor to open the Item Palette.
      <span class="since">since 4.9.7</span>
      Choosing a different background in the "View On:" combo box,
      may help in determining what parts of the icon are opaque
      and what parts are transparent.</p>

      <h3>Editing and Creating New Icon Sets</h3>
	  <ul>
	  		<li>The <b>Show Icons</b> button displays all the icons in the
      		selected set.
      		</li><li>
            The <b>Edit Icons</b> button opens a dialog where the icons
             may be changed by dragging new icons from the Icon Catalog.
             Also the name may be changed with <b>Rename Icon set</b>
      		</li><li>
      		Additional icon sets may be added with <b>New Icon Set</b>
            button. After giving a name to the new icon set, the edit
            dialog is displayed with all the states of the device
            represented with "red X" icons. Replace the red X icons with icons you
            drag from the catalogs. There is no limit on the number of
            additional icon sets that can be added to an item tab.
      		</li><li>
      		The <b>Delete Family Icon Set</b> button deletes the selected
            icon set.</li>
		</ul>
      When the Item Palette is customized by editing icon sets
      or by adding of deleting sets, exiting PanelPro
      will open a dialog box asking whether you want to save your
      changes. When changes are saved the Item Palette is stored in
      the CatalogTrees.xml file in the preferences directory.

      <h3>Table Items</h3>
      The items associated with a table (eg. Turnouts, Sensors,
      Lights, Signal Heads) have a pick list of their items displayed.
      Under the table is a <b>Add New Table Item</b>
      button. This button opens the corresponding device table from
      the <b>Tools</b> menu for you to create a new device item.
      <br>Tabs with tables require a device to be selected (a
      row in the table) before the an icon can be dragged to a
      control panel to represent it.

      <h3>Special Cases</h3>
      <span class="since">Since 4.21</span><br>
      Should all of the icon sets of a device type be deleted, a
      <b>Restore Defaults</b> button is displayed. This button
      reinstalls the default icons listed in the file
      JMRI/xml/defaultPanelIcons.xml. Holding the keys <b>Ctrl</b>
      and <b>A</b> down while clicking the <b>New Icon Set</b>
      button will reinstall any missing default icon sets for that
      tab.
      <p>
      Before 4.21 the Indicator Turnout tab always showed buttons to
      add and delete status icons when the <b>Edit Icons</b> button
      was pressed. Now these (advanced) buttons are displayed only if
      the keys <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>A</b> are held down while clicking
      <b>Edit Icons</b>.</p>

      <h2>Item Palette Tabs</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Turnout</b> Both left and right turnout icon sets
        are contained in this tab. Select a turnout from the table
        and an icon set for either Right, Left, R/L Crossover,
        then drag to the panel.</li>

        <li><b>Sensor</b> Select a sensor from the table and an
        icon set, then drag to the panel.</li>

        <li><b>SignalHead</b> When a signal head is selected in the
        table, the [Show Icons] button will only display the icons
        for the valid appearances of the signal. When no row is
        selected all possible appearance icons are shown. When
        adding a new icon set, all possible appearance icons are
        shown.</li>

        <li><b>SignalMast</b> A signal mast must be selected from
        the table to drag icons for it to the panel and to display
        the icons it uses for its aspects.</li>

        <li><b>Memory</b> Select a memory location from the table.
        The four memory types each have a "Drag to Panel" area.
        Drag the item within the bordered "Drag to Panel" to the
        panel. Note that <b>Input</b> and <b>Spinner</b> types can
        only be dragged from the edges of their text boxes.</li>

        <li><b>Reporter</b> Select a reporter from the table and
        drag the item within the bordered "Drag to Panel" to the
        panel.</li>

        <li><b>Light</b> Select a light from the table and an icon
        set for either Crossed symbol, Right or Left and drag to
        the panel.</li>

        <li><b>Multisensor</b> The table displays the Sensor Table
        and the default icon set has three lever positions. For the
        default case, three rows must be selected in order from the
        table to place the multisensor icon in a panel.
        The table selections
        are labeled "first", "second", etc. and these labels
        correspond to the labels shown when the full icon set is
        displayed. When editing or creating a Multisensor icon set,
        lever positions can be added and deleted. That is, you may
        make a two sensor multisensor or a four or five sensor icon
        set. Use the <b>Add Icon</b> or <b>Delete Icon</b> button
        to add or delete lever positions.</li>

        <li><b>Icon</b> The bordered icons displayed (labeled with
        their names) can be dragged directly to a panel. Icons can
        also be dragged directly from the Icon Catalog. to add icons
        to this tab, just drop them into the preview panel from
        the Icon Catalog.</li>

        <li><b>Background</b> Background icons are placed in a
        panel just as regular icons are. However, they are assigned
        the lowest display level and cannot be selected with a
        simple mouse click. Use "Control Click" to select a
        background icon. Rather than an icon, a custom background
        color can be chosen with the <b>Color Chooser</b>
        button. This button displays a color chooser with tabs for
        different ways to set a color.</li>

        <li><b>Text</b> The Text tab displays a text field to enter
        the text and the attribute options that renders the text.
        Font sizes styles, justification and border attributes can
        be chosen. A color chooser provides custom colors for
        fonts, background and borders.<br>
        Drag the item in the Preview Panel to the panel.</li>

        <li><b>RPSReporter</b> Drag the "Drag to Panel" icon to the
        panel and setup the RPSReporter from its pop up menu.</li>

        <li><b>FastClock</b> Drag the clock to the panel.</li>

        <li><b>Indicator Track</b>
        <span class="since">since 2.12</span> These are intended for
        use when track circuits are configured with OBlocks. Most
        of the items in this tab pertain to their use as
        presentations of OBlocks and their use with warrants.
        However, if OBlocks are not defined, but occupancy sensors
        are installed on the layout as track circuits, the
        <b>Occupancy Circuit</b> field will accept a sensor name.
        When this is the case only the "Occupied" and "Clear"
        colors can be displayed.</li>

        <li><b>Indicator Turnout</b> The above comment also applies to
        Indicator Turnouts.</li>

        <li><b>Portal</b> Portal icons are used in Circuit Builder to
        define Portals and Paths. On the Control Panel they also
        will display direction arrows along a route when Warrants
        are allocated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>More about Indicator Track</h2>
      Indicator track (i.e. both track segments and turnouts)
      have colors to display status of
      the track circuit they represent. When the track circuit is
      configured by an OBlock, and the Portals and Paths it
      contains, the following status states will be displayed by
      color:

      <ul>
        <li><b>Clear</b> Indicates ready for use. More precisely,
        the circuit is in a known state and none of the other status
        apply.</li>

        <li><b>Occupied</b> (Yellow) The track is occupied by an
        unknown train or car.</li>

        <li><b>Allocated</b> (Green) The track is reserved for use
        by a warrant.</li>

        <li><b>Train Position</b> (Blue) The track is occupied by a
        train under warrant and this is its current position.</li>

        <li><b>Not In Use</b> (Gray) The state of the track is not
        known or it has been set to be out of service. This state
        is also used when local control of blocks is granted from a
        panel.</li>

        <li><b>Power Error</b> (Red) This is the state of another
        sensor - not the occupancy sensor. If used, most likely it
        would be wired to indicate a short or power failure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Indicator Track Tab</h3>
      Enter the name of the track
      circuit (OBlock) this track icon represents into the
      <b>Occupancy Circuit</b> field. The <b>Open Detector
      Picklist</b> button opens a picklist showing the defined
      OBlock track circuits. Drag or copy the name to the Occupancy
      Circuit field. <i><b>Do Not use</b> the "Sensor Table" tab of
      the picklist <b>unless</b> there are no OBlocks configured
      and you only want to use the "Occupied/Unoccupied"
      status.</i>

      <p>When a valid OBlock name is entered in the Occupancy
      Circuit field and the icon dragged and dropped onto the panel,
      after selectiing it a <b>CircuitPath</b> panel is added to the tab
      showing all the paths that have been defined for the OBlock.
      Check the paths of the track circuit that pass over this
      icon. When these paths are part of an allocated route or are
      occupied by a warranted train, they show that status by
      color.</p>

      <p>Below the Occupancy Circuit field is a checkbox labeled
      <b>Display Train Name when occupied</b>. When a warranted
      train occupies the track circuit, circuit icons having this
      box checked, show a marker with the occupying train's id.
      Most likely, you will only want one of the icons in the track
      circuit to display the train id.</p>

      <h3>Indicator Turnout Tab</h3>
      This tab has the same functions as the Indicator Track tab
      with the addition of a turnout table. A turnout must be
      selected from the Turnout Table to be able to drag an icon
      to a control panel.

      <p>The <b>[Show Icons]</b> button displays the icon set in
      a matrix where the rows show the status icons for each state
      of the turnout - Closed, Thrown, Inconsistent, and Unknown.
      </p><p>
      When an <b>Edit Icons</b> window is displayed all icons are shown,
      Icons from the Icon Catalog may be dragged and dropped to any
      icon shown.
