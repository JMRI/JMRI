      <h1>The Item Palette</h1>
      <strong>The Item Palette</strong> is used to place icons and text onto <strong>Control Panel
      Editor</strong> panels. The palette is a tabbed window with tabs for each item type. The
      common method all items use to add an item to a panel is "Drag and Drop". Each tab has a
      bordered <strong>Preview</strong> panel containing a labeled <strong>Drag to Panel</strong>
      panel. Drag the item inside this border over to your Panel. In the cases where the icon
      represents a layout device (e.g. a turnout, a sensor, etc.), tab may also contain a table of
      elements configured for that device type. select a row from a table to associate that
      particular device with the icon - and then drag the icon to the Panel.
      <p>The window shown when the <strong>Edit XYZ</strong> menu item of a panel item is invoked
      shows the corresponding Item Palette tab pane without the labeled <strong>Drag to
      Panel</strong> panel.</p>

      <h2>Iconic Items</h2>
      Some device types need a set of icons to depict each of their states The Item Palette
      provides multiple sets of icons to choose from to associate with a device. There is a radio
      button for each icon set defined for the tab item. For example, under the sensor tab you may
      have sets of large jewels, small jewels, each size with several sets with different colors
      for active and inactive - e.g. red-green, yellow-dark, etc.
      <p>The individual icons are displayed in the preview on the background of the last editor to
      open the Item Palette. <span class="since">since 4.9.7</span> Choosing a different background
      in the "View On:" combo box, may help in determining what parts of the icon are opaque and
      what parts are transparent.</p>

      <h3>Editing and Creating New Icon Sets</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Show Icons</strong> button displays all the icons in the selected set.</li>

        <li>The <strong>Edit Icons</strong> button opens a dialog where the icons may be changed by
        dragging new icons from the Icon Catalog. Also the name may be changed with <strong>Rename
        Icon set</strong></li>

        <li>Additional icon sets may be added with <strong>New Icon Set</strong> button. After
        giving a name to the new icon set, the edit dialog is displayed with all the states of the
        device represented with "red X" icons. Replace the red X icons with icons you drag from the
        catalogs. There is no limit on the number of additional icon sets that can be added to an
        item tab.</li>

        <li>The <strong>Delete Family Icon Set</strong> button deletes the selected icon set.</li>
      </ul>
      When the Item Palette is customized by editing icon sets or by adding of deleting sets,
      exiting PanelPro will open a dialog box asking whether you want to save your changes. When
      changes are saved the Item Palette is stored in the CatalogTrees.xml file in the preferences
      directory.
      <h3>Table Items</h3>
      The items associated with a table (eg. Turnouts, Sensors, Lights, Signal Heads) have a pick
      list of their items displayed. Under the table is a <strong>Add New Table Item</strong>
      button. This button opens the corresponding device table from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu
      for you to create a new device item.<br>
      Tabs with tables require a device to be selected (a row in the table) before the an icon can
      be dragged to a control panel to represent it.
      <h3>Special Cases</h3>
      <span class="since">Since 4.21</span><br>
      Should all of the icon sets of a device type be deleted, a <strong>Restore Defaults</strong>
      button is displayed. This button reinstalls the default icons listed in the file
      JMRI/xml/defaultPanelIcons.xml. Holding the keys <strong>Ctrl</strong> and <strong>A</strong>
      down while clicking the <strong>New Icon Set</strong> button will reinstall any missing
      default icon sets for that tab.
      <p>Before 4.21 the Indicator Turnout tab always showed buttons to add and delete status icons
      when the <strong>Edit Icons</strong> button was pressed. Now these (advanced) buttons are
      displayed only if the keys <strong>Ctrl</strong> and <strong>A</strong> are held down while
      clicking <strong>Edit Icons</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Item Palette Tabs</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Turnout</strong> Both left and right turnout icon sets are contained in this
        tab. Select a turnout from the table and an icon set for either Right, Left, R/L Crossover,
        then drag to the panel.</li>

        <li><strong>Sensor</strong> Select a sensor from the table and an icon set, then drag to
        the panel.</li>

        <li><strong>SignalHead</strong> When a signal head is selected in the table, the [Show
        Icons] button will only display the icons for the valid appearances of the signal. When no
        row is selected all possible appearance icons are shown. When adding a new icon set, all
        possible appearance icons are shown.</li>

        <li><strong>SignalMast</strong> A signal mast must be selected from the table to drag icons
        for it to the panel and to display the icons it uses for its aspects.</li>

        <li><strong>Memory</strong> Select a memory location from the table. The four memory types
        each have a "Drag to Panel" area. Drag the item within the bordered "Drag to Panel" to the
        panel. Note that <strong>Input</strong> and <strong>Spinner</strong> types can only be
        dragged from the edges of their text boxes.</li>

        <li><strong>Reporter</strong> Select a reporter from the table and drag the item within the
        bordered "Drag to Panel" to the panel.</li>

        <li><strong>Light</strong> Select a light from the table and an icon set for either Crossed
        symbol, Right or Left and drag to the panel.</li>

        <li><strong>Multisensor</strong> The table displays the Sensor Table and the default icon
        set has three lever positions. For the default case, three rows must be selected in order
        from the table to place the multisensor icon in a panel. The table selections are labeled
        "first", "second", etc. and these labels correspond to the labels shown when the full icon
        set is displayed. When editing or creating a Multisensor icon set, lever positions can be
        added and deleted. That is, you may make a two sensor multisensor or a four or five sensor
        icon set. Use the <strong>Add Icon</strong> or <strong>Delete Icon</strong> button to add
        or delete lever positions.</li>

        <li><strong>Icon</strong> The bordered icons displayed (labeled with their names) can be
        dragged directly to a panel. Icons can also be dragged directly from the Icon Catalog. to
        add icons to this tab, just drop them into the preview panel from the Icon Catalog.</li>

        <li><strong>Background</strong> Background icons are placed in a panel just as regular
        icons are. However, they are assigned the lowest display level and cannot be selected with
        a simple mouse click. Use "Control Click" to select a background icon. Rather than an icon,
        a custom background color can be chosen with the <strong>Color Chooser</strong> button.
        This button displays a color chooser with tabs for different ways to set a color.</li>

        <li><strong>Text</strong> The Text tab displays a text field to enter the text and the
        attribute options that renders the text. Font sizes styles, justification and border
        attributes can be chosen. A color chooser provides custom colors for fonts, background and
        borders.<br>
        Drag the item in the Preview Panel to the panel.</li>

        <li><strong>RPSReporter</strong> Drag the "Drag to Panel" icon to the panel and setup the
        RPSReporter from its pop up menu.</li>

        <li><strong>FastClock</strong> Drag the clock to the panel.</li>

        <li><strong>Indicator Track</strong> <span class="since">since 2.12</span> These are
        intended for use when track circuits are configured with OBlocks. Most of the items in this
        tab pertain to their use as presentations of OBlocks and their use with warrants. However,
        if OBlocks are not defined, but occupancy sensors are installed on the layout as track
        circuits, the <strong>Occupancy Circuit</strong> field will accept a sensor name. When this
        is the case only the "Occupied" and "Clear" colors can be displayed.</li>

        <li><strong>Indicator Turnout</strong> The above comment also applies to Indicator
        Turnouts.</li>

        <li><strong>Portal</strong> Portal icons are used in Circuit Builder to define Portals and
        Paths. On the Control Panel they also will display direction arrows along a route when
        Warrants are allocated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>More about Indicator Track</h2>
      Indicator track (i.e. both track segments and turnouts) have colors to display status of the
      track circuit they represent. When the track circuit is configured by an OBlock, and the
      Portals and Paths it contains, the following status states will be displayed by color:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear</strong> Indicates ready for use. More precisely, the circuit is in a
        known state and none of the other status apply.</li>

        <li><strong>Occupied</strong> (Yellow) The track is occupied by an unknown train or
        car.</li>

        <li><strong>Allocated</strong> (Green) The track is reserved for use by a warrant.</li>

        <li><strong>Train Position</strong> (Blue) The track is occupied by a train under warrant
        and this is its current position.</li>

        <li><strong>Not In Use</strong> (Gray) The state of the track is not known or it has been
        set to be out of service. This state is also used when local control of blocks is granted
        from a panel.</li>

        <li><strong>Power Error</strong> (Red) This is the state of another sensor - not the
        occupancy sensor. If used, most likely it would be wired to indicate a short or power
        failure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Indicator Track Tab</h3>
      Enter the name of the track circuit (OBlock) this track icon represents into the
      <strong>Occupancy Circuit</strong> field. The <strong>Open Detector Picklist</strong> button
      opens a picklist showing the defined OBlock track circuits. Drag or copy the name to the
      Occupancy Circuit field. <em><strong>Do Not use</strong> the "Sensor Table" tab of the
      picklist <strong>unless</strong> there are no OBlocks configured and you only want to use the
      "Occupied/Unoccupied" status.</em>
      <p>When a valid OBlock name is entered in the Occupancy Circuit field and the icon dragged
      and dropped onto the panel, after selectiing it a <strong>CircuitPath</strong> panel is added
      to the tab showing all the paths that have been defined for the OBlock. Check the paths of
      the track circuit that pass over this icon. When these paths are part of an allocated route
      or are occupied by a warranted train, they show that status by color.</p>

      <p>Below the Occupancy Circuit field is a checkbox labeled <strong>Display Train Name when
      occupied</strong>. When a warranted train occupies the track circuit, circuit icons having
      this box checked, show a marker with the occupying train's id. Most likely, you will only
      want one of the icons in the track circuit to display the train id.</p>

      <h3>Indicator Turnout Tab</h3>
      This tab has the same functions as the Indicator Track tab with the addition of a turnout
      table. A turnout must be selected from the Turnout Table to be able to drag an icon to a
      control panel.
      <p>The <strong>[Show Icons]</strong> button displays the icon set in a matrix where the rows
      show the status icons for each state of the turnout - Closed, Thrown, Inconsistent, and
      Unknown.</p>

      <p>When an <strong>Edit Icons</strong> window is displayed all icons are shown, Icons from
      the Icon Catalog may be dragged and dropped to any icon shown.</p>
