<H2>Set Signals at Turnout
</H2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This tool provides an automated procedure for assigning signals to a turnout. 
Right-handed turnouts, left-handed turnouts, and wye turnouts are supported. 
If requested, this tool will place signal icons on the panel at the specified 
turnout, and will set up Simple Signal Logic for the specified signal heads. 
Prior to selecting this tool, the turnout must be on the panel, and the required 
signal heads must be in the Signal Table. This tool only works correctly when 
the main track of the turnout is vertical or horizontal (or mostly vertical or 
horizontal) on the panel, so design your panel accordingly.</p>
<p>
When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of the turnout name 
(system or user), and the names of the three or four signal heads to be assigned 
to the turnout. For each signal head, check boxes are available for selecting 
whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and whether Simple Signal Logic 
is to be created for the signal head. Regardless of whether icons 
are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record that the entered 
signal heads are assigned to the specified turnout.</p>

<h3>The Set Signals at Turnout Dialog</h3>
<p>
In the <b>Turnout Name</b> field, enter the name (system or user) of the 
turnout to which the signal heads will be assigned. If the tool cannot find
the entered turnout on the panel, an error message results.</p> 
<p>
Signal Head names (either system or user) are entered in the next section. 
The <b>Throat - Diverging</b> entry is optional, but the other three must 
be entered. If signal heads at this turnout have been entered previously, 
click <b>Get Saved</b> to retrieve the signal head names previously entered.
The titles used for the four signal heads follow the model shown below.</p>
<p>
<A href="./images/TurnoutSignalModel.gif"><IMG SRC="./images/TurnoutSignalModel.gif" 
ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="75" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"></A>
</p>
<p>
If a signal head is entered for <b>Throat - Diverging</b>, then <b>Throat - 
Continuing</b> signals the continuing track and <b>Throat - Diverging</b> 
signals the diverging track. If no signal head is entered for 
<b>Throat - Diverging</b>, the <b>Throat - Continuing</b> signal head reflects
the state of whichever track the turnout is switched to. In that case, the
logic type for the <b>Throat - Continuing</b> signal head is 
<b>On Facing-Point Turnout</b>.</p>
<p>
Note: If there was a signal head previously assigned to one of the two
positions, and you enter a <i>different</i> signal head in the same place, 
the new signal head will replace the previous signal head, and the icon of
the previous signal head (if there is one) will be deleted from the 
panel.</p>
<p>
Check <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> to request that an icon for a signal 
head be placed on the panel at the turnout position indicated. This tool 
can only place a signal icon on a turnout that is almost vertical or almost 
horizontal. If this is not so, a message is printed, and you should place 
the signal icon manually using the Layout Editor tool bar. Regardless, the 
signal head name is assigned to the specified  turnout position.</p>
<p>
Check <b>Set up Logic</b> to request that the tool set up a Simple 
Signal Logic for a signal head. The tool will create the logic and
automatically fill in entries from the information available. If
the tool does not have enough information available to set up the 
logic, a message results, and you will have to return later after 
more signals have been assigned to turnouts and block boundaries on the
panel.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within 
a block until it finds a signal at the end of the block away from the 
turnout being signalled.  If your layout contains sections that are 
signalled and sections that are not, to get this tool to set up logic
correctly, you may have to place a virtual signal (a signal that does 
not correspond to an actual signal on the layout) at 
the unsignalled end of the block that connects a section of track that is 
signalled with track that is not signalled. If a block ends with an 
end bumper, no signal is required at the end bumper end.</p>
<p>
This tool sets up three-aspect signalling. If the diverging route through
the turnout is not mainline track, limited speed (the least restrictive 
is not green, but yellow) is set up. If you have a special situation at a 
signal, you may have to edit the information entered by the tool. If you 
would like four-aspect signalling, you can easily manually edit the logic 
to achieve this. Similarly, by simple hand edits of the logic, you can
add approach lighting. The Simple Signal Logic dialog can
be accessed from the popup menu of the signal icon. If your special 
situation cannot be handled by Simple Signal Logic, you should refer
to Logix to tailor the signal logic to your needs.</p>
