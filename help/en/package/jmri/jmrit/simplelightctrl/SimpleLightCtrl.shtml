      <h1>Light Control</h1>Enter the light system name for the
      light you wish to control in the box to right of "light:".
      For example, entering 678 and by pressing either the On or
      Off button, you should be able to change the state of light
      number 678 on the layout. Another example, a valid light
      system name for PowerLine devices could be PL9. Then by
      pressing either the On or Off button, you should be able to
      change the state of light on the layout. Another example, a
      valid light system name could be IL123 which is internal
      light number 123. Pressing On or Off will only change the
      state of the internal light and will not change a light on
      the layout. See " <a href=
      "../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Names</a> "
      under general help for more information.

      <h2>Light Control Buttons and Status</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>Current State:</dt>

        <dd>Shows the current known state of the light.</dd>

        <dd>
          <dl>
            <dt>&lt;Unknown&gt;</dt>

            <dd>Either no light selected or invalid light
            name.</dd>

            <dt>Off</dt>

            <dd>Light is at minimum intensity if variable intensity
            supported, or off.</dd>

            <dt>On</dt>

            <dd>Light is at maximum intensity if variable intensity
            supported, or full on.</dd>

            <dt>Intermediate</dt>

            <dd>Light intensity is between 0 and 100% and the
            current intensity is equal to the target
            intensity.</dd>

            <dt>Transitioning Higher</dt>

            <dd>Target intensity is higher than the current
            intensity and light is adjusting every fast minute
            according to Transition Time value.</dd>

            <dt>Transitioning Lower</dt>

            <dd>Target intensity is lower than the current
            intensity and light is adjusting every fast minute
            according to Transition Time value.</dd>

            <dt>Transitioning to Full On</dt>

            <dd>Target intensity is higher than the current
            intensity, and equal or higher than maximum intensity
            and light is adjusting every fast minute according to
            Transition Time value.</dd>

            <dt>Transitioning to Full Off</dt>

            <dd>Target intensity is lower than the current
            intensity, and equal or lower than minimum intensity
            and light is adjusting every fast minute according to
            Transition Time value.</dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>

        <dt>Configuration Options of Lights:</dt>

        <dd>
          <dl>
            <dt>Enabled:</dt>

            <dd>The light will respond to its automatic control
            type.</dd>

            <dt>Variable:</dt>

            <dd>Light may be commanded to values between 0% and
            100%.</dd>

            <dt>Transitional:</dt>

            <dd>Changes of intensity will use the transition time
            to step between current and target intensity.</dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>

        <dt>On</dt>

        <dd>Push this button to turn on the light.</dd>

        <dt>Off</dt>

        <dd>Push this button to turn off the light.</dd>

        <dt>Change Intensity</dt>

        <dd>Enter a new value for the light (0% to 100%) and
        pressing this button will set the new target intensity. If
        transitional is supported if will use the transition time
        for computing how fast to move from current intensity to
        the new target intensity.</dd>

        <dt>Minimum Intensity:</dt>

        <dd>A value 0 to 100 (percent) that sets the lowest amount
        of light that will be output by a dim command. An explicit
        off command will ignore this value.</dd>

        <dt>Maximum Intensity:</dt>

        <dd>A value 0 to 100 (percent) that sets the highest amount
        of light that will be output by a dim command. An explicit
        on command will ignore this value.</dd>

        <dt>Transition Time:</dt>

        <dd>Number of fast minutes to go from 0% to 100% intensity.
        A value of zero will cause the device to change from one
        intensity to new intensity as fast as the device is able to
        do so.</dd>
