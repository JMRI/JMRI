      <h2>Adding a new Light</h2>
      To add a new Light, follow this procedure:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click <b>Lights</b> in the <b>Tables</b> submenu of
          the <b>Tools</b> menu to bring up the <b><a href=
          "LightTable.shtml">Light Table</a></b>, and click the
          <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom of the <b>Light
          Table</b> pane to bring up the <b>Add Light</b> pane.</p><img src=
          "images/LightAddFrame.png" height="398" width="577">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <b>System Connection</b> if your layout is
          connected to more than one system or to create an Internal Light.<br>
          Next enter the <b>Hardware Address</b> of your new Light
          (often entered as a number, look at the Tooltip for accepted
          <a href="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml#entrysummary">
          entry patterns per system</a>).
          This is the address JMRI will
          send to your system when switching the Light.<br>From this
          information, the program will make a <b>System Name</b>
          in the JMRI convention, appropriate for a Light in the
          selected System using the entered address.<br>
          When you hover your mouse over the Hardware Address entry field,
          a tooltip will display accepted entry example (depending
          on availability).<br>
          Some examples of valid System Names are: CL1004, and LL401
          (entered as '401' here), assuming you have the hardware
          for the addressed digital output bits.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter a User Name. Any string of characters that is
          different from the User Name of other Lights will be
          accepted, but it's wise to use a string that describes
          the intended use of the Light. Entry of a User Name is
          optional.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you wish to enter a Control for your new Light,
          click the <b>Add Control</b> button, and enter your
          choices into the <b>Add Light Control</b> pane which
          appears. You may enter as many Light Controls as desired.
          More information on Light Controls <a href=
          "#lightcontrol">below</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Each Light Control is displayed in the Light Control
          table on the Add Light and Edit Light pane.
          The <b>Control Type</b> is shown on the left,
          followed by a <b>Description</b> of the Control
          mechanism. These are followed by <b>Edit</b> and
          <b>Delete</b> buttons. Click <b>Edit</b> to bring up
          the <b>Edit Light Control</b> pane allowing changes
          to the control specification as described above.
          Click a <b>Delete</b> button to remove a Light Control.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Next is the notes area of the Add Light pane.
          This is where instructions and error messages will appear
          as you create (or edit) a Light. Always check this area to
          see if things went as expected.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the
          window. If everything is fine, a message stating "New
          Light added ... " will be displayed in the notes area. If
          there is trouble with anything, an error or warning
          message will be displayed in the notes area:<br>
          <img src="images/LightAddErrorBar.png" height="97" width=
          "301"><br>
          Correct the error and click <b>Create</b> again.</p>

          <p>-OR-</p>

          <p>Click the <b>Close</b> button to dismiss the pane
          without creating any more Lights.</p>
        </li>
      </ol><a name="addManyLight" id="addManyLight"></a>

      <h2>Adding several new Lights at Once</h2>
      If the selected
      <b>System Connection</b> supports adding multiple Lights at once, the
      <b>Add Light</b> pane will display two additional
      items, marked in purple:

      <p><img src="images/LightAddManyFrame.png" height="399" width=
      "576"></p>

      <p>Adding several new Lights at once is optional. If you only
      want to add one new Light, ignore the <b>Add a sequential
      range</b> check box and the <b>Number of items:</b> entry.<br>
      If you want to add several new Lights with sequential hardware
      addresses, check the <b>Add a sequential range</b> check box.<br>
      When this box is checked, the <b>Number of items:</b> field is
      activated. Set the number of Lights you want to
      add. Enter other properties for the first Light, following the
      procedure above, and click the <b>Create</b> button. If any of the
      requested addresses are not available (previously assigned to
      a Light or a Turnout by the same address), a message will appear in the notes
      area, and no new Lights will be created.<br>
      If everything checks out, the requested Lights will be created, and
      a message will appear in the notes area at the bottom of the pane.</p>

      <p>Adding multiple Lights at once is intended to support
      stationary decoders which require several addresses in
      sequence. As a result, restrictions apply when creating
      several Lights at once. Note the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The addresses must be numerical -- only numbers are
          allowed in the hardware address.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The addresses of the created Lights must be
          consecutive.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>All requested addresses must be available, i.e., not
          currently assigned to a Light or Turnout.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If a User Name is entered, each of the created Lights
          after the first will have that User Name with ":1", ":2", etc.
          appended.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Entered Light Control items and Variable Intensity
          items will be assigned to the first Light created, and
          not to subsequent Lights. These items may be added by
          manual Editing (see next paragraph).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Editing an existing Light</h2>
      To edit an existing Light, follow this procedure:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click on a Light's <b>Edit</b> button in the
          <a href="LightTable.shtml">Light Table</a> to bring up
          the <b>Edit Light</b> pane:</p>
          <img src="images/LightEditFrame.png" height="351" width="578">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The <b>System Name:</b> of the Light is displayed at
          the top of the pane and cannot be changed once created.
          <br>
          The <b>User Name</b> may be changed either here or by double
          clicking on it in the Light Table.<br>
          The Light Control and notes areas are the same as above.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>After making changes to the Light information, click
          <b>Update</b> to change the selected Light. If there is
          any trouble, an error or warning message will be
          displayed in the notes area, and the update is stopped
          for you to correct the error and click <b>Update</b>
          again. If all is fine, the Light is changed and the
          <b>Add/Edit Light</b> pane is dismissed.</p>

          <p>-OR-</p>

          <p>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit edit mode without changing
          the selected Light. If the <b>Edit Light</b> pane is
          dismissed (closed) while in edit mode, <b>Cancel</b> is
          automatically selected, and no changes are made to the
          selected Light.</p>

      <h2>Automated Control Options for Lights</h2>

      <p>The <b>Add/Edit Light Control</b> window is used to
      specify a Light control. Automated operation of a Light can be
      controlled in one or more of the following ways:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>By Sensor</b> - The Light will be turned <b>ON</b>
          when the Sensor changes to Active or Inactive, depending
          upon the choice made in the <b>Sense for ON</b> popup
          menu, and it will be turned <b>OFF</b>, when the Sensor
          reverses state. Specify the Sensor by entering its name
          (System Name or User Name) in the <b>Sensor Name</b>
          field. This option has a number of uses, including
          setting a fascia panel light to follow block occupancy.
          That is useful, for example, for monitoring train
          position in a hidden staging area.</p><img src=
          "images/LightAddFrameSensor.png" height="177" width="280">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>By Fast Clock</b> - The Light will be turned
          <b>ON</b> when the Fast Clock reaches the time entered in
          <b>Time On</b> and will be turned <b>OFF</b> when the
          Fast Clock reaches the time entered in <b>Time Off</b>.
          The times are entered in "hh:mm" format, where "hh" is
          hours and "mm" is minutes for a 24-hour clock. One use of
          this option is to turn on and off scenery lighting,
          street lights, house lights, etc. to simulate night time
          on the layout.</p><img src="images/LightAddFrameClock.png"
          height="175" width="273">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>By Turnout Status</b> - The Light will be turned
          <b>ON</b> when the Turnout changes to Closed or Thrown,
          depending upon the choice made in the <b>Status for
          ON</b> popup menu, and it will be turned <b>OFF</b>, when
          the Turnout reverses its status. Specify the Turnout by
          entering its name (System Name or User Name) in the
          <b>Turnout Name</b> field. This option may be used to set
          a fascia panel light to follow the status of a Turnout.
          That is useful, for example, for monitoring the status of
          hidden turnouts.</p><img src="images/LightAddFrameTurnout.png"
          height="177" width="273">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>By Timed ON</b> - The Light will be turned
          <b>ON</b> when the trigger sensor changes to active, and
          it will be turned <b>OFF</b>, when the specified time has
          elapsed. Specify the trigger Sensor by entering its name
          (System Name or User Name) in the <b>Trigger Sensor
          Name</b> field. Enter the time the Light is to remain on
          (in milliseconds) in the <b>Duration ON</b> field. This
          option has a number of uses, it was originally designed
          to turn on an electromagnetic decoupler in response to a
          fascia pushbutton, but it can also be used for other
          types of layout animation, for example, to control the
          ringing of a crossing bell when a train enters a
          block.</p><img src="images/LightAddFrameTimed.png" height="176"
          width="281">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>By Two Sensors</b> - The Light will be turned
          <b>ON</b> when the either of the two Sensors changes to
          Active or Inactive, depending upon the choice made in the
          <b>Sense for ON</b> popup menu, and it will be turned
          <b>OFF</b>, when both of the two Sensors are in the
          reverse state. Specify each Sensor by entering its name
          (System Name or User Name) in the <b>Sensor Name</b>
          field. The order of entry does not matter. This option
          has multiple uses, such as controlling crossing gates
          with point sensors that detect when a train passes. By
          placing two point sensors, one at each end of a bridge, a
          layout sound for a bridge rumble may be played while the
          train is traversing the bridge.</p><img src=
          "images/LightFrameTwoSensor.png" height="176" width="474">

      <h3>Light Control Cautions</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>After have set a Sensor or a Turnout as part of
          a Light Control, be very careful about changing the User
          Name of your Sensor or Turnout. A simple change of User
          Name could break your Light Control definitions.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you enter multiple Light Controls for the same
          Light, it is possible that the Light Controls might
          conflict or overlap with each other, producing strange
          results. <b>The user is responsible for ensuring that
          Light Controls do not conflict.</b></p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <a name="varLight" id="varLight"></a>
      <h2>Working with Variable Intensity Lights</h2>
      If the selected <b>System Connection</b> supports Lights
      with variable intensity, the <b>Add Light</b> and
      <b>Edit Light</b> panes will display the <b>Variable
      Intensity</b> area:

      <p><img src="images/LightAddVariable.png" height="449" width=
      "648"></p>

      <p>Systems like
      <a href="../../../../html/hardware/powerline/index.shtml">PowerLine</a>,
      that support variable intensity
      lights also support lights with fixed intensity. If you are
      adding a Light with fixed intensity, i.e. an ON/OFF light,
      just leave the items in the <b>Variable Intensity</b> area as set.
      When editing a simple ON/OFF light on a system not supporting variable
      lights, the items in the <b>Variable Intensity</b> area are
      not displayed.</p>

      <p>The intensity of a Light is represented internally by the
      range from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being brightest. Intensity
      limits are entered as percentages, from 0 through 100, in the
      Minimum Intensity and Maximum Intensity boxes. Because the
      actual light hardware has only finite resolution, the
      intensity value is mapped to the nearest supported
      setting.</p>

      <p>Each Light has a <b>Target Intensity</b> property which
      can be set using a script or other code. Attempting to set the <b>Target
      Intensity</b> outside the <b>Minimum Intensity to Maximum
      Intensity</b> range will result in the <b>Target
      Intensity</b> being set to the relevant limit.</p>
