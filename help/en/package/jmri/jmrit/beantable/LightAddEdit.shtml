      <h2><a name="addLight" id="addLight">Adding a new Light</a></h2>
      <p>To add a new Light:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click <b>Lights</b> in the <b>Tables</b> submenu of
          the <b>Tools</b> menu to bring up the <b><a href=
          "LightTable.shtml">Light Table</a></b>, and click the
          <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom of the <b>Light
          Table</b> to bring up the <b>Add Light</b> window.</p><img src=
          "images/Light-Add-Frame-662x371.png" alt="Add Light Window" height="371" width="662">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <b>System Connection</b> if your layout is
          connected to more than one system or to create an Internal Light.<br>
          Next enter the <b>Hardware Address</b> of your new Light
          (often entered as a number, look at the Tooltip for accepted
          <a href="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml#entrysummary">
          entry patterns per system</a>).
          This is the address JMRI will
          send to your system when switching the Light.<br>From this
          information, the program will make a <b>System Name</b>
          in the JMRI convention, appropriate for a Light in the
          selected System using the entered address.<br>
          When you hover your mouse over the Hardware Address entry field,
          a tooltip will display accepted entry example (depending
          on availability).<br>
          Some examples of valid System Names are: CL1004, and LL401
          (entered as '401' here), assuming you have the hardware
          for the addressed digital output bits.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>Enter a System Name, according to the JMRI convention.
        The first letter designates your hardware system ('L' for
        LocoNet, 'C" for C/MRI, etc.), and the second letter must
        be 'L' for Light. These are followed by a number that gives
        the hardware address of the digital output bit being
        referenced. Examples of valid system addresses are:
        <code>CL1004</code> and <code>LL401</code>, assuming you
        have the hardware for the addressed digital output
        bits.</li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter a User Name. Any string of characters that is
          different from the User Name of other Lights will be
          accepted, but it's wise to use a string that describes
          the intended use of the Light. Entry of a User Name is
          optional.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>Enter a User Name. Any string of characters that is
        different from the User Name of other Lights will be
        accepted, but it's wise to use a string that describes the
        intended use or layout location of the Light.</li>


        <li>Enter the required information to complete the control
        definition in the fields that appear. If you need to enter
        a Sensor name or a Turnout name, you must enter the name
        (System Name or User Name) of an existing Sensor or
        Turnout.
        <br><b>Caution</b>: if you choose to enter a User
        Name, be careful about changing the User Name of your
        Sensor or Turnout afterwards. A simple change of User Name
        could break your Light controller definition.</li>

        <li>Next is the notes area of the Add/Edit Light window.
        This is where instructions and error messages will appear
        as you create or edit a Light. Always check this area to
        see if things went as expected.</li>

        <li>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the
        window. If everything is fine, a message stating "New Light
        added... " will be displayed in the notes area. If there is
        trouble with anything, an error or warning message will be
        displayed in the notes area; you should then correct the
        error and click <b>Create</b> again.</li>


        <li>
          <p>If you wish to enter a Controller for your new Light,
          click the <b>Add Controller</b> button, and enter your
          choices into the <b>Add Light Controller</b> window which
          appears. You may enter as many Light Controllers as desired.
          More information on Light Controllers <a href=
          "#lightcontrol">below</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Each Light Controller is displayed in the Light Controller
          table on the Add Light and Edit Light window.
          The <b>Controller Type</b> is shown on the left,
          followed by a <b>Description</b> of the Controller
          mechanism. These are followed by <b>Edit</b> and
          <b>Delete</b> buttons. Click <b>Edit</b> to bring up
          the <b>Edit Light Control</b> window allowing changes
          to the control specification as described above.
          Click a <b>Delete</b> button to remove a Light Controller.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Next is the notes area of the Add Light window.
          This is where instructions and error messages will appear
          as you create (or edit) a Light. Always check this area to
          see if things went as expected.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the
          window. If everything is fine, a message stating "New
          Light added ... " will be displayed in the notes area. If
          there is trouble with anything, an error or warning
          message will be displayed in the notes area:<br>

          Correct the error and click <b>Create</b> again.</p>

          <p>-OR-</p>

          <p>Click the <b>Close</b> button to dismiss the window
          without creating any more Lights.</p>
        </li>
      </ol><a name="addManyLight" id="addManyLight"></a>

      <h2>Adding several new Lights at Once</h2>
      If the selected
      <b>System Connection</b> supports adding multiple Lights at once, the
      <b>Add Light</b> window will display two additional
      items, marked in purple:

      <p><img src="images/LightAddManyFrame.png" height="399" width=
      "576" alt="Add Multiple Lights"></p>

      <p>Adding several new Lights at once is optional.</p>
      
      <p>If you want to add several new Lights with sequential hardware
      addresses, check the <b>Add a sequential range</b> check box.
      <br>When this box is checked, the <b>Number of items:</b> field is
      activated.
      <br>Set the number of Lights you want to
      add. Enter other properties for the first Light, following the
      procedure above, and click the <b>Create</b> button. 
      
      If any of the
      requested addresses are not available (previously assigned to
      a Light or a Turnout by the same address), a message will appear in the notes
      area, and no new Lights will be created.
      
      <br>If everything checks out, the requested Lights will be created, and
      a message will appear in the notes area at the bottom of the window.</p>

      <p>Adding multiple Lights at once is intended to support
      stationary decoders which require several addresses in
      sequence. As a result, restrictions apply when creating
      several Lights at once. Note the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The addresses must be numerical -- only numbers are
          allowed in the hardware address.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The addresses of the created Lights must be
          consecutive.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>All requested addresses must be available, i.e., not
          currently assigned to a Light or Turnout.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If a User Name is entered, each of the created Lights
          after the first will have that User Name with ":1", ":2", etc.
          appended.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Entered Light Controller items and Variable Intensity
          items will be assigned to the first Light created, and
          not to subsequent Lights. These items may be added by
          manual Editing (see next paragraph).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="editLight" id="editLight">Editing an existing Light</a></h2>
      To edit an existing Light,

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click on a Light's <b>Edit</b> button in the
          <a href="LightTable.shtml">Light Table</a> to bring up
          the <b>Edit Light</b> window:</p>
          <img src="images/Light-Edit-Frame-662x370.png" height="370" width="662" alt="Edit Light Window">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The <b>System Name:</b> of the Light is displayed at
          the top of the window and cannot be changed once created.
          <br>
          The <b>User Name</b> may be changed either here or by double
          clicking on it in the Light Table.<br>
          The Light Controller and notes areas are the same as above.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <p>After making changes to the Light information, click
          <b>Update</b> to change the selected Light. If there is
          any trouble, an error or warning message will be
          displayed in the notes area, and the update is stopped
          for you to correct the error and click <b>Update</b>
          again. If all is fine, the Light is changed and the
          <b>Add/Edit Light</b> window is closed.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>After making changes to the Light information, click
        <b>Update</b> to change the selected Light. If everything
        is fine, a message stating "Light updated... " will be
        displayed in the notes area. If there is any trouble, an
        error or warning message will be displayed in the notes
        area, and the update is stopped for you to correct the
        error and click <b>Update</b> again.

      <p>The Light Table contains an 'Enabled' column. For a Light Controller
      to be triggered it must be enabled, the default option on startup and Light creation.</p>
      
      <p>You can uncheck this
      box to temporarily disable a Light from being triggered, i.e.
      prevent it switching when its control mechanism fires.</p>
          <p>The Light Controller will not update status if the Light is disabled in the Light Table.</p>
      
      <p>While adding or editing a Light, click on the Add Controller button.</p>

        height="203" width="310" alt="No Light Controller selected">


      <p>The <b>Add/Edit Light Controller</b> window is used to
      specify a Light controller. Automated operation of a Light can be
      controlled in one or more of the following ways:</p>

      <h4><a name="lightcontrolturnout" id="lightcontrolturnout">Light Controlled by Turnout</a></h4>
          <p>The Light will be turned
          <b>ON</b> when the Turnout changes to Closed or Thrown,
          depending upon the choice made in the <b>Status for
          ON</b> popup menu, and it will be turned <b>OFF</b>, when
          the Turnout reverses its status.</p>
          <p>Select the Turnout in the <b>Turnout Name</b> dropdown.</p>
          <p>This option may be used to set
          a fascia panel light to follow the status of a Turnout.
          That is useful, for example, for monitoring the status of
          hidden turnouts.</p>

    <h4><a name="lightcontrolonesensor" id="lightcontrolonesensor">Light Controlled by Sensor</a></h4>

          <p>The Light will be turned <b>ON</b>
          when the Sensor changes to Active or Inactive, depending
          upon the choice made in the <b>Sense for ON</b> popup
          menu, and it will be turned <b>OFF</b>, when the Sensor
          reverses state.</p> 
          <p>Select the Sensor in the dropdown select.</p> 
          <p>This option has a number of uses, including
          setting a fascia panel light to follow block occupancy.
          That is useful, for example, for monitoring train
          position in a hidden staging area.</p>

          Active or Inactive, depending upon the choice made in the
          <b>Sense for ON</b> popup menu, and it will be turned
          <b>OFF</b>, when both of the two Sensors are in the
          reverse state.</p> 
          <p>Select each Sensor in the dropdown menu.</p>
          <p>The order of entry does not matter.</p>
          <p>This option
          has multiple uses, such as controlling crossing gates
          with point sensors that detect when a train passes. By
          placing two point sensors, one at each end of a bridge, a
          layout sound for a bridge rumble may be played while the
          train is traversing the bridge.</p>

    <h4><a name="lightcontrolfastclock" id="lightcontrolfastclock">Light Controlled by Fast Clock Follower</a></h4>

          <p>Each time the minute is updated, the 
          Light Controller will check if the Light should be On or Off,
          and set the Light accordingly.</p>
          
          
          <p>The Light will be turned

          <p>Hours are entered in "hh" format between 00 and 23.
          <br>Minutes are entered in "mm" format between 00 and 59.
          <p>One use of
          this option is to turn on and off scenery lighting,
          street lights, house lights, etc. to simulate night time
          on the layout.</p>

          <li>A Fast Clock Following Light Controller is ON between 01:00 and 02:00</li>
          <li>At 01:36:21 something sets the Light OFF</li>
          <li>At 01:37:00 on the next minute update, the Light will be set back ON.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This could be useful for the night-time random bathroom light scenarios,
          or even star shimmers. You'd only need 1 Sensor or Turnout Controller action 
          to trigger the Light On, 
          knowing that the FastClock Follower will reset it back to OFF pretty soon.</p>
          
          <p>On startup, the Fast Clock will be checked, and the light will be set to
          correspond with the current time setting.</p>
          
          <p>If no Fast Clock is present on your system, the current local time will be used.</p>
          
          <p>To stop one Light Controller turning the Light ON, and the other turning the Light OFF,
         only the most recent action time is used as the Light value, eg the following controls:</p>

          <p>This option has a number of uses, it was originally designed
          to turn on an electromagnetic decoupler in response to a
          fascia pushbutton, but it can also be used for other
          types of layout animation, for example, to control the

      <h3>Multiple Light Controls</h3>
      
        <p>Multiple Fast Clock Follower Controllers on a single Light will act as a group.</p>
        <p>All other Light Controllers act independently, no matter what order they are placed in the list
         and may set the Light at any time, no matter the status of any other Light Controllers.</p>
        
      
      <h3><a name="cautions" id="cautions">Light Controller Cautions</a></h3>

          <p>After setting a Sensor or a Turnout as part of
          a Light Controller, be very careful about changing the User
          Name of your Sensor or Turnout. A simple change of User
          Name could break your Light Control definitions.</p>

          <p>If you enter multiple Light Controllers for the same
          Light, it is possible that the Light Controllers might
          conflict or overlap with each other, producing strange
          results. <b>The user is responsible for ensuring that
          Light Controllers do not conflict.</b></p>
        

      
      <h2><a name="varLight" id="varLight">Working with Variable Intensity Lights</a></h2>
      If the selected <b>System Connection</b> supports Lights
      with variable intensity, the <b>Add Light</b> and
      <b>Edit Light</b> windows will display the <b>Variable
      Intensity</b> area:

      <p><img src="images/LightAddVariable.png" height="449" width=
      "648" alt="Add Variable Intensity Light"></p>

      <p>Systems like
      <a href="../../../../html/hardware/powerline/index.shtml">PowerLine</a>,
      that support variable intensity
      lights also support lights with fixed intensity. If you are
      adding a Light with fixed intensity, i.e. an ON/OFF light,
      just leave the items in the <b>Variable Intensity</b> area as set.
      When editing a simple ON/OFF light on a system not supporting variable
      lights, the items in the <b>Variable Intensity</b> area are
      not displayed.</p>

      <p>The intensity of a Light is represented internally by the
      range from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being brightest. Intensity
      limits are entered as percentages, from 0 through 100, in the
      Minimum Intensity and Maximum Intensity boxes. Because the
      actual light hardware has only finite resolution, the
      intensity value is mapped to the nearest supported
      setting.</p>

      <p>Each Light has a <b>Target Intensity</b> property which
      can be set using a script or other code. Attempting to set the <b>Target
      Intensity</b> outside the <b>Minimum Intensity to Maximum
      Intensity</b> range will result in the <b>Target
      Intensity</b> being set to the relevant limit.</p>
