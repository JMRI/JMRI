      <h1>Edit Block Window</h1>

      <p>The Edit Block pane allows you to edit the following
      tabs:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#basic">Basic</a></li>

        <li><a href="#sensor">Sensor</a></li>

        <li><a href="#reporter">Reporter</a></li>

        <li><a href="#physicaldetails">Physical Details</a></li>

        <li><a href="#usage">Usage</a></li>

        <li><a href="#properties">Properties</a></li>
      </ul><a name="basic" id="basic"></a>

      <h2>Basic</h2>

      <p>This provides basic information about the Block, as
      entered on its creation:</p>
      <img src="images/BlocksEditBasicTab.png" width="461" height="155">

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>System Name</b> - The system name of the Block.
          There is no functional requirement for a type letter in
          the System Name of a Block, but by convention we use 'B'
          for 'Block'. The default implementation is not
          system-specific, so a system letter of 'I' is
          appropriate. This leads to system names like "IB201".</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>User Name</b> - The user name of the Block. The
          user name of a Block created here may be set to any text.
          The user name for a Block created by Layout Editor is set
          by Layout Editor and should not be changed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Comment</b> - You may enter any text in this field
          that will help you distinguish this Block from other
          Blocks, or provide useful notes about its use.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <a name="sensor" id="sensor"></a>
      <h2>Sensor</h2>

      <p>This tab allows you to assign a Sensor to the Block to
      change the occupancy state. It also allows certain
      information about the Sensor to be changed:</p><img src=
      "images/BlocksEditSensorTab.png" width="460" height="193">

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Sensor</b> Select the Sensor from the drop down
          list that will be associated with this Block.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: none">You can edit the Sensor
        Debounce options from this tab; setting the Sensor Debounce
        helps to prevent false triggers of a Sensor being passed
        into the system and triggering other events in the system.
        Such false triggers could be due to a dirty piece of track
        or electrical interference.</li>

        <li>The <b>Use Global Debounce Values</b> check box, allows you
        to select if the sensor will use the default sensor
        debounce values if configured.</li>

        <li><b>Inactive Delay</b> and <b>Active
        Delay</b> allow you to specify the amount of time in
        milliseconds that the system waits before registering the
        state change of a sensor.</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="reporter" id="reporter"></a>
      <h2>Reporter</h2>
      <img src="images/BlocksEditReporterTab.png" width="460"
           height="62">

      <ul>
        <li><b>Reporter</b> Set the Reporter assigned to this
        Block. See the <a href="ReporterTable.shtml">Reporter
        Table</a>. Selecting a Reporter and clicking
        <strong>Apply</strong> puts the Reporter Value into the
        Block value.</li>

        <li>
          <b>Use Current</b> If we consider the scenario whereby
          we want to track a train around the layout, typically this
          is achieved via the use of Memory objects associated with
          Blocks. Until the train is known, we have nothing to
          track. Typically, we can manually type in the Train ID
          into a panel and then this is tracked around the layout
          based on Block occupancy. If, however, we have an
          attached device that can provide us with the Train ID,
          such as an RFID reader, we no longer need to manually
          type in the Train ID - the reader does this for us. In
          essence, the reader is little more than an 'intelligent'
          sensor - not only can it sense that 'something' is there,
          it can tell us which something it is. Now to the
          implementation. A Sensor is purely ACTIVE or INACTIVE -
          i.e. something is there or it isn't. A Reporter, however,
          can tell us one of the following:

          <ol>
            <li>'Hey, I'm seeing something right now - this is
            it'</li>

            <li>'Hmm, I'm not seeing anything right now'</li>

            <li>'Hey, I saw something a while back - this was
            it'</li>

            <li>'Hmm, I've not seen anything yet'</li>
          </ol>
          The first two are from the CurrentReport; the last
          two from LastReport. At start-up (assuming there is
          nothing within the range of the reader), both 2 and 4 are
          the initial state. Once something is seen, both 1 and 3
          return the same result. When the something is
          'out-of-range' 2 and 3 are then active. With 'Use
          Current' selected the Block value will switch between 1
          and 2, whereas with 'Use Current' unselected the Block
          value will switch between 3 and 4.
        </li>
      </ul>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Length</b> (optional) - Displays the length of the
        Block. Optionally, you may enter the length of the Block
        here. The length is used for automatic running of trains.
        If '0.0' is displayed, the length has not been entered. The
        entered length should be the actual length of the Block on
        the model railroad layout. Length is entered and displayed
        in either inches or centimeters, depending on which unit is
        next in the Block Table.</li>

        <li><b>Units</b> - Choose one of both as the unit for the
        Block Length</li>

        <li><b>Curvature</b> (optional) - Displays the curvature
        selected for the track in the Block. Curvature is used for
        automatic running of trains, and need not be entered if
        trains will not be run automatically. Curvature, if
        present, indicates to the computer that it should slow the
        train as it runs through the Block. If <b>None</b> or
        <b>Gradual</b> are selected, an automatic train will
        proceed at normal speed. <b>Tight</b> should be selected if
        the train should slow down some; <b>Severe</b> should be
        selected if the train should slow by a maximum amount. If
        the Block has variable curvature, your selection should be
        made according to the most limiting part of the Block.</li>

        <li><b>Speed</b> - The speed is used with certain
        automation tools and logic, to help determine the speed at
        which a train can be set through the block. It is also used
        by the Signal Mast Logic for determining which Aspect
        should be displayed in a signal path.<br>
        In the drop down list, you are presented a set of named
        fixed speeds that have been predefined in the
        signalSpeed.xml file, in addition to a global option.<br>
        It is also possible to enter a numerical value to represent
        a speed. The global value is set via the <b>Speeds</b> menu
        option.</li>

        <li><b>Permissive</b> - The Permissive option is used to
        identify Blocks that can be entered by another Train while
        it is already occupied. This option is used with certain
        automation tools and Logix to help determine if a Train can
        enter an occupied Block and what Aspect should be displayed
        on its Signal Mast.</li>
