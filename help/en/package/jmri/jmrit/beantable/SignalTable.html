<H2>The Signal Table
</H2>
    
All the signals that JMRI knows about can be referenced
using the "Signal Table" tool in the Tools menu of most JMRI programs.
There are five columns in the table:
<UL>
<LI>The system name is assigned to the signal when it's created, 
and can't be changed.
<LI>If you're interested in having your signals carry "human readable"
names, you can click in the "user name" column and change that information
to whatever you want.
<LI>As the signal changes, for whatever reason, the current
appearance will show in the table.  You can also click on the
appearance button to cycle through the avilable appearances:
red, yellow, green, flashing red, flashing yellow, flashing green, and dark.
<LI>The check box in the "Lit" column lets you control whether the
signal head on the layout is lit (checked) or stays dark (unchecked).
<LI>The check box in the "Held" column shows the "held" property of the
signal, and allows you to change it.  This property is used by e.g. CTC
machine logic to say "Don't change this signal head from red, even if it 
would be safe to do so, because I want to hold a train here".
</UL>
<P>To define a new signal, click on the 
"<A HREF="SignalAddEdit.html">Add.." button<a/>.
It will
prompt you for the type (run off turnout outputs; SE8c; etc), and
whatever setup information is needed.
<P> This information is saved with the configuration in an XML file, along
with control panel setup and similar stuff.  For more information
on creating and displaying panels, including how to show signals
on your panels,
please see the 
<A HREF="../apps/PanelPro/Panels.html">Panels pages</a>.
