      <h1>The Signal Mast Logic Table</h1>

      <p>A Signal Mast Logic for a certain Source Signal Mast
      consists of a Destination Signal Mast, one or more Turnouts,
      Blocks, Sensors or other Signal Masts that must be in a
      specific state before the source Signal Mast can be set from
      a "Danger" aspect.</p>

      <p>If you have correctly drawn up your layout on Layout
      Editor with all the block information then it is possible for
      the system to automatically build up all the Signal Mast
      source and destination pairs, along with Blocks, Turnouts and
      their settings.<br>
      This information is managed via the Signal Mast Logic
      Table.<br>

      "right"></a></p>

      <h3>Signal Mast Logic Table Columns</h3>

      <p>The information in the Signal Mast Logic Table is
      displayed in 8 columns:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>1. Source</dt>

        <dd>This is the Signal Mast that you wish to set the Signal
        Mast Logic up for. There can be multiple instances of a
        source Signal Mast in the Signal Mast Logic Table,
        depending upon the number of different destination Signal
        Masts that are reachable from the source Signal Mast on the
        layout.<br>
        Consider it as the Signal Mast that the engineer is
        currently facing.</dd>

        <dt>2. Appearance</dt>

        <dd>The current Appearance of the source Signal Mast.</dd>

        <dt>3. Destination</dt>

        <dd>This is the destination Signal Mast which is next down
        the line from the source Signal Mast. There can be multiple
        instances of the destination Signal Mast, each with a
        different source Signal Mast.</dd>

        <dt>4. Appearance</dt>

        <dd>The current Appearance of the destination Signal
        Mast.</dd>

        <dt>5. Comment</dt>

        <dd>A free form user editable field for the user to assign
        comment against the logic. Doubleclick the field to edit
        it.</dd>

        <dt>6. Delete</dt>

        <dd>Pushing one of the "Delete" buttons will remove that
        line of Signal Mast Logic from the table.<br>
        Note that this doesn't remove the Signal Mast Logic from
        any files you've saved that contain it. If you load one of
        those files, perhaps when you restart JMRI, the Signal Mast
        Logic will reappear. You should use one of the "Store to
        file" options in the "File" menu to save new versions of
        any files that contain the updated Signal Mast Logic.</dd>

        <dt>7. Enabled</dt>

        <dd>To disable a Signal Mast Logic from triggering, uncheck
        the "Enabled" box for the Signal Mast Logic.</dd>

        <dt>8. Edit</dt>

        <dd>Push the Edit button to edit that Signal Mast Logic.
        For more information see <a href=
        "AddEditSignalingLogic.shtml">Adding/Editing Signal Mast
        Logic</a>.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Add Signal Mast Logic</h3>

      <dl>
        <dd>This is done via the Add... button at the bottom of the
        window. For more information on editing and adding Signal
        Mast Logics see <a href=
        "AddEditSignalingLogic.shtml">Adding/Editing Signal Mast
        Logic</a>.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Saving changes</h2>To permanently save changes to the
      Signal Mast Logic Table, use one of the "Store to file"
      options in the "File" menu before quitting JMRI.
