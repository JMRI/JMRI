      <h1>The Block Table</h1>

      <p>Blocks may be set up manually in the Block Table, using a script, or automatically in a
      Layout Editor Panel. When a Block is defined in a Layout Editor Panel, a new Block is created
      if one does not already exist.</p>

      <p class="important">In Layout Editor, Blocks are identified by their <strong>User
      Name</strong>, so if a Block shown in the Block Table is used in a Layout Editor Panel, its
      User Name should not be changed here.<br>
      If you want to change the User Name of a Block used in a Layout Editor Panel, make the change
      in the Layout Editor, not in the Block Table.</p>

      <h2 id="blockPaths">Blocks & Paths</h2>

      <p>To complete the definition of a Block, Paths and Bean Settings must be attached to each
      Block.<br>
      <strong>Paths</strong> describe entry points to the Block. Each Block has one or more Paths
      associated with it. Sometimes a Turnout must be set a certain way to use a Path; Bean
      Settings carry that information. Paths and Bean Settings are set up automatically for Blocks
      defined in a Layout Editor Panel. They can also be set up in a script. There is currently no
      way to manually enter Paths or Bean Settings. Paths and Bean Settings are not shown in the
      Block Table, and are mentioned here only for completeness.</p>

      <p>For use in automatically running Trains, a Length attribute and a Curvature attribute may
      optionally be assigned to a Block. These optional attributes are entered manually in this
      Table. If Trains will not be run automatically through a Block, there is no need to add these
      attributes.</p>

      <h2>Columns in the Block Table</h2>
      (You may change the order of the columns by dragging their titles, and sort the rows by
      clicking one of the sort triangles next to a column title)
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>System Name</strong> - The System Name of the Block. There is no functional
          requirement for a type letter in the System Name of a Block, but by convention we use 'B'
          for 'Block'. The default implementation is not system-specific, so a system letter of 'I'
          is appropriate. This leads to system names like "IB201".</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>User Name</strong> - The User Name of the Block. The User Name of a Block
          created here may be set to any text. The User Name for a Block created by Layout Editor
          is set by Layout Editor and should not be changed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Value</strong> - This is the string value of whatever object the Block is
          carrying. Usually, this will either be a message or a Throttle object. If you modify
          this, it's stored in the Block as a string. There is currently no way to manually add a
          Throttle object to a Block from the table. <a href=
          "../../../../html/tools/tracker/index.shtml">More information on Block tracking</a></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Comment</strong> - You may enter any text in this field that will help you
          distinguish this Block from other Blocks, or provide useful notes about its use.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Delete</strong> - Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button in any row to
          delete the Block in that row from the list of Blocks in the program. You must save your
          configuration (and any Panels present) to disk to make the deletion permanent. Deletion
          can not be undone. <strong>Caution: Make sure you remove all references to a Block before
          deleting it. JMRI will show a warning if you haven't done so.</strong> Blocks are
          referenced in the Paths of other Blocks, in some scripts, and in Layout Editor
          Panels.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Direction</strong> - The current direction stored in the Block.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Length</strong> (optional) - Displays the length of the Block. Optionally, you
          may enter the length of the Block here. The length is used for automatic running of
          trains. If '0.0' is displayed, the length has not yet been entered. The entered length
          should be the actual length of the Block on the model railroad layout. Length is entered
          and displayed in either inches or centimeters, depending on which unit is requested at
          the bottom of the Block Table pane.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Curvature</strong> (optional) - Displays the Curvature selected for the track
          in the Block. Curvature is used for automatic running of trains, and need not be entered
          if trains will not be run automatically. Curvature, if present, indicates to the computer
          that it should slow the train as it runs through the Block. If <strong>None</strong> or
          <strong>Gradual</strong> is selected, an automatic train will proceed at normal speed.
          <strong>Tight</strong> should be selected if the train should slow down somewhat;
          <strong>Severe</strong> should be selected if the train should slow by a maximum amount.
          If the Block has variable curvature, your selection should be made according to the most
          limiting part of the Block.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>State</strong> Shows the current state of the block,</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Occupied</li>

            <li>UnOccupied</li>

            <li>Unknown</li>

            <li>Inconsistent</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Choose between textual and graphic display in the <a href=
          "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Display">Display preferences</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Reporter</strong> The Reporter assigned to this Block. See the <a href=
          "ReporterTable.shtml">Reporter Table</a>. Puts the Reporter Value into the Block
          value.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Use Current?</strong> If we consider the scenario whereby we want to track a
          train around the layout, typically this is achieved via the use of Memory objects
          associated with Blocks. Until the train is known, we have nothing to track. Typically, we
          can manually type the train ID into a pane and then this is tracked around the layout
          based on Block occupancy. If, however, we have an attached device that can provide us
          with the train ID, such as an RFID reader, we no longer need to manually type the train
          ID in - the reader does this for us. In essence, the reader is little more than an
          'intelligent' sensor - not only can it sense that 'something' is there, it can tell us
          which something it is.</p>

          <p>Now to the implementation. A Sensor is purely ACTIVE or INACTIVE - i.e. something is
          there or it isn't. A Reporter, however, can tell us one of the following:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>'Hey, I'm seeing something right now - this is it'</li>

            <li>'Hmm, I'm not seeing anything right now'</li>

            <li>'Hey, I saw something a while back - this was it'</li>

            <li>'Hmm, I've not seen anything yet'</li>
          </ol>
          The first two are from the CurrentReport; the last two from LastReport. At start-up
          (assuming there is nothing within the range of the reader), both 2 and 4 are the initial
          state. Once something is seen, both 1 and 3 return the same result. When the something is
          'out-of-range' 2 and 3 are then active. With 'Use Current?' selected, the Block value
          will switch between 1 and 2, whereas with 'Use Current?' unselected the Block value will
          switch between 3 and 4.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Permissive</strong> The Permissive option is used to identify Blocks that can
          be entered while the Block is occupied. This is used with certain automation tools and
          logic, to help determine if a train can enter an occupied Block and what Aspect should be
          displayed on a Signal Mast.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><a id="BlockSpeed"></a><strong>Block Speed</strong> The Block Speed is used with
          certain automation tools and logic, to help determine the speed at which a train can be
          set through the Block. It is also used by the Signal Mast Logic for determining which
          Aspect should be displayed in a signal path.</p>

          <p>In the drop down list, you are presented a set of named fixed speeds that have been
          predefined in the <code>signalSpeed.xml</code> file, in addition to a global option.<br>
          It is also possible to enter in a numerical value to represent a speed.</p>

          <p>The global value is set via the <strong>Speeds</strong> menu.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Block Table Controls</h2>
