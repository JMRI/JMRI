      <h1>The Block Table</h1>

      <p>Blocks may be set up manually in the Block Table, using a
      script, or automatically in a Layout Editor Panel. When a
      Block is defined in a Layout Editor Panel, a new Block is
      created if one does not already exist.</p>
      <p class="important">In Layout Editor, Blocks are identified
      by their <b>User Name</b>, so if a Block shown
      in the Block Table is used in a Layout Editor Panel, its User
      Name should not be changed here.<br>
      If you want to change the User Name of a Block used in a
      Layout Editor Panel, make the change in the Layout Editor,
      not in the Block Table.</p>

      <a name="blockPaths" id="blockPaths"></a>
      <h2>Blocks &amp; Paths</h2>
      <p>To complete the definition of a Block, Paths and Bean
      Settings must be attached to each Block.<br>
      <strong>Paths</strong> describe entry points
      to the Block. Each Block has one or more Paths associated
      with it. Sometimes a Turnout must be set a certain way to use
      a Path; Bean Settings carry that information. Paths and Bean
      Settings are set up automatically for Blocks defined in a
      Layout Editor Panel. They can also be set up in a script.
      There is currently no way to manually enter Paths or Bean
      Settings. Paths and Bean Settings are not shown in the Block
      Table, and are mentioned here only for completeness.</p>

      <p>For use in automatically running Trains, a Length
      attribute and a Curvature attribute may optionally be
      assigned to a Block. These optional attributes are entered
      manually in this Table. If Trains will not be run
      automatically through a Block, there is no need to add these
      attributes.</p>

      <h2>Columns in the Block Table</h2>
      (You may change the order of the columns by dragging their titles,
      and sort the rows by clicking one of the sort triangles next to a column title)
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>System Name</b> - The System Name of the Block.
          There is no functional requirement for a type letter in
          the System Name of a Block, but by convention we use 'B'
          for 'Block'. The default implementation is not
          system-specific, so a system letter of 'I' is
          appropriate. This leads to system names like "IB201".</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>User Name</b> - The User Name of the Block. The
          User Name of a Block created here may be set to any text.
          The User Name for a Block created by Layout Editor is set
          by Layout Editor and should not be changed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Value</b> - This is the string value of whatever
          object the Block is carrying. Usually, this will either
          be a message or a Throttle object. If you modify this,
          it's stored in the Block as a string. There is currently
          no way to manually add a Throttle object to a Block from
          the table. <a href=
          "../../../../html/tools/tracker/index.shtml">More
          information on Block tracking</a></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Comment</b> - You may enter any text in this field
          that will help you distinguish this Block from other
          Blocks, or provide useful notes about its use.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Delete</b> - Click the <b>Delete</b> button in any
          row to delete the Block in that row from the list of
          Blocks in the program. You must save your configuration
          (and any Panels present) to disk to make the deletion
          permanent. Deletion can not be undone. <b>Caution: Make
          sure you remove all references to a Block before deleting
          it. JMRI will show a warning if you haven't done so.</b>
          Blocks are referenced in the Paths of other Blocks, in
          some scripts, and in Layout Editor Panels.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Direction</b> - The current direction stored in the
          Block.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Length</b> (optional) - Displays the length of the
          Block. Optionally, you may enter the length of the Block
          here. The length is used for automatic running of trains.
          If '0.0' is displayed, the length has not yet been
          entered. The entered length should be the actual length
          of the Block on the model railroad layout. Length is
          entered and displayed in either inches or centimeters,
          depending on which unit is requested at the bottom of the
          Block Table pane.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Curvature</b> (optional) - Displays the Curvature
          selected for the track in the Block. Curvature is used
          for automatic running of trains, and need not be entered
          if trains will not be run automatically. Curvature, if
          present, indicates to the computer that it should slow
          the train as it runs through the Block. If <b>None</b> or
          <b>Gradual</b> is selected, an automatic train will
          proceed at normal speed. <b>Tight</b> should be selected
          if the train should slow down somewhat; <b>Severe</b>
          should be selected if the train should slow by a maximum
          amount. If the Block has variable curvature, your
          selection should be made according to the most limiting
          part of the Block.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>State</b> Shows the current state of the block,</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Occupied</li>
          <li>UnOccupied</li>          
          <li>Unknown</li>          
          <li>Inconsistent</li>          
          </ul>
          <p>Choose between textual and graphic display in the 
          <a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Display">Display preferences</a>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Reporter</b> The Reporter assigned to this Block.
          See the <a href="ReporterTable.shtml">Reporter Table</a>.
          Puts the Reporter Value into the Block value.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Use Current?</b> If we consider the scenario
          whereby we want to track a train around the layout,
          typically this is achieved via the use of Memory objects
          associated with Blocks. Until the train is known, we have
          nothing to track. Typically, we can manually type the
          train ID into a pane and then this is tracked around the
          layout based on Block occupancy. If, however, we have an
          attached device that can provide us with the train ID,
          such as an RFID reader, we no longer need to manually
          type the train ID in - the reader does this for us. In
          essence, the reader is little more than an 'intelligent'
          sensor - not only can it sense that 'something' is there,
          it can tell us which something it is.</p>

          <p>Now to the implementation. A Sensor is purely ACTIVE
          or INACTIVE - i.e. something is there or it isn't. A
          Reporter, however, can tell us one of the following:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>'Hey, I'm seeing something right now - this is
            it'</li>

            <li>'Hmm, I'm not seeing anything right now'</li>

            <li>'Hey, I saw something a while back - this was
            it'</li>

            <li>'Hmm, I've not seen anything yet'</li>
          </ol>The first two are from the CurrentReport; the last
          two from LastReport. At start-up (assuming there is
          nothing within the range of the reader), both 2 and 4 are
          the initial state. Once something is seen, both 1 and 3
          return the same result. When the something is
          'out-of-range' 2 and 3 are then active. With 'Use
          Current?' selected, the Block value will switch between 1
          and 2, whereas with 'Use Current?' unselected the Block
          value will switch between 3 and 4.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Permissive</b> The Permissive option is used to
          identify Blocks that can be entered while the Block is
          occupied. This is used with certain automation tools and
          logic, to help determine if a train can enter an occupied
          Block and what Aspect should be displayed on a Signal
          Mast.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><a name="BlockSpeed" id="BlockSpeed"></a><b>Block
          Speed</b> The Block Speed is used with certain automation
          tools and logic, to help determine the speed at which a
          train can be set through the Block. It is also used by
          the Signal Mast Logic for determining which Aspect should
          be displayed in a signal path.</p>

          <p>In the drop down list, you are presented a set of
          named fixed speeds that have been predefined in the
          <code>signalSpeed.xml</code> file, in addition to a
          global option.<br>
          It is also possible to enter in a numerical value to
          represent a speed.</p>

          <p>The global value is set via the <b>Speeds</b>
          menu.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Block Table Controls</h2>
      <p>Along the bottom of the Block Table pane are buttons
      that control its operation.</p>
