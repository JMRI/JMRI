<H1>The Block Table</H1>

<H2>Blocks:</H2>
<p>Blocks are sections of track whose occupancy may be individually monitored. Dividing 
track into Blocks is optional. Blocks set up in a track diagram normally correspond 
to physical blocks on a layout. Block occupancy is indicated by the state of an 
occupancy sensor. When a layout's track is divided into Blocks, all of the track need 
not belong to a Block. For example, yard track may not be in a Block, whereas mainline 
track almost always would be divided into Blocks. The main use of Blocks is to facilitate 
signaling, but Blocks may be used for other layout control and animation functions.</p>
<p>Blocks may be set up using a script, or automatically in a Layout Editor panel. When a 
Block is defined in a Layout Editor panel, a new Block is created if one does not already
exist.  In Layout Editor, Blocks are identified by their User Name, so if a Block shown 
in this table is used in a Layout Editor panel, its User Name should not be changed. If 
you want to change the User Name of a Block used in a Layout Editor panel, make the 
change in the Layout Editor, not here.</p>
<p>To complete the definition of a Block, Paths and Bean Settings must be attached to 
each Block. Paths describe entry points to the Block. Each Block has one or more Paths
associated with it. Sometimes a turnout must be set a certain way to use a Path; Bean 
Settings carry that information. Paths and Bean Settings are set up automatically for 
Blocks defined in a Layout Editor panel. They can also be set up in a script. There is 
currently no way to manually enter Paths or Bean Settings. Paths and Bean Settings are 
not shown in the Block Table, and are described here only for completeness.</p>
<p>For use in automatically running trains, a length attribute and a curvature attribute 
may optionally be assigned to a Block. These optional attributes are entered manually 
in this table. If trains will not be run automatically through 
a Block, there is no need to add these attributes.</p>
<H2>Columns in the Block Table:</H2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>System Name</b> - The system name of the Block. There is no functional 
requirement for a type letter in the System Name of a Block, but by convention we use 
'B' for 'Block'. The default implementation is not system-specific, so a system letter 
of 'I' is appropriate. This leads to system names like "IB201".</p></li> 

<li><p><b>User Name</b> - The user name of the Block. The user name of a Block created
here may be set to any text.  The user name for a Block created by Layout Editor is 
set by Layout Editor and should not be changed.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Value</b> - This is the string value of whatever object the
block is carrying.  Usually, this will either be a message
or a Throttle object. If you modify this, it's stored in the Block
as a string. There is currently no way to manually add a Throttle
object to a block from the table.

<li><p><b>Comment</b> - You may enter any text in this field that will help you 
distinguish this Block from other Blocks, or provide useful notes about its use.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Delete</b> - Click the <b>Delete</b> button in any row to delete the Block in 
that row from the list of Blocks in the computer. You must save your configuration (and 
any Panels present) to disk to make the deletion permanent. Deletion may not be undone.
<b>Caution: Make sure you remove all references to a Block before deleting it.</b>  
Blocks are referenced in the Paths of other Blocks, in some scripts, and in Layout 
Editor panels.<p></li> 

<li><p><b>Direction</b> - The current direction stored in the block.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Length</b> (optional) - Displays the length of the Block.  Optionally, you may 
enter the length of the Block here.  The length is used for automatic running of trains. 
If '0.0' is displayed, the length has not been entered. The entered length should be the 
actual length of the Block on the model railroad layout. Length is entered and displayed 
in either inches or centimeters, depending on which unit is requested at the bottom of 
the Block Table.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Curvature</b> (optional) - Displays the curvature selected for the track in 
the Block. Curvature is used for automatic running of trains, and need not be entered 
if trains will not be run automatically. Curvature, if present, indicates to the computer 
that it should slow the train as it runs through the Block. If <b>None</b> or 
<b>Gradual</b> are selected, an automatic train will proceed at normal speed. <b>Tight</b> 
should be selected if the train should slow down some; <b>Severe </b>should be selected 
if the train should slow by a maximum amount. If the Block has variable curvature, your 
selection should be made according to the most limiting part of the Block.</p></li>

<li><p><b>State</b>
Shows the current state of the block, Occupied or UnOccupied


<li><p><b>Reporter</b>
The Reporter assigned to this block. See the Reporter table. Puts the Reporter Value into 
the Block value

<li><p><b>Use Current?</b>
If we consider the scenario whereby we want track a train around the layout, typically this 
is achieved via the use of Memory objects associated with Blocks. Until the train is known, we 
have nothing to track. Typically, we can manually type in the train ID into a panel and then 
this is tracked around the layout based on block occupancy. If, however, we have an attached 
device that can provide us with the train ID, such as an RFID reader, we no longer need to 
manually type the train ID in - the reader does this for us. In essence, the reader is little 
more than an 'intelligent' sensor - not only can it sense that 'something' is there, it can 
tell us which something it is.
Now to the implementation.
A Sensor is purely ACTIVE or INACTIVE - i.e. something is there or it isn't.
A Reporter, however, can tell us one of the following;
1. 'Hey, I'm seeing something right now - this is it'
2. 'Hmm, I'm not seeing anything right now'
3. 'Hey, I saw something a while back - this was it'
4. 'Hmm, I've not seen anything yet'
The first two are from the CurrentReport; the last two from LastReport.
At start-up (assuming there is nothing within the range of the reader), both 2 and 4 are the initial 
state. Once something is seen, both 1 and 3 return the same result. 
When the something is 'out-of-range' 2 and 3 are then active.
With 'Use Current?' selected the Block value will switch between 1 and 2, 
whereas with 'Use Current?' unselected the Block value will switch between 3 and 4.

<li><p><b>Permissive</b>
The permissive option is used to identify blocks that can be entered while the 
block is occupied.  It is used with certain automation tools and logic, to help
determine if a train can enter an occupied block and what aspect should be displayed
on a signal mast.</li>

<li><p><b>Block Speed</b>
The speed is used with certain automation tools and logic, to help
determine the speed at which a train can be set through the block.
It is also used by the signal mast logic for determining which aspect should
be displayed in a signal path.
<P>In the drop down list, you are presented a set of named fixed speeds that
have been predefined in the signalSpeed.xml file, in addition to a global option.  
<br>It is also possible to enter in a numerical value to represent a speed.
<p>The global value is set via the <b>Speeds</b> menu option.</p></li>
