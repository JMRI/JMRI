<H1>Adding/Editing Logix</H1>
	<p>In the Add Logix window, entering a system name and a user name, then clicking 
	<b>Create Logix</b>, will create a new Logix, and bring up the Edit Logix 
	window. A user name may be any useful text, provided the new user name was 
	not previously assigned to another Logix. Once a Logix is created, its system 
	name cannot be changed. Its user name may be changed in either the 
	Logix Table or the Edit Logix window. The user name is usually used to identify 
	the particular Logix, for example, "Signal 5 Control".</p>
	<p>The system name for a Logix always must begin with the two letters IX, 
	usually followed by a number selected by the user.  For example, valid Logix 
	system names include: IX1, IX34, and IX100. All letters in a system name must 
	be in upper case. If the user enters lower case letters, JMRI will automatically
	convert them to upper case. Also, as a convenience to the user, if the 
	entered system name does not begin with IX, the program will add IX in 
	front of what is entered. For example, to enter a system name of IX32, simply 
	enter 32 in the system name field, and the program will do the rest.</p>
	<p>The Edit Logix window allows Conditionals to be created and edited. The 
	system name and user name of the Logix are displayed at the top. The user name 
	may be changed by entering/modifying the text in the User Name field. Next is a 
	table of Conditionals belonging to the Logix. To add a new Conditional, click 
	the <b>New Conditional</b> button under the Conditionals table.  
	(See also the 
	<a href="ConditionalAddEdit.shtml">seperate help page on adding/editing Conditionals</a>)
	This will 
	create a new Conditional (a new row in the Conditionals table),
	and open the Edit Conditional window allowing the logical expression and
	actions of the new Conditional to be defined.  An existing Conditional may be 
	edited by clicking the <b>Edit</b> button of that Conditional in the 
	table.  The user name of the Conditional may be changed in the table. Conditional 
	user names may be any useful text, provided the new user name is not used by 
	another Conditional belonging to this Logix. It may be the same as the user name
	of another Logix's Conditional. <b>When editing the user name (or any item in 
	any JMRI table) please remember to move to another cell in the table so that 
	the program is notified that you have finished your entry, otherwise the entry 
	may not take effect.</b></p> 
	<P>Clicking <b>Calculate</b> under the conditionals table causes all 
	Conditionals of the Logix to be calculated. Resulting states are displayed in 
	the State column of the table. Since the Logix is "inactive" while being edited, 
	no Conditional actions are taken when the <b>Calculate</b> button is pressed.  
	</p>
        <p>The order of Conditionals in the Conditionals table may be changed
	by clicking <b>Reorder</b> (below the Conditionals table). Clicking
	<b>Reorder</b> changes all edit buttons in the last Column of the table to 
	<b>First</b>. Select the Conditional that is to be first, and it
	is immediately moved to the top of the table. All remaining buttons change
	to <b>Next</b>. Select remaining Conditionals in desired order, until
	all buttons change back to <B>Edit</b>. Note that the order that
	Conditionals are listed in the Logix does not determine the order
	in which they're evaluated, nor does it force evaluation
	of one Conditional when an earlier or later one is evaluated.
	For more on this, see the discussion on the 
	<A href="../../../../html/tools/Logix.shtml">Logix main page</a>.
	<p> When <b>Done</b> is clicked at the bottom of the Edit Logix window, any 
	change in the Logix user name is checked and made. A check is made for
	inconsistencies in specifying that an entity (sensor, turnout, etc.) referenced
	in multiple state variables is not monitored as a trigger for calculation of 
	the Logix, and a warning 
	message appears if any inconsistencies are found. Then the Logix is activated, 
	the Edit Logix window is dismissed, and the user is returned to the Logix
	Table. Immediately before the Logix is activated, the state of all its 
	Conditionals is set to UNKNOWN. Immediately after activation, all 
	Conditionals are calculated.</p>
	<p>The Edit Logix window also provides a way to delete a Logix if it is no 
	longer needed. Click <b>Delete Logix</b> to delete the Logix being edited 
	and all its Conditionals. </p>
