      <h1>Adding/Editing Logix</h1>

      <p>In the Add Logix window, entering a system name and a user
      name, then clicking <strong>Create Logix</strong>, will create a new
      Logix, and bring up the Edit Logix window. A user name may be
      any useful text, provided the new user name was not
      previously assigned to another Logix. Once a Logix is
      created, its system name cannot be changed. Its user name may
      be changed in either the Logix Table or the Edit Logix
      window. The user name is usually used to identify the
      particular Logix, for example, "Signal 5 Control".</p>

      <p>The system name for a Logix always must begin with the two
      letters <strong>IX</strong>, usually followed by a number selected
      by the user. For example, valid Logix system names include: IX1,
      IX34, and IX100. All letters in a system name must be in
      upper case. If the user enters lower case letters, JMRI will
      automatically convert them to upper case. Also, as a
      convenience to the user, if the entered system name does not
      begin with IX, the program will add IX in front of what is
      entered. For example, to enter a system name of IX32, simply
      enter 32 in the system name field, and the program will do
      the rest.</p>

      <p>The Edit Logix pane allows Conditionals to be created
      and edited. The system name and user name of the Logix are
      displayed at the top. The user name may be changed by
      entering/modifying the text in the User Name field. Next is a
      table of Conditionals belonging to the Logix. To add a new
      Conditional, click the <strong>New Conditional</strong> button under
      the Conditional Table. (See also the <a href=
      "ConditionalAddEdit.shtml">separate help page on
      adding/editing Conditionals</a>) This will create a new
      Conditional (a new row in the Conditional Table), and open
      the Edit Conditional pane allowing the logical expression
      and actions of the new Conditional to be defined. An existing
      Conditional may be edited by clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> button
      of that Conditional in the table. The user name of the
      Conditional may be changed in the table. Conditional user
      names may be any useful text, provided the new user name is
      not used by another Conditional belonging to this Logix. It
      may be the same as the user name of another Logix's
      Conditional. <em>When editing the user name (or any item in    
      any JMRI table) please remember to move to another cell in
      the table so that the program is notified that you have
      finished your entry, otherwise the entry may not take
      effect.</em></p>

      <p>Clicking <strong>Calculate</strong> under the Conditional Table
      causes all Conditionals of the Logix to be calculated.
      Resulting states are displayed in the State column of the
      table. Since the Logix is "inactive" while being edited, no
      Conditional actions are taken when the <strong>Calculate</strong>
      button is pressed.</p>

      <p>The order of Conditionals in the Conditional Table may be
      changed by clicking <strong>Reorder</strong> (below the Conditional
      Table). Clicking <strong>Reorder</strong> changes all edit buttons in
      the last Column of the table to <strong>First</strong>. Select the
      Conditional that is to be first, and it is immediately moved
      to the top of the table. All remaining buttons change to
      <strong>Next</strong>. Select remaining Conditionals in desired order,
      until all buttons change back to <strong>Edit</strong>. Note that the
      order that Conditionals are listed in the Logix does not
      determine the order in which they're evaluated, nor does it
      force evaluation of one Conditional when an earlier or later
      one is evaluated. For more on this, see the discussion on the
      <a href="../../../../html/tools/Logix.shtml">Logix main
      page</a>.</p>

      <p>When <strong>Done</strong> is clicked at the bottom of the Edit
      Logix window, any change in the Logix user name is checked
      and made. A check is made for inconsistencies in specifying
      that an entity (sensor, turnout, etc.) referenced in multiple
      state variables is not monitored as a trigger for calculation
      of the Logix, and a warning message appears if any
      inconsistencies are found. Then the Logix is activated, the
      Edit Logix window is dismissed, and the user is returned to
      the Logix Table. Immediately before the Logix is activated,
      the state of all its Conditionals is set to UNKNOWN.
      Immediately after activation, all Conditionals are
      calculated.</p>

      <p>The Edit Logix window also provides a way to delete a
      Logix if it is no longer needed. Click <strong>Delete Logix</strong> to
      delete the Logix being edited and all its Conditionals.</p>
