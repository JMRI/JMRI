      <h1>Adding/Editing Transits</h1>

      <a name="addTransit" id="addTransit"></a>
      <h2>Adding a new Transit</h2>To add a new Transit, follow
      this procedure:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click <strong><a href="TransitTable.shtml">Transits</a></strong>
          in the <strong>Tables</strong> submenu of the <strong>Tools</strong> menu to
          bring up the Transit Table, and click the <strong>Add...</strong>
          button at the bottom of the table to bring up the
          Add/Edit Transit window.</p><img src=
          "images/TransitAddFrame.png" width="819" height="776" alt="Transit frame">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Choose from:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Checking <strong>Automatically Generate System Name</strong>
            will allow the program to automatically generate a
            <strong>System Name</strong> for you. The created name will be
            IZ:AUTO:nnnn, where nnnn is the next available number.</li>

            <li>Uncheck <strong>Automatically Generate System Name</strong>,
            and enter a <strong>System Name</strong>, according to the JMRI
            convention. Since Transits are internal objects, the
            first letter should be "I" (for Internal). The second
            letter should be "Z" to indicate a Transit. This is
            usually followed by a number, but the program will
            accept any numeric or alphabetic characters. The system
            name must be different from the System Name of other
            Transits. If the name you enter does not begin with
            "IZ", the program will insert an "IZ" ahead of whatever
            you enter, so you can simply enter a number if you
            prefer.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter a <strong>User Name</strong>. Any string of characters
          that is different from the User Name of other Transits
          will be accepted, but it's wise to use a string that
          describes the intended use of the Transit.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Next add <strong>Sections</strong> to the Transit. Every Transit
          must have at least two Sections, but most will have many
          more. Two "Primary" Sections are needed to define the
          direction of the Transit.<br>
          <a href="SectionTable.shtml">Sections</a> must be connected, and
          must be entered in order. Select the Section you would
          like to begin the Transit in the upper popup menu. At any
          point during Section addition, this popup menu lists only
          those Sections that are eligible for addition.</p>

          <p>If applicable, check <strong>Section is Safe</strong> to add the next
          Section with the Safe checkbox selected.<br>
          Safe Sections allow auto-assigned Trains to safely halt during
          a Transit without blocking a Transit for an opposing Train.
          For example:<br>
          <img src=
          "images/TransitSafeSections.png" width="1113" height="240" alt="Safe sections example"><br>
          Once Train Amtrak 139 leaves the upper block of the
          interlocking at Manion, it reaches the next Safe Section.<br>
          You would set up The transit for this Train as follows:<br>
          <img src=
          "images/TransitEditSafe.png" width="819" height="565" alt="Safe sections"><br>(for
          more on Safe see the
          <a href="../dispatcher/NewTrain.shtml#allocateOptions">Activate
          New Train</a> Help)
          <br>
          Click <strong>Add Next Section</strong> to add the first Section of
          the Transit.</p>

          <p>The <strong>Pause Allocation on Sensor</strong> option can be used to
          assign a sensor that when Active will stop allocating sections.  This can
          also be set later by changing the appropriate row in the section list.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Add more primary Sections in the same manner. Select
          the Section to be added in the popup menu, and click
          <strong>Add Next Section</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Immediately after entering a Section using <strong>Add Next
          Section</strong>, if you would like to add an <strong>Alternate
          Section</strong> to the one just entered, select an alternate
          Section from the popup menu to the left of the <strong>Add
          Alternate Section</strong> button. If there are no possibly
          valid Alternate Sections, the popup menu will be empty.
          Often the popup menu will contain possible Alternate
          Sections that are not really alternates to the primary
          Section. For a listed alternate Section to be a
          <em>valid</em> Alternate Section, it must connect to the
          next primary Section.<br>
          <strong>It is your responsibility to determine whether a
          Section listed in the popup menu is a valid alternate
          Section</strong>, i.e. will connect to the
          next primary Section.<br>
          For more information on alternate
          Sections and their use, refer to the <a href=
          "../../../../html/tools/Transits.shtml">Transit Documentation</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you decide you need to add a Section at the
          beginning of the Transit, select a Section in the popup
          menu to the left of the <strong>Insert As First Section</strong>
          button, then press the <strong>Insert As First Section</strong>
          button. The selected Section will become the first
          Section in the Transit, with order number "1", and the
          order numbers of all other Sections will be incremented.
          The popup menu will be empty if there are no possible
          Sections to add at the beginning of the Transit.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The next set of buttons provide options to aid in
          setting up or editing a Transit.</p>

          <div style="margin-left: 2em">
            <p>If at any time you decide you want to start over,
            click <strong>Remove Sections from Transit</strong> to clear the
            table of Sections, and return to step 4 above.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Remove Last Section</strong> and <strong>Remove First
            Section</strong> buttons delete a Section at the end or
            beginning of the Transit, and adjust order numbers of
            the remaining Sections. Primary Sections in the middle
            of the Transit may not be deleted because doing so
            would break the connectivity of Sections within the
            Transit.</p>

            <p>The remaining three editing buttons provide for
            replacing a primary Section and deleting or adding an
            alternate Section in the middle of the Transit. To use
            these buttons, in the center of the pane set the order
            number of the Section to
            be edited, then press one of the buttons -- <strong>Replace
            Primary for Order</strong>, <strong>Delete Alternate For
            Order</strong>, or <strong>Add Alternate For Order</strong>. If no
            Sections are available that meet the requirements, a
            message will appear, and no changes will be made. If
            only one Section satisfies the requirements, the edit
            is immediately performed. If more than one Section
            satisfies the requirements, a dialog is presented so a
            choice of Section may be made. When a primary Section
            is replaced, its Actions (see below) are preserved.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you will be using this Transit to run an automatic
          Train, click the <strong>View/Add/Edit Actions</strong> button to
          set up any <strong>Action</strong> needed when a train is in the
          specified Section.</p>
          <a href="ViewSpecialActions.shtml"><img src=
          "images/ViewActionsButton.png" height="101" width="340" alt="Transit actions button"></a>
          <p>You can add Actions now, or you can
          edit this Transit at a later time to set up Actions. More
          information is provided in the <a href=
          "ViewSpecialActions.shtml">View Actions help</a>. It
          is usually better to set up all Sections before adding
          Actions, because when a Section is deleted from the
          Transit, its Actions are also deleted.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Click the <strong>Create</strong> button at the bottom of the
          window. If everything is fine, the window will close and
          a new Transit will appear in the Transit Table. If there
          is trouble with anything, a message will be displayed
          indicating the error and what you should do to fix it.
          Correct the error and click <strong>Create</strong> again.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Note: The <strong>Direction</strong> and <strong>Alternate</strong> columns in
      the Add/Edit Transit Table are for information only. They are
      set automatically as you build the Transit. The Direction
      column indicates the direction of travel through the Section,
      and the Alternate column indicates whether the Section is the
      <em>Primary</em> Section for this order number or an
      <em>Alternate</em> Section.</p>

      <h2>Editing an existing Transit</h2>To edit an existing
      Transit, follow this procedure:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click a Transit's <strong>Edit</strong> button in the <a href=
          "TransitTable.shtml">Transit Table</a> to bring up the
          Add/Edit Transit window. The window will be the same as
          that shown above, except the System Name will be fixed,
          and the <strong>Create</strong> button will be replaced with an
          <strong>Update</strong> Button.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Make whatever changes or additions you need to the
          information in the window. Note that the System Name of
          the edited Transit may not be changed, but the User Name
          may be changed. Items that may be edited are described
          <a href="#addTransit">above</a> in steps 3 through 9 in
          the procedure for adding a new Transit.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>After making changes to the Transit information, click
          <strong>Update</strong> to change the selected Transit. If
          everything is fine, the window will close. If there is
          any trouble, a message will be displayed indicating the
          error and what you should do to fix it. Correct the error
          and click <strong>Update</strong> again.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Click <strong>Cancel</strong> to exit without changing the
        selected Transit. If the Add/Edit Transit window is
        dismissed (closed) while editing, <strong>Cancel</strong> is
        automatically selected, and no changes are made to the
        selected Transit.</li>
