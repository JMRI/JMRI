<H1>Adding/Editing Transits</H1>
    
<a name="addTransit">
<H2>Adding a new Transit</H2></a>
To add a new Transit, follow this procedure:
<ol>
<li><p>Click <b><a href="TransitTable.shtml">Transits</a></b> in the 
<b>Tables</b> submenu of the <b>Tools</b> menu to bring up
the Transit Table, and click the <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom of the 
table to bring up the Add/Edit Transit window.</p>
<img src="TransitAddFrame.jpg" height="550" width="770">
<li><p>Do either:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Allow the program to automatically generate a <b>System Name</b> for you.
	The created name will be IZnn, where nn is the next available number.</li>
	<li>Uncheck <b>Automatically Generate System Name</b>, and enter a <b>System Name</b>,
	according to the JMRI convention. Since Transits are internal objects, the first 
	letter should be "I" (for internal). The second letter should be "Z" to indicate a 
	Transit. This is usually followed by a number, but the program will accept any 
	numeric or alphabetic characters. The system name must be different from the System 
	Name of other Transits.  If the name you enter does not begin with "IZ", the program
	will insert an "IZ" ahead of whatever you enter, so you can simply enter a number if 
	you prefer. </li>
</ul>
<li><p>Enter a <b>User Name</b>. Any string of characters that is different 
from the User Name of other Transits will be accepted, but it's 
wise to use a string that describes the intended use of the Transit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next add <b>Sections</b> to the Transit.  Every Transit must have at least 
two Sections, but most will have many more. Two "Primary" Sections are needed to 
define the direction of the Transit. Sections must be connected, and must 
be entered in order. Select the Section you would like to begin the Transit 
in the upper popup menu. At any point during Section addition, this popup menu lists 
only those Sections that are eligible for addition. Click <b>Add Next Section</b> 
to add the first Section of the Transit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add more primary Sections in the same manner. Select the 
Section to be added in the popup menu, and click <b>Add Next Section</b>.
</li>
<li><p>Immediately after entering a Section using <b>Add Next Section</b>, if 
you would like to add an <b>Alternate Section</b> to the one just entered, select 
an alternate Section from the popup menu to the left of the <b>Add Alternate 
Section</b> button. If there are no possibly valid alternate Sections, the popup 
menu will be empty. Often the popup menu will contain possible alternate 
Sections that are not really alternates to the primary Section. For a listed 
alternate Section to be a <i>valid</i> alternate Section, it must connect to 
the next primary Section. <b>It is your responsibility to determine whether a 
Section listed in the popup menu is a valid alternate Section</b>, i.e. 
will connect to the next primary Section. For more information on alternate 
Sections and their use, refer to the 
<a href="TransitTable.shtml">Transit Table help file</a>.
</li>
<li><p>If you decide you need to add a Section at the beginning of the Transit, 
select a Section in the popup menu to the left of the <b>Insert As First Section</b>
button, then press the <b>Insert As First Section</b> button. The selected Section 
will become the first Section in the Transit, with order number "1", and the order 
numbers of all other Sections will be incremented. The popup menu will be empty if 
there are no possible Sections to add at the beginning of the Transit.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>The next set of buttons provide options to aid in setting up or editting a 
Transit.</p>
<ol>
<p>If at any time you decide you want to start over, click <b>Delete All 
Sections</b> to clear the table of Sections, and return to step 4 above.</p>
<p>The <b>Remove Last Section</b> and <b>Remove First Section</b> buttons delete 
a Section at the end or beginning of the Transit, and adjust order numbers of 
the remaining Sections. Primary Sections in the middle of the Transit may not be 
deleted because doing so would break the connectivity of Sections within the 
Transit.</p>
<p> The remaining three editting buttons provide for replacing a primary Section and 
deleting or adding an alternate Section in the middle of the Transit. To use 
these buttons, enter the order number of the Section to be editted, then press 
one of the buttons--<b>Replace Primary for Order</b>, <b>Delete Alternate For Order</b>, 
or <b>Add Alternate For Order</b>. If no Sections are available that meet the 
requirements, a message will appear, and no changes will be made. If only one 
Section satisfies the requirements, the edit is immediately performed. If more 
than one Section satisfies the requirements, a dialog is presented so a choice 
of Section may be made. When a primary Section is replaced, its Actions (see 
below) are preserved.</p>
</ol>
<li><p>If you will be using this Transit to run an automatic train, click the 
<b>View/Add/Edit Actions</b> button to set up any <b>Action</b> needed 
when a train is in the specified Section. You can add Actions now, or 
you can edit this Transit at a later time to set up Actions.
More information is provided in the <a href="ViewSpecialActions.shtml">
View Actions help file</a>. It is usually better to set up all Sections before 
adding Actions, because when a Section is deleted from the Transit, its Actions 
are also deleted.</p>
</li>
</li><li><p>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the window.  
If everything is fine, the window will close and a new Transit will appear in 
the Transit Table. If there is trouble with anything, a message will be 
displayed indicating the error and what you should do to fix it. 
Correct the error and click <b>Create</b> again.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: The <b>Direction</b> and <b>Alternate</b> columns in the Add/Edit 
Transit table are for information only. They are set automatically as you 
build the Transit. The Direction column indicates the direction of travel 
through the Section, and the Alternate column indicates whether the Section 
is the <i>primary</i> Section for this order number or an <i>alternate</i> 
Section.</p>

<h2>Editing an existing Transit</h2>
To edit an existing Transit, follow  this procedure:
<ol>
<li><p>Click a Transit's <b>Edit</b> button in the <a href="TransitTable.shtml">
Transit Table</a> to bring up the Add/Edit Transit window. The window will 
be the same as that shown above, except the System Name will be fixed, and 
the <b>Create</b> button will be replaced with an <b>Update</b> Button.</p>
<img src="TransitEditFrame.jpg" height="550" width="770"></li>
<li><p>Make whatever changes or additions you need to the information in
the window. Note that the System Name of the edited Transit may not be 
changed, but the User Name may be changed. Items that may be edited are described 
<A HREF="#addTransit">above</a> in steps 3 through 9 in the procedure for adding 
a new Transit.</p></li>
<li><p>After making changes to the Transit information, click <b>Update</b> 
to change the selected Transit.  If everything is fine, the window will close.
If there is any trouble, a message will be displayed indicating the error and 
what you should do to fix it. Correct the error and click <b>Update</b> again.</p>
</li>
<li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit without changing the selected Transit. 
If the Add/Edit Transit window is dismissed (closed) while editing, <b>Cancel</b> 
is automatically selected, and no changes are made to the selected Transit.
</li>
</ol>
