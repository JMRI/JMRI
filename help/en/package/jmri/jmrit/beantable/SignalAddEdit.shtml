      <h1>Adding &amp; Editing Signal Heads</h1>

      <p>JMRI needs to know how a Signal Head on the layout is
      connected to the electrical hardware. Once JMRI knows that,
      it can send the right DCC commands to control the Appearance
      of a Signal Head.</p>

      <p>The "Edit Signal Head" panel provides for viewing and
      changing optional information for existing Signal Heads. Use
      the "Edit" button in the Signal Head Table to open a dialog
      for that Signal Head. Only one Signal Head may be edited at a
      time. Signal Type and Signal System may not be changed once
      they have been created. After making changes in the dialog,
      click the "Update" button at the bottom of the panel to
      change Signal Head information. Click "Cancel" to exit
      without making any changes. Closing the Edit Signal Head
      panel is equivalent to clicking "Cancel".</p>

      <p>The "Add New Signal" dialog that is opened by clicking on
      the "Add..." button at the bottom of the Signal Head Table
      lets you choose a Signal Head Connection type from the
      following list.</p>

      <h2>Available Signal Head Connection Types</h2>

        don't have a real one on the layout.</dd>

        <dt>DCC Signal Decoder</dt>

        <dd>
          This type controls Signal Heads attached to a decoder
          that uses the DCC signal packets defined by the <a href=
          "http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/DCCHome.html">NMRA DCC
          Working Group</a> for control. (You might be able to find
          information on those DCC packets on page 9 at <a href=
          "http://www.nmra.org/sites/default/files/s-9.2.1_2012_07.pdf">
          this link</a>; the NMRA web site is difficult to link
          into, so if that doesn't work, search for "NMRA 9.2.1
          Extended Accessory Decoder Control Packet Format"). This
          is a special protocol defined for driving Signal Heads,
          and is different from how "accessory decoders" (e.g.
          Turnout outputs) are controlled.

          <p>Enter the DCC address as a number. The Offset Address
          check box uses an alternative interpretation of the
          addressing scheme that might be in use.<br>
          <!-- from JMRI user group 5/4/2014 thanks to Suzie Tall and Ken Cameron-->
           Each possible Appearance of the Signal Head is assigned
          a different number; from here you can assign different
          numbers for each Aspect to suit the hardware being
          used.<br>
          The <a href=
          "http://www.teamdigital1.com/prod_catalogue/shd2_product/shd2.html">
          Team Digital SHD2</a> Signal Decoder is a Signal Head
          decoder using a different address for each Signal Head. A
          Signal Mast attached to the SHD2 must be configured as
          one or more Signal Head controlled masts using the DCC
          Signal connection type. Instructions can be found on the
          Team Digital website under the <a href=
          "http://www.teamdigital1.com/applications/shd2_apps/shd2_jmri_application.html">
          Applications &gt; SHD2</a> menu.<br>
          Note: The Signalist SC1 can also be configured as
          individual Signal Heads (searchlight with bicolor,
          tricolor or RGB LEDs or multi-lamp with individual LEDs),
          but is much easier to use when configured as a complete
          Signal Mast with all Signal Heads on a single DCC address
          using the <a href="signalmasttable.shtml#dccsmd">DCC
          Signal Mast driver</a>. In that case you don't need to
          add Signal Heads for your signal. Key difference between
          a Signal Head and a Signal Mast is the number of
          different states each might have. A Signal Head only has
          (up to) 8 Appearance entries, but a Signal Mast can have
          up to 32 (0-31) possible states, called Aspects in that
          case. The command going out is the same but the number of
          <em>possible</em> values differs.</p>

        <dt>Single Output</dt>

        <dd>
          This connection type controls a Signal Head with one
          output. A Signal Head connection that uses just one
          output line to indicate up to 2 Appearances plus
          Flashing. You can select 2 Appearances from the following
          list: Dark, Red, Yellow, Green and Lunar. The output
          coding is such that a Turnout status <em>Thrown</em> (On)
          controls one Appearance and <em>Closed</em> (Off)
          controls the other. Flashing allows for a third
          appearance, which will flash between the two Appearances
          configured. The connection can be to a single lamp/LED to
          display a single appearance. An alternative method is to
          connect a pair of LEDs to the single output wired up so
          that when the output of the decoder is On you get one
          color and while the output is Off you get the other. This
          type could also be used to control mechanically operated
          Signals that only have two Appearances and therefore
          always have an Appearance. It is possible to gain a third
          "Flashing" Appearance. If you have Dark and a color
          selected, then the end result is an additional Flash
          color option. If two colors have been selected, you are
          given a Flash option for both colors but this will result
          in the colors flashing alternatively. These connections
          are controlled via the JMRI Turnout logic, and therefore
          appear in the Turnout Table. They're not connected to
          switch motors, though, they're just electrical outputs.

          <p>For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
          Turnout for the electrical connection on the layout,
          either from the drop down list of already-defined
          Turnouts or by creating a new Turnout for a particular
          connection.</p>

          <p>Select one of the listed Appearances for both:<br>
          Appearance when Thrown - The appearance displayed when
          the connection is in the Thrown State.<br>
          Appearance when Closed - The appearance displayed when
          the connection is in the Closed State.</p>

        <dt>Double Output</dt>

        <dd>
          This type controls a Signal Head via two electrical
          connections. One goes to a green lamp/LED, and the other
          to a red one. Yellow is created by turning them both on
          at the same time.

          <p>For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
          turnout for the electrical connection on the layout,
          either from the drop down list of already-defined
          turnouts or by creating a new turnout for a particular
          connection. They need not be consecutive or in any
          particular order.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Double Output Head</dt>

        <dd>A Signal Head connection that uses just two output
        lines to indicate 4 signal Aspects.<br>
        Usually these Aspects will be Clear, Approach, Stop, and
        Dark. The output coding is such that one turnout Thrown
        (On) controls the Stop and the other Thrown (On) controls
        the Clear. Both outputs Thrown (On) controls the Approach,
        and both Closed (Off) is Dark. Each aspect change requires
        that two turnout commands be sent.</dd>

        <dt>Triple Output</dt>

        <dd>
          This type controls a Signal Head via three electrical
          connections. One goes to a green lamp/LED, one to a
          yellow lamp, and the third to a red one.<br>
          These connections are controlled via the JMRI Turnout
          logic, and therefore appear in the Turnout Table. They're
          not really connected to switch motors, though, they're
          just electrical outputs.

          <p>For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
          turnout for the electrical connection on the layout,
          either from the drop down list of already-defined
          turnouts or by creating a new turnout for a particular
          connection. They need not be consecutive or in any
          particular order.<br>
          If you need to debug one of these Signal Heads, start by
          checking whether the Turnout connections work.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Triple Output RGB</dt>

        <dd>
          This type controls a Signal Head via three outputs to
          indicate 5 signal Aspects. Usually these aspects will be
          Clear, Approach, Stop, Restricting and Dark.<br>
          The output coding is such that one Turnout Thrown (On)
          controls the Stop and another Thrown (On) controls the
          Clear. Both of these outputs Thrown (On) controls the
          Approach, all three On controls the Restricting, and all
          three Closed (Off) makes for Dark. Each Aspect change
          requires that three commands be sent.<br>
          The first connection drives a green lamp/LED, the second
          a red one, and the third to a blue one. They are
          controlled via the JMRI Turnout logic, and therefore
          appear in the Turnout Table. They're not connected to
          switch motors, though, they're just electrical outputs.

          <p>For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
          Turnout for the electrical connection on the layout,
          either from the drop down list of already-defined
          Turnouts or by creating a new Turnout for a particular
          connection. They need not be consecutive or in any
          particular order.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Quad (quadruple) Output</dt>

        <dd>
          This type controls a Signal Head via four electrical
          connections. One goes to a green lamp/LED, one to a
          yellow lamp, one to a red lamp, and the fourth to a
          "lunar" (white) one.<br>
          These connections are controlled via the JMRI Turnout
          logic, and therefore appear in the Turnout Table. They're
          not really connected to switch motors, though, they're
          just electrical outputs.

          <p>For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
          Turnout address for the electrical connection on the
          layout, either from the drop down list of already-defined
          turnouts or by creating a new turnout for a particular
          connection. They need not be consecutive or in any
          particular order.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>SE8C 4 Aspect</dt>

        <dd>
          The output is controlled by a single turnout command per
          Aspect change. One turnout command changes between "Stop"
          and "Clear", and the second turnout command changes
          between "Approach" and "Dark".

          <p>This type controls Signal Heads attached to a <a href=
          "http://www.digitrax.com">Digitrax</a> <a href=
          "http://www.digitrax.com/prd_statdec_se8c.php">SE8C
          signal driver card</a>.</p>

          <p>Because each SE8C 4 Aspect Signal Head works with a
          specific DCC address, its System Name is determined
          automatically from that address; you don't have to enter
          it. For example, the SE8C 4 Aspect Signal Head for
          hardware address 257 will be given a system name based on
          that. See page 5 through 7 of the <a href=
          "http://www.digitrax.com/static/apps/products/detection-signaling/se8c/documents/SE8C.pdf">
          Digitrax SE8C Manual</a>.</p>

          "images/Add_New_SE8C_Signal.png" align="right" height="153"
          width="131"></a> You can optionally enter a more readable
          User Name if you'd like.</p>

          <p>In the "Turnout number" box, enter the appropriate DCC
          address of the SE8C output as a number. For example, the
          1st signal head on the 1st SE8C, as configured from the
          Digitrax factory, is "257". Select "Create new", then
          select your layout connection (usually "LocoNet") in the
          drop down box, and enter "257" in the field next to it.
          Do the same in the second Turnout field, entering "258"
          as the second Signal Head address.</p>

          <p>For more advanced usages, for example if you're using
          more than one type of layout hardware, you can either
          select a Turnout from the drop down list of
          already-defined Turnouts or by creating a new Turnout for
          a particular connection.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>LDT LS-DEC</dt>

        <dd>
          This type is particularly useful for European signaling.
          It controls Signal Heads attached to a <a href=
          "http://www.ldt-infocenter.com/english/home_frame_e.htm">Littfinski
          DatenTechnik (LDT)</a> <a href=

          signal decoder</a>, or a <a href=
          "http://www.marathonmodel.cz/">Marathon Model</a> DP2N
          decoder.

          <p>These controllers use seven DCC Turnout (accessory
          decoder) addresses to specify the seven possible
          Appearances of the Signal Head. Enter those, either from
          the drop down list of already-defined Turnouts or by
          creating a new turnout for a particular connection. They
          need not be consecutive or in any particular order.<br>
          For more information on configuring these signals, see

        <dt>MERG Signal Driver</dt>

        <dd>
          This driver type controls a Signal that uses a MERG
          Signal Driver (SD2). An SD2 is connected to DCC using a
          steady state accessory decoder. The number of Aspects to
          be displayed on the Signal Mast, will determine the
          number of <a href="TurnoutAddEdit.shtml">Turnout</a>
          outputs required, ie.<br>
          2 Aspects: require 1 Turnout (pictured at right)<br>
          3 Aspects: require 2 Turnouts<br>
          4 Aspects: require 3 Turnouts

          <p>The MERG Signal driver in JMRI has been set up to
          control the SD2 Aspect output only. It does not control
          the other features of the SD2 such as "Steam Rules" or
          "Feather", however these can easily be configured using
          Logix or Routes.<br>
          <b>Notes</b> - The MERG SD2 driver does not support a
          Flashing yellow Aspect. For Flashing yellow Aspects an
          additional circuit is required as documented in the MERG
          Technical Bulletins.<br>
          As the MERG SD2 driver goes beyond the Green/Yellow/Red
          Aspects supported in JMRI with a Double yellow (yellow
          over yellow) aspect, the Double yellow state is
          represented in the status as a "Lunar".<br>
