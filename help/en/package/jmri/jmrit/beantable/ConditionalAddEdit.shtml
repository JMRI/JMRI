<H2>Adding/Editing Logix Conditionals</H2>
<P>The Edit Conditional window is where logical expressions are set
up and where actions are specified. The Edit Conditional window is
displayed when a Conditional is created, or when the <B>Edit</B> button
of a Conditional is pressed in the Edit Logix window. The Edit
Conditional window displays the system name and user name of the
Conditional at the top. The system name is automatically set by the
program and cannot be changed. The user name may be edited by
entering/modifying the text in the User Name field. The user name may
not be the same as the user name of another Conditional in this Logix,
but may be the same as the user name of a Conditional in a different
Logix.</P>
<P>Next are two sections--one for the setup of a logical expression
and one for set up of actions. Conditionals are statements of the form:

</P>
<UL>
	if (logical expression) then (action).
</UL>
A Conditional has two distinct parts: its "logical expression" and its
"action". The window has separate sections for set up of each.
<P></P>
<P>The logical expression section contains a table of state
variables, with two buttons below. Press the <B>Add State Variable</B>
to add a state variable (a row in the state variables table). The first
column in the state variables table displays an automatic AND when
appropriate. The second column contains a choice box that allows the
user to select the NOT operator as needed. The third column contains a
scrolling choice box, allowing selection of state variable type. Next
are three columns, Name, Data 1, and Data 2, that are used to provide
needed information for the selected variable type. When a variable type
is selected, N/A (for Not Applicable) is displayed in data entries that
are not needed to define the state variable, and a prompt message
telling what to enter in the remaining column(s) is displayed below the
table (above the two buttons). Available state variables are documented
<A HREF="#variable">below</A>. When a name is entered, it must
correspond to the system name or the user name of an existing entity
(sensor, turnout, light, etc.). It is useful to open the Sensor Table
when entering sensor names, or the Turnout Table to show available
turnouts, etc.</P>
<P><B>Caution:</B> If you use user names to specify state variables,
be very careful about changing these user names. User names may be
edited in JMRI, but changing user names without good reason can break
your state variable definitions. If you want to be able to freely change
your user names, specify state variables using system names, which
cannot be changed.</P>
<P>The Triggers Calculation column contains checkboxes that normally
are checked, so that a change in the state variable will trigger a
calculation of the Logix. For those rare cases where a change in a
specific entity (sensor, turnout, etc.) should not trigger a
calculation, you should uncheck the checkbox by clicking on it.
Unchecking the checkbox tells the program not to monitor that entity for
state changes. Note that if an entity occurs in more than one state
variable in any Conditional of the Logix, <B>all</B> state variables
where the specific entity occurs must be unchecked if a change in that
entity's state is not to trigger a calculation. If there are
inconsistencies (checked in some places, and unchecked in others) are
found when the Edit Logix window is closed, a warning is displayed.
Inconsistencies result in Logix calculation when the entity changes
state, which could produce unexpected behavior. So don't ignore the
warnings; fix the inconsistencies.</P>
<P>The last column of the table (<B>Delete</B> buttons) is used to
delete a state variable if you decide it is no longer needed. The State
column of the table shows the state (true or false) of each state
variable when it is evaluated. The state displayed includes the effect
of the NOT operator, if NOT is selected. For the logical expression, and
therefore the Conditional, to calculate true, all state variables must
evaluate to true.</P>
<P>At any time during the entry of state variable data, <B>Check
State Variables</B> may be clicked to check entered data and evaluate state
variables. When this button is pressed, checking and evaluation proceeds
until the check completes successfully, or an error is detected. If an
error is detected, checking stops for you to correct the error and click
<B>Check State Variables</B> again. <B>Please remember after editing
name and data items to click a different cell in the table before
clicking <B>Check State Variables</B> (or <B>Update Conditional</B> at
the bottom of the window) so that the program is notified that you have
finished your entry. Otherwise your entry may not take effect, and an
error may be reported unnecessarily.</B></P>
<P>The action section of the Edit Conditional window provides for
specifying up to two actions to be taken when a Conditional is
calculated. If either action is not needed, select "None" for type in
the scrollable selection box. Otherwise select an action type in the
type box, and data items needed to completely specify the action will
appear to the right of the type box. If you don't know what needs to be
entered in a data field, hover your cursor over it, and a hint message
will appear. When a name must be entered, the name must correspond to
the system name or the user name of an existing entity (sensor, turnout,
signal head, etc.) of the proper type. Opening the Sensor Table when
entering sensor names, or the Turnout Table to see available turnouts,
etc., may be useful. Available action types are described in detail <A
	HREF="#action">below</A>.</P>
<P><B>Caution:</B> If you use user names to specify actions, be very
careful about changing these user names. User names may be edited in
JMRI, but changing user names without good reason can break your action
definitions. If you want to be able to freely change your user names,
specify actions using system names, which cannot be changed.</P>
<P>For each action, three options are available for when to trigger
the action: 1) On Change to True, 2) On Change to False, and 3) On
Change. These refer to the calculated state of the Conditional, which is
equal to the value of the logical expression as specified in the state
variable table. One of these options must be selected. Click the radio
button next to an option to select it and deselect the other two.</P>
<P>When the logical expression and actions have been specified,
click <B>Update Conditional</B> at the bottom of the window. This
initiates a check of the logical expression (the same as done by <B>Check
State Variables</B>) and a check of entered data for actions. If the user
name has been edited, it is also checked. If an error is found, a
message box opens announcing the error, and the update is stopped to
allow you to correct the error and click <B>Update Conditional</B>
again. If no error is found, the Conditional is updated with the entered
data, the Edit Conditional window is closed, and the user is returned to
the Edit Logix window.</P>
<P>Two other buttons are available at the bottom of the Edit
Conditional window. Clicking <B>Cancel</B> will close the Edit
Conditional window without updating the Conditional. Clicking <B>Cancel</B>
results in loss of any data that has been entered. The other button, <B>Delete
Conditional</B>, provides an easy way to delete an unneeded Conditional.
Click <B>Delete Conditional</B> to delete the Conditional being edited
and return to the Edit Logix window.</P>

<P>Available state variables and actions are listed below. For more
information, consult the Logix documentation on the JMRI web page
http://jmri.sourceforge.net/ .</P>

<DT CLASS="left"><A NAME="variable">
<H3>Available State Variables</H3>
</A></DT>

<P>State variables that are currently available for use in
Conditionals are listed below, along with information on each. State
variables must always evaluate to either true or false. The condition
resulting in true is given for each. If the condition is not met, the
state variable evaluates to false. When a Logix is active, the states of
entities (sensor, turnout, light, etc.) specified in state variables in
its Conditionals are monitored, unless the Triggers Calculation checkbox
of the state variable is unchecked. A calculation of all Conditionals in
the Logix is triggered when any monitored state changes as noted below
(if not obvious).</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>Sensor Active</B>: Evaluates to true if the state of the
	specified sensor is active.</LI>
	<LI><B>Sensor Inactive</B>: Evaluates to true if the state of the
	specified sensor is inactive.</LI>
	<LI><B>Turnout Thrown</B>: Evaluates to true if the known state of

	the specified memory is the same as the value specified in the state
	variable. Calculation is triggered when the monitored memory value
	changes to or from the specified value.</LI>
	<LI><B>Fast Clock Range</B>: Evaluates to true if the current fast
	clock time is between the begin time and end time specified for the
	range. Times must be specified in hh:mm format, where hh is hours and
	mm is minutes, relative to a 24-hour clock. Calculation is triggered
	when the fast clock time enters the range and when the fast clock time
	exits the range.</LI>
	<LI><B>Signal Red</B>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of the
	specified signal head is red. Calculation is triggered when the
	appearance change to or from red.</LI>

	the specified signal head is yellow. Calculation is triggered when the
	appearance change to or from yellow.</LI>
	<LI><B>Signal Green</B>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of
	the specified signal head is green. Calculation is triggered when the
	appearance change to or from green.</LI>

	appearance of the specified signal head is flashing green. Calculation
	is triggered when the appearance change to or from flashing green.</LI>
	<LI><B>Signal Lit</B>: Evaluates to true if the specified signal
	head is lit.</LI>
	<LI><B>Signal Held</B>: Evaluates to true if the specified signal
	head is being held.</LI>
