      <h1>Signal Mast Repeater</h1>

      <p>The Signal Mast Repeater tool allows you to configure one
      Signal Mast to follow the state of another, or for a change on 
      either Signal Mast to force the other to the same state.</p>

      <p>Signal Mast Repeaters require that both Signal Masts must be of the same
      Signal System and the same Mast Type.  Signal Mast Repeaters cannot 
      be configured between masts of differing types or between signaling differing
      signaling systems.</p>
      
      <h2>Configuring a Repeater</h2>
      
      <p>The Signal Mast Repeater table is accessed via the "Tools" pull-down
          menu at the top of the Signal Masts Table window.</p>
      
      <h3>Adding a Repeater</h3>
      
      <p>When creating a new Repeater, and a Master mast is selected from the 
      pull-down list at the bottom of the window, the Slave pull-down list will 
      be populated with Signal Masts of the corresponding signaling system and 
      mast type. If there are no valid masts then the option to select the Slave
      will remain disabled, with an empty list.</p>
      
      <p>Once both a Master mast and a Slave mast have been selected, the "Add" button
      may be activated to add the Repeater to the list at the top of the window.</p>

      <h3>Configuring operation of a Repeater</h3>
      
      <p>The "Repeat" function may operate in any of three modes which define the
          direction(s) in which the "repeat function" occurs.
          The direction of repeat for a given Repeater is configured in the upper 
          part of the Signal Mast Repeater tool window using a button in the 
          column named "Update"  This column is typically found between the master 
          and slave name columns.  Activating the button sequences 
          through the three available modes.  Each mode is shown on the button by one or 
          two arrow-like representations of the direction in which repeats are made:</p>
      <table border="2">
          <tr>
              <td align="center"><img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterMaster-to-SlaveButton.png" 
                   alt="Master to Slave repeat button image" ></td>
              <td align="center">indicates that Master mast
          aspect changes are repeated to the Slave mast.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td align="center"><img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterSlave-to-MasterButton.png" 
                   alt="Master to Slave repeat button image"></td>
              <td align="center">indicates that Slave mast
          aspect changes are repeated to the Master mast.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td align="center"><img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterBidirectionalButton.png" 
                   alt="Master to Slave repeat button image"></td>
              <td align="center">indicates that any Master mast
          aspect change is repeated to the Slave mast, and any Slave mast aspect change is
          repeated to the Master mast.</td>
          </tr>
      </table>
          
      <p>By default, a Repeater is enabled when it is created.  It is possible to 
          disable an individual Repeater by un-checking the box in the "Enable" column
          for the particular row containing the Repeater.  This can be useful for 
          debugging your Repeater's effect on the layout.</p>

      <h2>A use-case for a Signal Mast Repeater</h2>
      <p>In those cases where there are multiple routes between a "source"
      signal mast and a "destination" signal mast, with no intervening
      signal masts, the regular JMRI Signal Mast Logic "discovery" project
      will only identify <strong>one</strong> of the valid routes.  JMRI's Signal 
      Mast Logic ignores any other existing routes and does not generate any logic 
      in the Source mast's logic for those un-discovered routes.</p>
      <p>The Layout Editor panel below shows a track arrangement where this
      Signal Mast Logic discovery shortcoming can be seen.  For this panel, there
      are three different routes from signal RA2.</p>
      <p> JMRI's Signal Mast Logic
      "discovery" finds only two of the three routes:
      <ul>
          <li>Route 1 - a route from RA2 to RA173, via switch 1 lined "reverse" (diverging) 
              and switch 5 lined normal; and</li>
          <li>Route 2 - a route from RA2 to RA171, via switch 1 lined "normal" (straight)</li>
      </ul>
          
      <p>JMRI Signal Mast Logic Discovery for RA2 fails to automatically discover the
      last route:
      <ul>
          <li>Route 3 - a route from RA2 to RA173 via switch 1 normal and Switch 3 reverse and
      Switch 5 reverse.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Each of the three routes is separately discussed below.</p>

      <h3>Example Route 1</h3>
      <p>This route is from signal RA2, via switch 1 "reversed" (thrown), and switch 5
          "normal" (closed), to signal RA173, and is shown below.</p>
      <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterRoute1.png" alt="an example showing a properly-discovered route from signal mast RA2 to signal mast RA173.">
      <p>Route 1 was properly discovered by the Signal Mast Logic and is shown in
          the top row of the Signal Mast Logic window image, below.  the Route 1
          logic is enabled (checked).  Under the conditions shown in the image 
          above, Route 1 is currently an active route, as indicated by the 
          associated check marks.  Examination of the conditions shown above shows
          that RA2 is presenting a "Diverging Clear" aspect (Red over Green over 
          Red).</p>
      <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterRoute1SMLogic.png" alt="an example showing the signal mast logic for the properly-discovered route from signal mast RA2 to signal mast RA173.">

      <h3>Example Route 2</h3>
      <p>This route is from signal RA2, via switch 1 "normal" (closed), and switch 3
          "normal" (closed), to signal RA171, and is shown below.</p>
      <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterRoute2.png" alt="an example showing a properly-discovered route from signal mast RA2 to signal mast RA171.">
      <p>Route 2 was properly discovered by the Signal Mast Logic and is shown in
          the second row of the Signal Mast Logic window image, below.  The Route 2
          logic is enabled (checked).  Under the conditions shown in the image 
          above, Route 2 is currently an active route, as indicated by the
          associated check marks.  Examination of the conditions shown above shows
          that RA2 is presenting a "Clear" aspect (Green over Red over Red).</p>
      <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterRoute2SMLogic.png" alt="an example showing the signal mast logic for the properly-discovered route from signal mast RA2 to signal mast RA171.">

      <h3>Example route 3 (the undiscovered route)</h3>
      <p>Route 3 is not discovered by the Signal Mast Logic.  This route is from
      signal RA2, via switch 1 "normal" (closed), switch 3 "reversed" (thrown)
      and switch 5 "reversed" (thrown) to signal RA173, and is shown below.</p>
      <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterRoute3.png" alt="an example showing two different routes from one signal mast to its destination signal mast">
      <p>Note that signal RA2 does <strong>not</strong> give an indication better 
      than "Stop" under these conditions, because there is no Signal Logic entry
      which discovered the path from RA2 to RA173 via this route.</p>
      <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterRoute3NoSMLogic.png" alt="Signal Mast Logic automatically generated by the 'discovery' process">
      <p>Note that neither of the two rows of the Signal Mast Logic table shown above
      are marked as "Active", because the route requirements of these two Signal
      Mast Logic entries are not met.</p>

      <h2>Why Signal Mast Logic discovery misses the third route</h2>
      <p>When discovering signal mast pairs between which to create Signal
      Mast Logic, JMRI <strong>finds only one path</strong> between a given signal mast
      pair.  JMRI's discovery process <strong>then stops looking for other paths between
      those two signal masts</strong>, and moves on to discovery for another signal mast pair.</p>
      <p>There are a variety of technical reasons for this
      behavior, and, at least for the near future, there is no expectation that
      this behavior will change.  A workaround is needed.</p>

      <h2>The workaround</h2>

      <p>That explanation of the problem contains a hint on how to resolve the
      problem - JMRI's Signal Mast Logic works with unique pairs of signals.  This
      implies that a signal mast which duplicates the behavior of RA173 might
      allow Signal Mast Logic to be created for the undiscovered route from RA2 to
      RA173.</p>

      <p>The duplicate of signal mast RA173 turns out to be a great idea! And it
      is the beginning of the solution!</p>

      <p>But a given point on a Layout Editor panel can only have <strong>one</strong>
      signal mast governing movement in a given direction.  That means that the duplicate
      signal mast <strong>cannot</strong> be tied to the same spot on the panel.  And, in a roundabout
      way, it also means that Signal Mast Logic discovery <strong>is unable</strong> to automatically
      identify the alternate path to the the duplicate of RA173.</p>

      <p>Proceeding from this point requires manual work - it is necessary to
      manually create the Signal Mast Logic entry which we would have preferred
      that Signal Mast Logic discovery would create.  That's where the "Add Signal Logic"
      button on the signal's "Signal Mast Logic" window comes into play.</p>

      <h2>Workaround for the example</h2>
      <p>The steps to work around the Signal Mast Discovery shortcoming described above
      are:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Create a duplicate "destination" signal mast;</li>
          <li>Configure the duplicate mast as a Signal Mast Repeater for the 
              primary destination signal mast;</li>
          <li>Place the virtual signal mast on the Layout Editor panel;</li>
          <li>Manually create the required Signal Mast Logic;</li>
          <li>Test the logic.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The steps are detailed here:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Create the duplicate destination Signal Mast
              <ol>
                  <li>Open the <a href="SignalMastTable.shtml">Signal Mast Table</a>,
                  via "Tools"->"Tables"->"Signal Masts".</li>
                  <li><a href="AddEditSignalingLogic.shtml">Add</a> the dummy
                  signal mast to be a near-identical of the physical
                  signal mast, which is RA173 in this case.  For ease of reference,
                  choose a name that is similar to the mast being mimic'd - 
                  in the case here, "Virtual RA173".<br>
                  This dummy mast must use the same "signaling system" as
                  the mast it is to mimic, and it must be of the same "mast type".
                  The Repeater need not use the same "Mast Driver" type.<br>
                  If no physical representation of the repeated mast is required, 
                  the Mast Driver type of "Virtual Mast" may be used.  If the chosen Mast 
                  Driver type uses one or more a hardware addresses, be sure to 
                  use address information which is not already in-use by any 
                  other layout hardware or other virtual masts.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Configure the duplicate Signal Mast to repeat the physical Signal Mast
              <ol>
                  <li>Select the "Tools" pull-down on the Signal Mast Table's tool
                  bar.  Select "Repeaters".  This opens the "Signal Mast Repeaters"
                  window, and pre-populates the "Master" signal list at the bottom
                  of the window with all available signal masts.</li>
                  <li>At the bottom of the window, select the "Master" signal - 
                  in this case, mast "RA173".  The tool will
                  then pre-populate the list of "Slave" signal masts which use the same
                  signaling system and mast type as the selected Master mast.</li>
                  <li>Select the "Slave" Signal Mast to act in conjunction with
                      the selected Master Signal Mast - in this case, mast "Virtual RA173".<p>
                  <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterCreation0.png"/> </li>
                  <li>Activate the "Add" button.  This will place a new line in the table
                  of repeaters at in top section of the window.</li>
                  <li>The arrowhead within the table entry for "RA173" and "Virtual RA173"
                  determines whether changes to one signal mast will be reflected by
                  the other mast.  By default, a change on one mast will be reflected
                  on the other, as shown by the button shown below:"<br>
                  <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterBidirectionalButton.png" 
                   alt="Master to Slave repeat button image">
                  <p>Click on that button to cycle the arrowheads so that there is 
                  only one arrowhead, and it should point towards "Virtual RA173". 
                  This means that changes to RA173's indication will be reflected 
                  upon Virtual RA173, but that changes on Virtual RA173 will not 
                  be reflected upon RA173. This is shown below.<p>
                  <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterCreation.png"/> </li>
                  <li>You may now close the Signal Mast Repeater window.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Optionally, place the duplicate Signal Mast on the Layout Editor panel.<br>
              (Note that placing the the duplicate Signal Mast on the Layout Editor
              panel provides no obvious functional advantages for this Repeater 
              use-case, and is done mainly for debugging purposes.)
              <ol>
                  <li>Place the new virtual Signal Mast somewhere on the Layout Editor
                  panel.  It is necessary to select the "Signal Mast Icon" radio
                  button, and select the newly-created dummy mast in the adjacent
                  selection box.</li>
                  <li>Place the icon onto the panel in some location which makes
                  sense to you.  I chose to place it immediately below RA173, as
                  shown below.<p>
                  <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterIconPlaced.png"/></li>
                  <li>You might wish to right-click on the virtual Signal Mast and
                  select the option to "hide" the Signal Mast icon
                  when not in "edit" mode.  For the purposes of this example, the icon
                  remains un-hidden.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Create the Signal Mast Logic for the undiscovered route.
              <ol>
              <li>Right-click on RA2 and select the "Signal Mast Logic: RA2" selection.
              This opens up the "Signal Mast Pairs: RA2" window (For further help,
              see <a href="AddEditSignalingLogic.shtml">Adding/Editing Signal Mast Logic</a>.)</li>
              <li>Select the destination mast "Virtual RA173".<p>
              <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterCreationSelectDestination.png"/></li>
              <li>Add the "Blocks" associated with the route.
                  <ol>
                    <li>In the "blocks" section, select all of the blocks between the entering
                    signal RA2 and the leaving signal (Virtual) RA173 which are on the
                    "undiscovered" route. In this case, blocks 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 are on
                    the "undiscovered" path.  They must be entered as "Unoccupied", since
                    signal RA2 <strong>must not</strong> indicate anything other
                    than "Stop" if any of those blocks is occupied. This configuration
                    is shown below.<p>
                    <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterCreationBlocks.png"/></li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Add the "Turnouts", and their positions, associated with the route.
                  <ol>
                    <li>Select the "Turnouts" tab. "Include" each of the turnouts, and each one's
                    required direction of throw, for those turnouts on the route of the
                    undiscovered path between the entering signal RA2 and the leaving
                    signal (Virtual) RA173.
                    In this case, Turnout 1 must be "closed" (normal), Turnout 3 must
                    be "thrown" (reversed), and Turnout 5 must be "thrown" (reversed)
                    on this route.  This configuration is shown below.<p>
                    <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterCreationTurnouts.png"/></li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <li>If necessary, add any opposing "Signal Mast(s)" associated with
                  the route.  This is often a requirement for signals in CTC territory.
                  <ol>
                    <li>If you find it necessary to prevent absolute signal RA2
                    from clearing when opposing absolute signal LA4 displays
                    anything less-restrictive than "stop", then Signal Mast LA4
                    must be included in the RA4 Signal Mast Logic's "Signal Mast"
                    tab.  RA2's Signal Mast Logic entry must require that LA4 is
                    at "Stop".  This configuration is shown below.<p>
              <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterCreationMasts.png"/></li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p>The resulting Signal Mast Logic list for RA2 appears similar to
              the image below, although the "Active" logic item may be selected
              differently, or no "Active" item may be shown, depending on layout
              conditions.</p>
              <img src="images/SignalMastRepeaterFinalSignalMastLogic.png"/>
          </li>
          <li>Select the "Update Signal Logic" button to make the changes to the
          RA2 Signal Mast Logic.</li>
          <li>Save your work!  Select "File"->"Store Panels...".  </li>
          <li>Exit the Layout Editor "Edit" mode.</li>
      </ol>

      That completes the changes!
      <h3>Testing the workaround</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Click on Turnout 1 until it is "closed" (normal, straight route, ...).
          Click on Turnout 2 until it is "closed".  Click on signal RA171 until it gives
          an indication which is less-restrictive than "Stop and Proceed".  You should get
          an indication greater than "stop" on RA2.  If not, make sure that the
          sensors associated with the blocks in the path are all "unoccupied" (i.e inactive).</li>
          <li>Once you get RA2 to automatically upgrade from "Stop", click on RA171 to cycle thru
              its available indications and watch to see which indications show on RA2. Note that
          the "Speed" settings for the turnouts and the blocks in the path can all affect the
          indications seen on RA2.  See below.</li>
          <li>Line switch 1 to its diverging position, and line switch 5 to its straight
          position.  Click on signal RA173 until it gives an indication which is
          less-restrictive than "Stop and Proceed".  You should automatically get
          an indication greater than "stop" on RA2.  If not, make sure that the
          sensors associated with the blocks in the path are all "unoccupied" (i.e inactive).</li>
          <li>Once you get RA2 to automatically upgrade from "Stop" for this path,
          click on RA173 to cycle thru its available indications and watch
          to see which indications show on RA2. Note that the "Speed"
          settings for the turnouts and the blocks in the path can all affect
          the indications seen on RA2.</li>
          <li>Then test the route which was not found by the "discover" process.
          Line Switch 1 "normal", Switch 3 "diverging" and Switch 5 "diverging".
          This should activate the manually-entered route in the Signal Mast Logic,
          and should allow changes to RA173 to affect signal RA2.
          This should allow RA2 to properly display something other than "Stop",
          as shown here.<p>

      </ul>

      <p>The speed settings for the turnouts and blocks in a given path all can
          influence the aspect shown on the signal.  The slowest speed on any part
          of the route will limit the signal indication to one which allows that
          speed (or some lower speed, if that specific speed is not available by
          signal indication).</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong>If the individual turnouts are left at JMRI's 
          "default" values, then any route with a diverging turnout will 
          automatically force the signal to a maximum speed of "restricting" for 
          the route. To achieve the images shown above, it was necessary to 
          change the turnout "diverging" speeds (in the Turnouts table) to be at 
          least "Slow", as shown below.  For the selected signaling system, that 
          was sufficient to allow the signal mast logic to choose "Diverging Clear" 
          (Red-Green-Red) for those routes where a switch required a diverging 
          route.</p>

      <h3>A General Note on Signal Repeaters and Multiple Routes</h3>
      <p>This concept can be extended to situations where "n" routes are available
      from one signal mast to another signal mast.  With "n" routes, discovery
      will only find one of those "n" routes.  Using the workaround described above,
      it is necessary to create "n-1" signal mast repeaters for the destination
      mast.  And it is necessary to manually create "n-1" Signal Mast Logic entries
      from the source signal mast to each of the virtual copies of the destination
      mast.  (The example given above is described the case where the value of "n"
      was 2.)</p>
