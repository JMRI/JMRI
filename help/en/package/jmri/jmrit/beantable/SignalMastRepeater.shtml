<H1>Signal Mast Repeater</H1>
<p>
The Signal Mast Repeater tool allows you to configure one Signal Mast to follow the state of another, or for both Signal Masts to update each others state.
<br>
For this to work, both Signal Masts must be of the same Signal System and Mast Type.<br>
When a Master mast is selected from the list at the bottom of the screen the Slave list will be populated with the corresponding Signal Masts of the same system and type. 
If there are no valid masts then the option to select the Slave will remain disabled.
<p>
In the main table it is possible to select which direction the updates will take place, either Master to Slave, Slave To Master or Bothway. You can also disable/enable the Repeater along with deleting it from this screen.
