      <h2>Some stuff about RailCom itself</h2>
      
      <h2>Column Contents</h2>
      <dl>
      <dt>Address</dt>
        <dd>A simplified DCC address associated with this report. 
            This is also used as the Tag ID in the enclosing IdTag
            and as part of that IdTags system name.
            This  is just the numerical DCC address, without distinguishing
            between short, long and consist addresses.
        </dd>
      <dt>Where Seen</dt>
        <dd>The name of the Reporter which has most-recent seen this RailCom report.
        </dd>
      <dt>When Seen</dt>
        <dd>The time that this value was recorded by the detector.
        </dd>
      <dt>Clear</dt>
        <dd>Clears the Where Seen and When Seen columns, effectively removing this
            tag from the current status of the model railroad.
        </dd>
      <dt>Speed</dt>
        <dd>If available,  the most recent speed reported back from
            the decoder.  Note that the units of this are configured in 
            the decoder.  They could be miles-per-hour or kilometers-per-hour.
        </dd>
      <dt>DCC Address</dt>
        <dd>The full DCC address of the RailCom report.  This can be 
            any valid DCC address type including the short, long, consist and 
            extended consist forms.
        </dd>
      <dt>Orientation</dt>
        <dd>Whether the front of the device is facing EAST or WEST.
            These two directions are defined by the polarity of the
            wiring from the track to the relevant RailCom Detector.
        </dd>
      <dt>Direction</dt>
        <dd>Whether the device is moving FORWARD, BACKWARD or UNKNOWN.
        </dd>
      <dt>Motion</dt>
        <dd>Whether the motion state of the device is 
            MOVING,  STATIONARY or UNKNOWN.
        </dd>
      <dt>QoS</dt>
        <dd>Quality of Service.  One of GOOD, POOR and UNKNOWN.
        </dd>
