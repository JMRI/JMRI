<P>The first thing you must do when creating a route is name it. In
the box labeled "Route System Name" enter a unique name for your route.
You can optionally enter a more descriptive name in the "Route User
Name" box.</P>
<P>The radio button below the "Route User Name" allows you to show
only the turnouts or sensors that are part of this route. There are two
tables below the "Show" button, the first one contains turnouts and the
second contains sensors. Click the "Include" box in either table to add
the desired turnouts or sensor to your route. Next to the "Include" box
is the action that the turnout or sensor can perform when the route is
triggered. For example, if you wish the turnout to throw when the route
is triggered select "Set Thrown" in the drop down box.</P>
<P>Below the turnout and sensor tables are three optional features.
Playing a sound file, running a script, and specifying a sensor to go
active when all the turnouts specified for the route are correctly
aligned. Sound files and Scripts are configured by hitting the
appropriate &quot;Set&quot; button and selecting the sound file to be
played, or the script file to be run when the route is triggered. To add
a sensor which will go active when the turnouts are aligned, enter the
sensor system name in the box. The sensor will go Active when the
turnouts are correctly aligned for the route.</P>
<P>A route can be optionally triggered by any of the three sensors
shown in the table. Enter their names (system name or user name) and
select the action that will trigger the route. Logic choices are
described in detail <A
	HREF="..\..\..\..\html\tools\Routes.shtml#sensorlogic">Controlling
Routes from Sensors</A>.</P>
<P>A route can be also triggered by a turnout. Enter the name of the
turnout (system name or user name) and select the turnout action that
will trigger the route. Logic choices are explained in detail <A
	HREF="..\..\..\..\html\tools\Routes.shtml#turnoutlogic">Controlling
Routes from a Turnout</A>.</P>

<P>In some cases, it might be necessary to delay or slow down the
rate that JMRI sends commands to change turnouts on the layout. By
entering a value in the "added delay" box, you can increase the amount
of time (in milliseconds) between turnout commands when this route is
triggered. By default JMRI inserts a minimum delay of 250 milliseconds
(1/4 of a second) between turnout commands.</P>
<P>The next text box allows you to enter a turnout that will lock
this route. When a route is locked, all of the turnouts defined for the
route become locked. See <A HREF="#Turnout lock feature"> below </A> for more info.</P>
<P>Once you are satisfied with your route, use the "Add Route"
button to create the route. To save your route you must use the "Store
Panel" command which can be found under the "Panels" main menu. If you
decide that you need to change your route, use the "Edit" and "Update
Route" buttons to modify your route.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Turnout lock feature">Turnout lock feature</A></H2>

<P>The turnout lock feature allows you to selectively disable
accessory (turnouts) commands from cabs and/or locally-wired pushbuttons. JMRI
disables pushbuttons by sending pushbutton disable commands to the
turnout decoders when the route is locked, and enables the pushbuttons
when the route is unlocked. When locking a turnout from cab commands,
the JMRI program will monitor the turnout's accessory address and if it
detects a change command from a cab, will cancel the command immediately
by sending out the opposite command to the turnout. All turnouts that
are being monitored by the JMRI program and are included in the route
will be locked.</P>
<P>To help you select a set of turnouts to lock or unlock, a route
can be locked or unlocked. In the route edit window, an optional lock
control turnout is available. You can use the lock control turnout to
enable or disable the route lock function from a panel turnout icon, a
layout turnout or a phantom turnout. A phantom turnout is a turnout that
can be accessed by your cab but doesn't actually exist on your layout.</P>
<P>For more information on how to set turnouts to be lockable,
please see the <A HREF="TurnoutTable.shtml#Turnout%20lock%20feature">Turnout
Table page</A>.</P>
