      <h1><a name="Adding_Editing_Routes"
      id="Adding_Editing_Routes"></a>Adding/Editing
      Routes</h1>

      <p>After clicking <strong>Add...</strong> below the Route
      table, the following panel appears:</p><a href=
      "images/RouteAddEdit.png"><img src="images/RouteAddEdit.png" width="518"
      height="394"></a>

      <p>The first thing you must do when creating a route is name
      it. In the box labeled "System Name" enter a unique name for
      your Route. You can optionally enter a more descriptive name
      in the "User Name" box.</p>

      <p>The radio button below the "User Name" allows you to show
      only the turnouts or sensors that are part of this route.
      There are two tables below the "Show:" radio buttons; the
      first one contains Turnouts and the second contains Sensors.
      Click the "Include" box in either table to add the desired
      Turnouts or Sensor to your route. Next to the "Include" box
      is the action that the included Turnouts or Sensors can
      perform when the Route is triggered. For example, if you wish
      the Turnout to be Thrown when the Route is triggered select
      "Set Thrown" in the drop down box.</p>

      <p>Below the Turnout and Sensor tables are three optional
      features:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Playing a sound file</li>

        <li>running a script and</li>

        <li>specifying a sensor to go active when all the turnouts
        specified for the route are correctly aligned.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Sound files and Scripts are configured by hitting the
      appropriate "..." button and selecting the sound file to be
      played or the script file to be run when the Route is
      triggered.<br>
      To add a Sensor which will go active when all turnouts are
      properly aligned, elect the Sensor from the list. The Sensor
      will go Active when the Turnouts are correctly aligned for
      the Route.</p>

      <p>A Route can optionally be triggered by any of up to three
      sensors. Select them from the three drop down lists and for
      each select the condition that will trigger the Route. Logic
      choices are described under <a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Routes.shtml#sensorlogic">Controlling
      Routes from Sensors</a>.</p>

      <p>A Route can be also triggered by a Turnout. Select this
      Control Turnout from the list and select the turnout Action
      that will trigger the Route. Logic choices are explained
      under <a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Routes.shtml#turnoutlogic">Controlling
      Routes from a Turnout</a>.</p>

      <p>In some cases, it might be necessary to delay (slow down)
      the rate JMRI sends commands to change the Turnouts on the
      layout. By entering a value in the "Added Delay" box, you can
      increase the amount of time (in milliseconds) between turnout
      commands when this Route is triggered. By default JMRI
      inserts a delay of 250 milliseconds (1/4 of a second) between
      turnout commands.</p>

      <p>The next drop down allows you to select a Turnout that
      will lock this route. When a Route is Locked, all of the
      Turnouts defined for the Route become <a href=
      "#Turnout_lock_feature">Locked</a>.</p>

      <p>Once you are satisfied with your Route, use the "Add"
      button to create the new Route. To save your Route in your configuration, you must
      then use the "Store Panel" command which can be found under
      the "Panels" main menu. If you decide that you need to change
      your Route, use the "Edit" and "Update Route" buttons to
      modify it.</p>

      <h2><a name="Turnout_Lock_feature">Turnout Lock
      feature</a></h2>

      <p>The Turnout Lock feature allows you to selectively disable
      accessory (turnout) commands from cabs and/or locally-wired
      pushbuttons. JMRI disables pushbuttons by sending pushbutton
      disable commands to the Turnout decoders when the Route is
      locked, and enables the pushbuttons when the Route is
      unlocked. When locking a Turnout from cab commands, the JMRI
      program will monitor the Turnout's accessory address and if
      it detects a change command from a cab, will cancel the
      command immediately by sending out the opposite command to
      the Turnout. All Turnouts that are being monitored by the
      JMRI program and are included in the Route will be
      locked.</p>

      <p>To help you select a series of Turnouts to lock or unlock,
      a complete Route can be locked or unlocked. In the "Edit
      Route" pane, an optional Lock Control Turnout is available as
      the last drop down. You can use the Lock Control Turnout to
      enable or disable the Route Lock function from a Panel
      Turnout icon, a layout turnout or a phantom Turnout. A
      phantom Turnout is a turnout that can be accessed by your cab
      but doesn't actually exist on your layout.</p>

      <p>For more information on how to set Turnouts to be
      lockable, see the <a href=
      "TurnoutTable.shtml#Turnout_lock_feature">Turnout Table
      page</a>.</p>
