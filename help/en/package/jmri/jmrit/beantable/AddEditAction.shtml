<h1>Add/Edit Action</h1>
<h2>The Add/Edit Action Window</h2>

<p><b><a href="ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a></b> are tasks that 
can be initiated automatically as a train running in automatic mode traverses 
the layout. The Add/Edit Action window (see below for "Add" version) provides for 
creating new Actions and for editing current Actions. The "Edit"
version of this window is the same as the one shown below, except the <b>Create 
New Action</b> button is replaced by an <b>Update Action</b> button and the 
selections and data are filled in to current values of the Action being 
edited.</p>

<p>An Action is defined by specifying <b>What</b> action is requested and 
<b>When</b> that action should be initiated.</p>
<p>To specify the <b>When</b> part, select an option in the <b>When</b> popup 
menu, and fill in any data that might be required. Data item fields or menus 
will appear when the item needing them is selected. Each data item is supplied 
with a text description (tooltip) that may be summoned by hovering the cursor over 
the item. Each <b>When</b> option is described in more detail in  
<b><a href="ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a></b>.</p>
<p>An optional delay, specified in milliseconds, is available for each <b>When</b> 
option. No delay is the default.  If an optional delay time is not entered (or a 
delay time of zero is entered), the action will be initiated immediately after 
the <i>when</i> event occurs. If a delay time is specified, the program will wait 
for the specified time after the <i>when</i> event occurs before initiating the 
action.</p>
<p>To specify <b>What</b> action is requested, select an option in the <b>What</b> 
popup menu, and fill in any data that might be required. Data item fields 
will appear when the item needing them is selected. Each data item is supplied 
with a text description (tooltip) that may be summoned by hovering the cursor over
the item. Each <b>What</b> action is described in more detail in 
<b><a href="ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a></b>.</p>

<p>When the Action is completely defined, click the <b>Create New 
Action</b> button (or the <b>Update Action</b> button if editing). Any required 
data will be validated. If a problem is found, a message will appear, and 
the Add/Edit Action window will remain to allow correction of the problem. If 
everything checks out, the Add/Edit Action window will disappear and the new (or 
edited) Action will appear in the <b>View Actions</b> window.</p>

<p> Click the <b>Cancel</b> button to dismiss the Add/Edit Action window without 
creating a new Action or completing the edit of an existing  
Action. Closing the Add/Edit Action window is equivalent to clicking the 
<b>Cancel</b> button.</p>
