<h1>Transits and the Transit Table</h1>
<h2>What is a Transit?</h2>

<p>A <b>Transit</b> is a group of two or more connected 
<b><a href="SectionTable.shtml">Sections</a></b> that describes a route around 
the layout of a train traveling in a given direction. A Section may be 
in multiple Transits, and may be in a given Transit multiple times. Sections are 
kept in order--the first Section is connected to the second, the second 
is connected to the third, etc. That means a Section in a Transit must be connected 
to the Section before it (if there is one) and to the Section after it (if there is 
one). The order of the Sections determines the direction of travel in the Transit. 
Trains travel from Sections with lower sequence numbers toward Sections with higher
sequence numbers. Normally Transits would only be defined for mainline track, and  
sometimes staging yard track.</p> 
<p>In user-specified areas of a Transit, <i>alternate</i> Sections may be designated. 
For example, to move between the "2nd" and "4th" Sections in a Transit, there may  
be multiple "3rd" Sections, any of which might be used to travel between the 2nd and 
4th Sections. Alternate Sections provide for passing tracks and staging yards. 
Transits also provide for reverse loops. To provide for back-and-forth running, e.g. 
for trolley cars, an option is provided in Dispatcher to automatically reverse the 
direction of running through a Transit when the train reaches the end of its 
Transit, and have the train run in reverse to the beginning of its Transit.</p>
<p>Transits support both manual and automatic operation of trains.  When a train 
is running in automatic mode, Transits provide for <b>Actions</b> to be 
activated when a train reaches a designated Section in the Transit. An 
Action may be initiated by a number of events, for 
example, when the train enters a Section, or when the train stops. A variety of 
actions are possible, such as pausing the train for a user-designated 
number of fast clock minutes (a station stop), reverting to manual mode for local manual 
operation, or sounding the horn on a sound decoder.</p>

<h2>How are Transits Activated and Used?</h2>
<p>Transits are static objects. They specify routes for trains to follow around the 
layout. Transits do not run trains, or keep track of running trains. A Transit 
becomes part of the train running process when it is <i>activated</i> by being 
assigned to an <b>Active Train</b>. Transits are saved as part of a panel/configuration 
file, only need to be set up once, and can be reused. Active Trains, on the other 
hand are dynamic and transient.  Active Trains are not saved to disk, and must be 
set up each time they are used.</p>
<p>Transits are <i>activated</i> in the 
<a href="../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a> window, where a Transit is 
linked to a train to create an Active Train. When an Active Train is created, a 
Transit is selected, a Train is selected, and a starting Block (train location 
at start) and ending Block (train location when travel is complete) are specified, along 
with options. This process results in an <b>Active Train</b>, which can then be 
dispatched. A Transit may be used by only one Active Train at a time. When an Active 
Train is done, its Transit is <i>deactivated</i>, and may be reused for a subsequent 
Active Train.</p>
<p>A train may start from a Block outside of the Transit, but connected 
to a Block within the Transit, or a train may start from a Block within a Section 
in the Transit. A train moves through a Transit in only one direction--defined by 
the order in which Sections are included in the Transit. Trains move from lower 
sequence number Sections toward higher sequence number Sections. The only exception 
to this is the back-and-forth option that allows a train to run in reverse through 
its Transit back to the beginning of the Transit.</p>
<p>When an Active 
Train is initiated, an <i>allocation</i> request is placed for a starting Section.
If the Section is free, the Section will be <i>allocated</i> to the train. 
<i>Allocation</i> means that the Section is assigned the Active Train, and the 
train is authorized by the dispatcher to proceed to the end of that Section.</p>
<p>When an Active Train is created, it may be activated for running by an engineer 
using a throttle, or automatically by a <i>virtual engineer</i>. Dispatching 
consists of <i>allocating</i> Sections, one by one, to the Active Train. The 
actual dispatching may be done by a dispatcher sitting at the computer running JMRI, 
or semi-automatically by the computer. If a requested Section is currently in 
use, a request for assignment is placed in the dispatcher's queue. When a Section 
is freed, the queue is scanned for the highest priority train requesting it.</p>

<h2>Using the Transit Table to Set Up Transits</h2>
<p>Transits are set up in the Transit Table. When set up, Transits are independent 
of the trains that use them.  
<p>All Transits that currently exist can be referenced
using the <b>Transits</b> tool under <b>Tables</b> in the Tools menu of most 
JMRI programs. There are seven columns in the Transit Table:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>System Name</b> - The system name is assigned to the Transit when it's created, 
	and can't be changed.</li>
	<li><b>User Name</b> - If you're interested in having your Transits carry "human 
	readable" names, you can click in the "User Name" column and change that information
	to whatever you want.</li>
	<li><b>State</b> - The state of a Transit tells whether a section is <b>IDLE</b> 
	(available for activation and assignment to a train), or <b>ASSIGNED</b> (linked 
	to a train to form an Active Train). The state of a newly added Transit is always 
	<b>IDLE</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Comment</b> - This column is for your use to record any comment you may want
	to use to keep track of your Transits. It is for information only.</li>
	<li>Click the <b>Delete</b> button in a specific row to delete the Transit in that 
	row. Use this button with caution! Do not delete a running Transit.</li>
	<li>Click the <b>Edit</b> button in a row to view or change entered information
	for a Transit. System name cannot be changed. User name may be changed, 
	Sections may be redefined, etc. Only one Transit may be edited at a time. A 
	Transit may not be edited if another is being created, or if the Transit is 
	not in the IDLE state.</li>
	<li>Click the <b>Duplicate</b> button in a row to add another Transit identical 
	to this one. Clicking this button is similar to clicking the <b>Add...</b> 
	button (see below) except the information from this Transit is copied into the 
	Add/Edit Transit window. This option offers an easy way to enter multiple copies 
	of a Transit when multiple trains must follow the same route at the same time.
	</li>
	</ul>
<p>To define a new Transit, click the <b><a href="TransitAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>
</b> button. An Add/Edit Transit window will 
be brought up that will allow you to designate the Sections in the new Transit.  
(Obviously, Sections must be defined before any Transit can be created.) Since a 
Transit may be used in only one Active Train at a time, the Duplicate option 
(see above) may save time when creating multiple copies of the same Transit.</p>
<H3>Using the Layout Editor to Set Up Transits</H3>
If you are using the Layout Editor to define and generate the Logic for Signal Masts and
Sections, it is possible to create a basic transit from the Layout Editor.  To do this, 
bring up the context menu (right-click) of a Signal Mast on the panel, if things have 
been set up correctly then there be the option to <b>Create Transit From Here</b>, after 
selecting that option you can then progress along your route and select each facing SignalMast, 
bringing up the context menu on each and selecting <b>Add to Transit</b>.  When you are at the 
destination SignalMast on your route select <b>Add to Transit and Complete</b>.  Please note that
you will have to manually save the transits to disk.

<h2>Setting up for Continuous Running</h2>
<p> A Transit may be set up for continuous running, allowing an Active Train to 
travel through its Transit multiple times without being terminated and 
re-activated. Provided its Transit is set up for continuous running, 
each time an Active Train completes traveling through its Transit, the Active 
Train optionally may be automatically reset by Dispatcher so it 
is ready to run through its Transit again.  For continuous running, an Active 
Train must start and end in the same Section, and must be pointed in the same 
direction when starting and when ending. For a Transit to be capable of 
continuous running, its first Section and its last Section must be the same, 
and both must be set up for running in the same direction. This applies to 
both manual running of trains and automatic running of trains. For more 
information on setting the continuous running option, visit the help file for 
the <a href="../dispatcher/NewTrain.shtml">Activate New Train</a> window.</p>

<h2>Specifying Actions for Automatic Running </h2>
<p>Transits support a variety of <b>Actions</b> that automatically happen when a train is 
run through the Transit in Automatic mode.  One or more <b>Actions</b> may be specified 
with each Section in the Transit. <b>Action</b> are initiated when their associated 
Section in the Transit is entered by the automatically running train.</p>
<p>Each <b>Action</b> has two parts: a <i>When</i> part, that specifies 
when the <b>Action</b> is to be performed, and a <i>What</i> part, that specifies what 
task is to be performed. A commonly used Action, for example, is "When the train starts, 
turn on its headlight." More information on Actions is located in the Actions

<h2>Saving Transits to Disk</h2>
<p> Use the Store item in the File menu to save Transit information to disk. This 
information is saved with the configuration in an XML file, along
with control panel setup and similar items.  To store your panels in the same 
file (recommended), select <b>File</b> -&gt; <b>Store > Store Configuration and Panels To 
File...</b> or select <b>Panels > Store panels...</b> in the main JMRI window.
