      <h1>Transit Table Help</h1>

      <p>All the Transits that JMRI knows about can be viewed using
      the <strong>Transit Table</strong>.</p>

      <p>To open this tool, select <strong>Transits</strong> in the
      <strong>Tables</strong> submenu of the <strong>Tools</strong> menu of the main
      JMRI program window.</p>

      <h2>Using the Transit Table</h2>

      <p>Transits are set up in the Transit Table. When set up,
      Transits are independent of the Trains that use them.</p>

      <p>All Transits that currently exist can be referenced using
      the <strong>Transits</strong> tool under <strong>Tables</strong> in the Tools
      menu of most JMRI programs. There are seven columns in the
      Transit Table:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>System Name</strong> - The system name is assigned to the
        Transit when it's created, and can't be changed.</li>

        <li><strong>User Name</strong> - If you're interested in having your
        Transits carry "human readable" names, you can click in the
        "User Name" column and change that information to whatever
        you want.</li>

        <li><strong>State</strong> - The state of a Transit tells whether a
        section is <strong>IDLE</strong> (available for activation and
        assignment to a Train), or <strong>ASSIGNED</strong> (linked to a
        Train to form an Active Train). The state of a newly added
        Transit is always <strong>IDLE</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>Comment</strong> - This column is for your use to record
        any comment you may want to use to keep track of your
        Transits. It is for information only.</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button in a specific row to
        delete the Transit in that row. Use this button with
        caution! Do not delete a running Transit.</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button in a row to view or change
        entered information for a Transit. System name cannot be
        changed. User name may be changed, Sections may be
        redefined, etc. Only one Transit may be edited at a time. A
        Transit may not be edited if another is being created, or
        if the Transit is not in the IDLE state.</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Duplicate</strong> button in a row to add
        another Transit identical to this one. Clicking this button
        is similar to clicking the <strong>Add...</strong> button (see below)
        except the information from this Transit is copied into the
        Add/Edit Transit window. This option offers an easy way to
        enter multiple copies of a Transit when multiple Trains
        must follow the same route at the same time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To define a new Transit, click the <strong><a href=
      "TransitAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a></strong> button. An Add/Edit
      Transit window will be brought up that will allow you to
      designate the Sections in the new Transit. (Obviously,
      Sections must be defined before any Transit can be created.)
      Since a Transit may be used in only one Active Train at a
      time, the Duplicate option (see above) may save time when
      creating multiple copies of the same Transit.</p>

      <h3>Using the Layout Editor to Set Up Transits</h3>
      If you are using a
      <a href="../display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor</a>
      Panel to define and generate the Logic for
      Signal Masts and Sections, it is possible to create a basic
      Transit from the Layout Editor. To do this, bring up the
      context menu (right-click) of a Signal Mast on the panel. If
      things have been set up correctly you will see the option to
      <strong>Create Transit From Here</strong>. After selecting that option
      you can progress along your route and select each facing
      Signal Mast, bringing up the context menu on each and
      selecting <strong>Add to Transit</strong>. When you are at the final
      destination Signal Mast on your route, select <strong>Add to Transit
      and Complete</strong> in the context menu of that last Signal Mast.
      <br>
      Please note that you will have to manually save the Transits
      to disk (see below).

      <h2>Setting up for Continuous Running</h2>

      <p>A Transit may be set up for continuous running, allowing
      an Active Train to travel through its Transit multiple times
      without being terminated and re-activated. Provided its
      Transit is set up for continuous running, each time an Active
      Train completes traveling through its Transit, the Active
      Train optionally may be automatically reset by
      <a href="../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a> so
      it is ready to run through its Transit again. For a Transit to be capable of
      continuous running, its first Section and its last Section
      must be the same, and both must be set up for running in the
      same direction. This applies to both Manual and Automatic
      running of Trains.</p>
      <p>For more information on setting the continuous running option,
      visit the <a href="../dispatcher/NewTrain.shtml">Activate New
      Train</a> Help.</p>

      <h2>Specifying Actions for Automatic Running</h2>

      <p>Transits support a variety of
      <strong><a href="ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a></strong> that
      automatically happen when a Train is run through the Transit
      in Automatic mode. One or more <strong>Actions</strong> may be
      specified with each Section in the Transit. <strong>Action</strong> are
      initiated when their associated Section in the Transit is
      entered by the Automatically run Train.<br>
      Each <strong>Action</strong> has two parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <em>When</em> part, that specifies when the <strong>Action</strong>
        is to be performed, and</li>
        <li>a <em>What</em> part, that specifies what <strong>Action</strong> task
        is to be performed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A commonly used Action, for example, is "When the
      train starts, turn on its headlight." More information on
      Actions is located in the Actions.
      Read <a href="ViewSpecialActions.shtml">more on Actions</a>.</p>

      <h2>Saving Transits to Disk</h2>

      <p>Use the Store item in the File menu to save Transit
      information to disk. This information is saved with the
      configuration in an XML file, along with control panel setup
      and similar items. To store your panels in the same file
      (recommended), select <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Store &gt; Store
      Configuration and Panels To File...</strong> or select <strong>Panels
      &gt; Store panels...</strong> in the main JMRI window.</p>
