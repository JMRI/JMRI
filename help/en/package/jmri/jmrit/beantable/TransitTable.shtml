      <h1>Transits and the Transit Table</h1>

      <h2>What is a Transit?</h2>

      <p>A <b>Transit</b> is a group of two or more connected
      <b><a href="SectionTable.shtml">Sections</a></b> that
      describes a route around the layout of a Train traveling in a
      given direction using JMRI <a href=
      "../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a>.<br>
      A Section may be in multiple Transits, and
      may be in a given Transit multiple times. Sections are kept
      in order&mdash;the first Section is connected to the second, the
      second is connected to the third, etc. That means a Section
      in a Transit must be connected to the Section before it (if
      there is one) and to the Section after it (if there is one).
      The order of the Sections determines the direction of travel
      in the Transit. Trains travel from Sections with lower
      sequence numbers toward Sections with higher sequence
      numbers. Normally Transits would only be defined for mainline
      track, and sometimes staging yard track.</p>

      <p>In user-specified areas of a Transit, <i>alternate</i>
      Sections may be designated. For example, to move between the
      "2nd" and "4th" Sections in a Transit, there may be multiple
      "3rd" Sections, any of which might be used to travel between
      the 2nd and 4th Sections. Alternate Sections provide for
      passing tracks and staging yards. Transits also provide for
      reverse loops. To provide for back-and-forth running, e.g.
      for trolley cars, an option is provided in Dispatcher to
      automatically reverse the direction of running through a
      Transit when the Train reaches the end of its Transit, and
      have the Train run in reverse to the beginning of its
      Transit.</p>

      <p>Transits support both Manual and Automatic operation of
      Trains. When a Train is running in automatic mode, Transits
      provide for <b>Actions</b> to be activated when the Train
      reaches a designated Section in the Transit. An Action may be
      initiated by a number of events, for example, when the Train
      enters a Section, or when the Train stops. A variety of
      actions are possible, such as pausing the Train for a
      user-designated number of fast clock minutes (a station
      stop), reverting to manual mode for local manual operation,
      or sounding the horn on a sound decoder.</p>

      <h2>How are Transits Activated and Used?</h2>

      <p>Transits are static objects. They specify itineraries for
      Trains to follow around the layout. Transits do not <em>run</em>
      trains, or <em>keep track</em> of running trains.<br>
      A Transit becomes part of the train running process when it is
      <i>activated</i> by being assigned to an <b>Active Train</b>.
      Transits are saved as part of a Panel/Configuration file, only
      need to be set up once, and can be reused.<br>
      Active Trains, on the other hand, are dynamic and transient.
      Active Trains are not saved to disk, and must be set up each
      time they are used.</p>

      <p>Transits are <i>activated</i> in the <a href=
      "../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a> window, where
      a Transit is linked to a Train to create an Active Train.
      When an Active Train is created, a Transit is selected, a
      Train is selected, and a starting Block (Train location at
      start) and ending Block (Train location when travel is
      complete) are specified, along with options. This process
      results in an <b>Active Train</b>, which can then be
      dispatched. A Transit may be used by only one Active Train at
      a time.<br>
      When an Active Train is done, its Transit is<i>deactivated</i>,
      and may be reused for a subsequent Active Train.</p>

      <p>A Train may start from a Block outside of the Transit, but
      connected to a Block within the Transit, or a train may start
      from a Block within a Section in the Transit. A train moves
      through a Transit in only one direction--defined by the order
      in which Sections are included in the Transit. Trains move
      from lower sequence number Sections toward higher sequence
      number Sections. The only exception to this is the
      back-and-forth option that allows a train to run in reverse
      through its Transit back to the beginning of the Transit.</p>

      <p>When an Active Train is initiated, an <i>allocation</i>
      request is placed for a starting Section. If the Section is
      free, the Section will be <i>allocated</i> to the train.
      <i>Allocation</i> means that the Section is assigned the
      Active Train, and the train is authorized by the dispatcher
      to proceed to the end of that Section.</p>

      <p>When an Active Train is created, it may be activated for
      running by an engineer using a throttle, or automatically by
      a <i>virtual engineer</i>. Dispatching consists of
      <i>allocating</i> Sections, one by one, to the Active Train.
      The actual dispatching may be done by a dispatcher sitting at
      the computer running JMRI, or semi-automatically by the
      computer. If a requested Section is currently in use, a
      request for assignment is placed in the dispatcher's queue.
      When a Section is freed, the queue is scanned for the highest
      priority train requesting it.</p>

      <h2>Using the Transit Table to Set Up Transits</h2>

      <p>Transits are set up in the Transit Table. When set up,
      Transits are independent of the Trains that use them.</p>

      <p>All Transits that currently exist can be referenced using
      the <b>Transits</b> tool under <b>Tables</b> in the Tools
      menu of most JMRI programs. There are seven columns in the
      Transit Table:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>System Name</b> - The system name is assigned to the
        Transit when it's created, and can't be changed.</li>

        <li><b>User Name</b> - If you're interested in having your
        Transits carry "human readable" names, you can click in the
        "User Name" column and change that information to whatever
        you want.</li>

        <li><b>State</b> - The state of a Transit tells whether a
        section is <b>IDLE</b> (available for activation and
        assignment to a Train), or <b>ASSIGNED</b> (linked to a
        Train to form an Active Train). The state of a newly added
        Transit is always <b>IDLE</b>.</li>

        <li><b>Comment</b> - This column is for your use to record
        any comment you may want to use to keep track of your
        Transits. It is for information only.</li>

        <li>Click the <b>Delete</b> button in a specific row to
        delete the Transit in that row. Use this button with
        caution! Do not delete a running Transit.</li>

        <li>Click the <b>Edit</b> button in a row to view or change
        entered information for a Transit. System name cannot be
        changed. User name may be changed, Sections may be
        redefined, etc. Only one Transit may be edited at a time. A
        Transit may not be edited if another is being created, or
        if the Transit is not in the IDLE state.</li>

        <li>Click the <b>Duplicate</b> button in a row to add
        another Transit identical to this one. Clicking this button
        is similar to clicking the <b>Add...</b> button (see below)
        except the information from this Transit is copied into the
        Add/Edit Transit window. This option offers an easy way to
        enter multiple copies of a Transit when multiple Trains
        must follow the same route at the same time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To define a new Transit, click the <b><a href=
      "TransitAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a></b> button. An Add/Edit
      Transit window will be brought up that will allow you to
      designate the Sections in the new Transit. (Obviously,
      Sections must be defined before any Transit can be created.)
      Since a Transit may be used in only one Active Train at a
      time, the Duplicate option (see above) may save time when
      creating multiple copies of the same Transit.</p>

      <h3>Using the Layout Editor to Set Up Transits</h3>
      If you are using a
      <a href="../display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor</a>
      Panel to define and generate the Logic for
      Signal Masts and Sections, it is possible to create a basic
      Transit from the Layout Editor. To do this, bring up the
      context menu (right-click) of a Signal Mast on the panel. If
      things have been set up correctly you will see the option to
      <b>Create Transit From Here</b>. After selecting that option
      you can progress along your route and select each facing
      Signal Mast, bringing up the context menu on each and
      selecting <b>Add to Transit</b>. When you are at the final
      destination Signal Mast on your route, select <b>Add to Transit
      and Complete</b> in the context menu of that last Signal Mast.
      <br>
      Please note that you will have to manually save the Transits
      to disk (see below).

      <h2>Setting up for Continuous Running</h2>

      <p>A Transit may be set up for continuous running, allowing
      an Active Train to travel through its Transit multiple times
      without being terminated and re-activated. Provided its
      Transit is set up for continuous running, each time an Active
      Train completes traveling through its Transit, the Active
      Train optionally may be automatically reset by
      <a href="../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a> so
      it is ready to run through its Transit again. For continuous
      running, an Active Train must start and end in the same
      Section, and must be pointed in the same direction when
      starting and when ending. For a Transit to be capable of
      continuous running, its first Section and its last Section
      must be the same, and both must be set up for running in the
      same direction. This applies to both Manual and Automatic
      running of Trains.<br>
      For more information on setting the continuous running option,
      visit the <a href="../dispatcher/NewTrain.shtml">Activate New
      Train</a> Help.</p>

      <h2>Specifying Actions for Automatic Running</h2>

      <p>Transits support a variety of
      <b><a href="ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a></b> that
      automatically happen when a Train is run through the Transit
      in Automatic mode. One or more <b>Actions</b> may be
      specified with each Section in the Transit. <b>Action</b> are
      initiated when their associated Section in the Transit is
      entered by the Automatically run Train.<br>
      Each <b>Action</b> has two parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <i>When</i> part, that specifies when the <b>Action</b>
        is to be performed, and</li>
        <li>a <i>What</i> part, that specifies what <b>Action</b> task
        is to be performed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A commonly used Action, for example, is "When the
      train starts, turn on its headlight." More information on
      Actions is located in the Actions.
      Read <a href="ViewSpecialActions.shtml">more on Actions</a>.</p>

      <h2>Saving Transits to Disk</h2>

      <p>Use the Store item in the File menu to save Transit
      information to disk. This information is saved with the
      configuration in an XML file, along with control panel setup
      and similar items. To store your panels in the same file
      (recommended), select <b>File</b> -&gt; <b>Store &gt; Store
      Configuration and Panels To File...</b> or select <b>Panels
      &gt; Store panels...</b> in the main JMRI window.</p>
