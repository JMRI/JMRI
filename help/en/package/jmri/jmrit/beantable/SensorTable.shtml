      <h1>The Sensor Table</h1>

      <p>The Sensor Table contains a list of the Sensors that exist
      for this Panel.</p>

      <h2>Sensor Table Columns</h2>
      (You may change the order of the columns by dragging their titles,
      and sort the rows by clicking one of the sort triangles next to a column title)
      <dl>
        <dt>User Name</dt>

        <dd>You can directly enter or change the "User Name" for an
        existing Sensor (double click in the cell).</dd>

        <dt>State</dt>

        <dd>Pushing the "State" button/icon will change the
        state of an existing Sensor.

        Choose between textual and graphic display of the Sensor state
        in the <a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Display">Display preferences</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Delete</dt>

        <dd>
          Pushing the "Delete" button will remove the Sensor from
          the table.
          <br>Note that this doesn't remove the Sensor from any
          files you've saved that contain it. If you load one of
          those files, perhaps when you restart the program, the
          Sensor will reappear. You should use one of the "Store to
          file" options in the "File" menu to save new versions of
          any files that contain this Sensor.
        </dd>

        <dt>Inverted</dt>

        <dd>When checked, the Sensor command and status is
        inverted. For example, an inverted Sensor means that when
        the layout sends an "Active" Sensor command, the Sensor
        becomes "Inactive" to JMRI.</dd>

        <dt>Use Global Delays</dt>

        <dd>
          When checked, the Sensor will use the system values
          specified in the "Defaults &gt; Global Debounce Delays..."
          menu option for the duration which the system waits
          before it registers the change of state.
          <br>See <a href="#Debounce">Sensor Debounce Delay</a> below.
        </dd>

        <dt>Delay to Active/to Inactive</dt>

        <dd>
          Specify the amount of time in milliseconds that the
          system waits before registering the state change of a
          Sensor to either state.
          <br>See <a href="#Debounce">Sensor Debounce Delay</a> below.</br>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Sensor Table Controls</h2>
      <p>Along the bottom of the Sensor Table pane are buttons and checkboxes
      that control its operation.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Add...</dt>

        <dd>Push this button to add a new Sensor. For more
        information see <a href=
        "SensorAddEdit.shtml">Adding/Editing Sensors</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Show Debounce Delay Information</dt>

        <dd>When checked, the optional <a href=
        "#Debounce">Delay</a> columns are shown.</dd>

        <dt>Show Pull-Up/-Down Information</dt>

        <dd>When checked, the optional <a href=
        "SensorAddEdit.shtml#pullup">Pull-Up/-Down</a> columns are shown.</dd>

        <dt>Show State Query actions</dt>

        <dd>When checked, an optional Sensor State "Query" and "Forget"
        button is shown for each Sensor.</dd>

        <dt>Defaults menu</dt>

        <dd><p>The "<a href="#Debounce">Global Debounce Delays...</a>" menu
        lets item you configure default values for both delays.</p>
        <p>The "Initial Sensor State" menu item lets you choose what state
        Internal Sensors will display after startup.</p>
        </dd>

      </dl>

      <a name="Debounce" id="Debounce"></a><h2>Sensor Debounce Delays</h2>

      <a href="images/SensorGlobalDelayPane.png"><img
      src="images/SensorGlobalDelayPane.png" height="100" width="317"
      align="right" alt="Sensor Global Debounce Delays edit pane"></a>
      <p>The Debounce Delay facility is there to help prevent
      false triggers of a Sensor being passed into the system and
      triggering other events in the system.<br>
      Such false triggers could be due to a dirty piece of track or
      electrical interference.</p>

      <p>Debounce Delays, activated from the Sensor Table "Defaults
      &gt; Global Debounce Delays..."
      menu, allows you to assign a period in milliseconds
      before the change is registered with the rest of the system.
      If within that period the state has not changed, the Sensor
      state will be passed on to the rest the of the system.<br>
      However if the Sensors state is different after the timer has
      finished, then the system will restart the process. This
      time, after the timer has finished it will check to see if
      the Sensor is in the same state as it was before it restarted
      the process. If not, the process is re-started again until
      the state is the same before and after the timer is run.<br>
      You can set different delays for a change to Inactive and a
      change to Active.</p>
