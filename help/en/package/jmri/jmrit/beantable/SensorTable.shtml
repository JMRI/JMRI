      <h1>The Sensor Table</h1>

      <p>The Sensor Table contains a list of the Sensors that exist
      for this Panel.</p>

      <h2>Sensor Table Columns</h2>

      <p class="im">
      <img src="images/SensorTableColumnList.jpg" alt="Sensor Table Columns (Rel 4.20)" align="right" height="260" width="180">
      Contents of the Sensor Table are displayed by selecting it under <strong>Tools&rArr;Tables</strong>.
      As with all JMRI tool tables, you can add or remove columns from the display by right-clicking anywhere
      in the column header and selecting or deselecting the desired columns from the menu that appears (see picture at right;
      some columns can also be selected by checkboxes at bottom of the main Sensor Table window).
      You can change the order of the columns by dragging their titles, change the width of columns by dragging the vertical line
      between columns, and sort the rows by clicking the column title (a triangle will appear indicating the direction of the sort).
      </p>
       
      <p>The Sensor Table window will display two types of columns: sensor information (information about an individual sensor)
      and button columns (clickable buttons to affect the sensor or the sensor table entry). 

      <h3>Sensor Information</h3>      
       
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>System Name</strong></dt>

        <dd>
        Prefix corresponding to hardware type with suffix you assign when sensor is created. Cannot be changed once created.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>User Name</strong></dt>

        <dd>
        You can directly enter or change the "User Name" for an existing Sensor (double click in the cell).
        </dd>
        
        <dt><strong>State</strong></dt>

        <dd>
        Clicking the "State" text or icon will change the state of an existing Sensor. Choose between textual and graphic
        display of the Sensor state in the <a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Display">Display preferences</a>.
        Note thae value of State is not stored when you close JMRI, even when you use one of the "Store to file" options.
        <br><img src="images/SensorTableGraphic.png" height="187" width="307" align="right" alt="Graphic Sensor state column">
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Comment</strong></dt>

        <dd>
        Any additional information you want to provide.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Inverted</strong></dt>

        <dd>When checked, the Sensor command and status is
        inverted. For example, an inverted Sensor means that when
        the layout sends an "Active" Sensor command, the Sensor
        becomes "Inactive" to JMRI.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Use Global Delays</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          When checked, the Sensor will use the system values
          specified in the "Defaults &gt; Global Debounce Delays..."
          menu option for the duration which the system waits
          before it registers the change of state.
          <br>See <a href="#Debounce">Sensor Debounce Delay</a> below.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Delay to Active/to Inactive</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          Specify the amount of time in milliseconds that the
          system waits before registering the state change of a
          Sensor to either state.  See <a href="#Debounce">Sensor Debounce Delay</a> below.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Pull-Up/-Down</strong></dt>

        <dd>Some hardware connections (such as <a href="../../../../html/hardware/XBee/index.shtml">Digi XBee</a>) allow the user to choose whether
        sensor inputs are set by that hardware as electrically "pulled down (low)" or "pulled up (high)" or neither. If you are using such a connection
        and want JMRI to tell the hardware to set its pull up/pull down, select <strong>Edit</strong> to set this field. If your hardware doesn't have
        this capability (or you don't know), leave the default (<strong>No Pull-up/Pull-down</strong>).  More information may be available in help pages
        for specific <a href="../../../../html/hardware/index.shtml">hardware</a> or on manufacturers' web sites.
        </dd>
      </dl>


      <h3>Button Columns</h3>
       
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Delete</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          Pushing the "Delete" button will remove the Sensor from
          the table.
          <br>Note that this doesn't remove the Sensor from any
          files you've saved that contain it. If you load one of
          those files, perhaps when you restart the program, the
          Sensor will reappear. You should use one of the "Store to
          file" options in the "File" menu to save new versions of
          any files that contain this Sensor.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Edit</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          Pushing the "Edit" button will bring up an edit window where you can change any of the information
          about this particular sensor. Clicking "Apply" or "Ok" save this information as long as JMRI remains
          open.  You must use one of the "Store to file" options in the "File" menu to save this new information
          in a file to be used after JMRI is closed.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Query</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          Pushing the "Query" button will query the hardware "known state" and put that in the 
          Sensor state column.         
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Forget</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          Pushing the "Forget" button will reset the Sensor state to "Unknown."
        </dd>



      </dl>  

      
      <h3>Sensor Table Display Controls</h3>
      <p>Along the bottom of the Sensor Table pane are buttons and checkboxes that control the display of
      the indicated columns.  Note that the display of these columns can also be changed by right-clicking 
      on the column headers and selecting or deselecting columns.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Add...</strong></dt>

        <dd>A window to add a new Sensor will open when you press this button. For more information see 
        <a href="SensorAddEdit.shtml">Adding/Editing Sensors</a>.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Show Debounce Delay Information</strong></dt>

        <dd>When checked, the optional <a href=
        "#Debounce">Delay</a> columns are shown.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Show Pull-Up/Down Information</strong></dt>

        <dd>When checked, the optional <a href="SensorAddEdit.shtml#pullup">Pull-Up/Down</a> columns are shown.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Show State Query actions</strong></dt>

        <dd>When checked, an optional Sensor State "Query" and "Forget" button is shown for each Sensor.</dd>
        
       </dl>

       <p>The word <strong>Defaults</Strong> appears on the window's menu bar.  Clicking it brings up two options:       

      <dl>
      <dt><strong>Global Debouce</strong><dt> 

       <dd>The "<a href="#Debounce">Global Debounce Delays...</a>" menu
        lets item you configure default values for both delays.  See below.</dd>
        
       <dt><strong>Initial Sensor State</strong> (for Internal Sensors ONLY)
       <dd>The "Initial Sensor State" menu item lets you choose what state Internal Sensors (system name beginning with
       "IS") will display after JMRI startup. [Note that the initial state of other sensors cannot be set directly by JMRI, 
       although you can use a <a href="../../../../html/tools/scripting/index.shtml">script</a> to set them.
       </dd>
      </dl>
      
      <p>There is another sensor table display default available from the <strong>Edit&rArr;Preferences&rArr;Display</strong>
      available on the main window. Check to display icons for sensor state instead of text.
      

      <h2><a name="Debounce" id="Debounce">Sensor Debounce Delays</a></h2>

      <a href="images/SensorGlobalDelayPane.png"><img

      align="right" alt="Sensor Global Debounce Delays edit pane"></a>
      
      <p>The Sensor Debounce Delay helps prevent false triggers of a Sensor being passed into the system and
      triggering other events in the system.</p>
        
      <p>Debounce Delays, activated from the Sensor Table "Defaults
      &gt; Global Debounce Delays..."
      menu, allows you to assign a period in milliseconds
      before any sensor change is registered with the rest of the system.
      See <a href="../../../../html/tools/Sensors.shtml#Debounce"> for general info on debounce.</a></p>
