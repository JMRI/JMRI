      <h1>Adding Blocks</h1>

      <p>To add a new Block, click the <strong>Add&hellip;</strong> button at the bottom left edge of
      the Block Table pane.</p>

      <img src="images/BlockAdd.png" alt="Block editing pane">

      <p>In the pane that opens, enter a valid System Name for the Block and if desired enter a
      User Name. Blocks are "internal" objects with a system name prefix of IB.  While the user
      name is optional, if the block is going to be used as a block for Layout Editor track, it must
      have a user name. User names are also required if "Automatically generate System Name" is
      enabled.  Both names must be unique within the Block table. See the "<a href=
      "../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Names</a>" Help page for more information.</p>

      <p>Click [Create] to complete this step. Click [Cancel] to close the pane (don't worry,
      already created items will stay).</p>

      <p>Complete the definition of the new Block by closing the Add New Block pane and clicking
      the <strong>Edit</strong> button at the right of the newly created Block entry in the
      <a href="BlockTable.shtml">Block Table</a>.<br>
      Fill out all fields as described on the <a href="BlockEdit.shtml">Block Attributes</a> Help
      page.</p>

      <h2>Creating a Number of Blocks</h2>

      <p>It is also possible to create a number of Blocks in one go.<br>
      Where supported, the "Add a sequential range" check box will be enabled.</p>

      <p>Checking the "Add a sequential range" box will enable the "Number of items" field. Set the
      number of Blocks that you wish to add. Clicking [Create] will create a number of sequentially
      numbered Blocks.<br>
      If a User Name has been entered, a number will be added to the end of that name (starting by
      #2) to keep each Block User Name unique.</p>

      <h2>Adding Block Properties</h2>

      <p>To add the details of a new Block, close the Add Block pane by clicking Cancel or the
      Close/X button and click <strong><a href="BlockEdit.shtml">Edit</a></strong> to the right of
      the new entry in the Block Table.</p>

      <p>See <a href="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Names</a> under General Help for
      more information on JMRI object naming.</p>
