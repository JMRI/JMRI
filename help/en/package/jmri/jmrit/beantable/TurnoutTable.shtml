<H1>The Turnouts Table</H1>

<P>This table contains a list of all Turnouts that exist for this
Panel. From this table you can change the state of a Turnout, change the
feedback mode, enter Sensors for feedback, invert, lock, and delete it.

<H3>Turnouts Table Columns</H3>

<DL>
	<DT>System Name</DT>
	<DD>The System Name cannot be changed once entered into the table.
	The "Add..." button located in the lower left corner of the pane allows
	you to add a new Turnout to the table. The System Name is automatically
    generated when using the "Add" button.
    <br>See <A HREF="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Names</A>
	for more info about the format.</DD>

	<DT>User Name</DT>
	<DD>You can directly enter or change the "User Name" for an
	existing Turnout. This can be pretty much anything you wish to describe
	the Turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Cmd</DT>
	<DD>Pushing the "Cmd" command button will change the state of an
	existing Turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Delete</DT>
	<DD>Pushing the "Delete" button will remove the Turnout from the
	table. 
	<p>
	Note that this doesn't remove the Turnout from any files you've
	saved that contain it.  If you load one of those files, perhaps
	when you restart the program, the Turnout will reappear.
	You should use one of the "Store to file" options in the "File"
	menu to save new versions of any files that contain this Turnout.
	</DD>


	<DT>Inverted</DT>
	<DD>When checked, the Turnout command and status to and from the
	layout is inverted. For example, an inverted Turnout means that when
	JMRI sends a "CLOSE" turnout command, it becomes a "THROW" to the
	layout. Turnouts that can not be inverted have grayed out boxes and can
	not be checked.</DD>

	<DT>Locked</DT>
	<DD>When checked, the Turnout is locked. There are two types of
	locks supported by JMRI: Cab lockout and Pushbutton lockout. When a
	Turnout is locked, only Turnout commands from JMRI will move the
	Turnout. Cabs and/or pushbuttons on the layout are disabled. You can
	decide for each Turnout if you want "Both" cabs and pushbuttons locked,
	"Cabs only", or "Pushbuttons only". Click the "Show lock information"
	box on the lower edge of the pane to see the lock options. Not all
	stationary decoders support pushbutton lockout, and not all systems
	support cab lockout. Turnouts that can not be locked have grayed out
	boxes and can not be checked. See <A HREF="#Turnout lock feature">Turnout
	lock feature</A> below.</DD>

	<DT>Feedback</DT>
	<DD>This shows the known state of a Turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Mode</DT>
	<DD>The pull down boxes allow you to select the method of
	operation for a Turnout. See <A HREF="#Turnout Feedback">Turnout
	Feedback</A> below.</DD>

	<DT>Sensor 1</DT>
	<DD>Shows the system name of the optional Sensor that provides the
	feedback for a Turnout. You can also directly enter or change the
	system name of Sensor 1 for a Turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Sensor 2</DT>
	<DD>Shows the system name of the optional Sensor that provides the
	feedback for a Turnout. You can also directly enter or change the
	system name of Sensor 2 for a Turnout.</DD>

    <DT>Automate</DT>
    <DD>Shows if an specific retry methods have been configured
    for this Turnout.  See the section on 
    <A HREF="#automation">Turnout Automation</a> below.
    
	<DT><A NAME="Lock Mode"></A>Lock Mode</DT>
	<DD>Shows which lockouts, if any, are active for this Turnout.
	"Both" means that cabs and pushbuttons will be locked out if the lock
	is active. "Cabs only" means that cabs will be locked out, but
	pushbuttons will continue to work when the lock is active. And
	"Pushbuttons only" means that pushbuttons will be locked out, but cabs
	will continue to work when the lock is active. Note, when JMRI locks a
	Turnout's pushbutton, it does so by sending a lock command to the
	Turnout decoder's lock control CV register. You must unlock the Turnout
	before shutting down the JMRI program if you want to restore the
	operation of the pushbuttons. Cab lockout automatically terminates when
	the JMRI program is shut down. For more information on this, <A
		HREF="#Turnout lock feature">see below</A>.</DD>

	<DT><a name="decodercol">Decoder</a></DT>
	<DD>When you're using the lock feature, the program needs to know
	what type of DCC decoder is in use so it can handle it properly. If
	you're not using the lock feature, don't bother with this field; JMRI
	is capable of commanding any type of accessory decoder to move back and
	forth.
	<P>Currently the program only supports lock mode for NCE revision C
	and CVP accessory decoders. CVP decoders support one or two pushbutton
	operation. Select the number of pushbuttons used to operate that
	specific turnout. <code>CVP_AD4_1B</code> means one button, and <code>CVP_AD4_2B</code> means two
	buttons. We recommend that you enter all four CVP Turnouts per decoder
	into the Turnouts table, even if you're only locking one. You do not
	need to specify the number of pushbuttons for NCE. Unfortunately, NCE
	revisions A and B accessory decoders do not support pushbutton lockout.</P>
	</DD>
    <DT><a name="speeds">Closed and Thrown Speed</a></DT>
    <DD>The closed and thrown speed is used with certain automation tools and logic, 
    to help determine the speed at which a Train can be set through the Turnout 
    when it is set to different states.  It is also used by the Signal Mast Logic for
    determining which aspect should be displayed on a Signal Mast.
    <P>In the drop down list, you are presented a set of named fixed speeds that
    have been predefined in the <code>signalSpeed.xml</code> file, in addition to a global and
    use block speed options.<br>In addition it is also possible to enter a 
    numerical value to represent a speed.
    <p>The global value is set via the <b>Speeds</b> menu option.
    <p>When "Use Block Speed" is selected this in effect tells any automation
    tool to ignore the speed setting through this Turnout, the tool should then
    only consider speeds that are set on Blocks.
    </DD>
</DL>

<H3>Turnouts Table Controls</H3>

There are some buttons and checkboxes along the bottom of the 
Turnouts Table pane that control its operation.
<DL>	
    <DT>Add...</DT>
	<DD>Pressing this button opens a window where you can
	<a href="TurnoutAddEdit.shtml">add a new Turnout</a>.</DD>

	<DT>Show feedback information</DT>
	<DD>When checked, the optional Feedback columns are shown.</DD>

	<DT>Show lock information</DT>
	<DD>When checked, the optional Lock columns are shown.</DD>

	<DT>Automatic retry</DT>
	<DD>When checked, enables the automate Global Default setting for
	Turnouts. Currently the Global Default does not cause retries for
	Turnouts. See the section on <A HREF="#automation">Turnout
	Automation</a> below for more information.</DD>

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="Turnout Feedback"></A>Turnout Feedback</H3>

<P>Model railroaders want different things when it comes to knowing
the status of the turnouts on their layout. Some are quite happy to say
"I told it to move, that's good enough for me". These people don't worry
about whether a turnout on their layout actually moved when they told it
to. Those people can just ignore this page, and leave the JMRI settings
at their default.</P>

<P>But some modelers want to have better information about the
status of the turnouts on their layout, and so use some form of
"feedback" to indicate turnout position. This could be as complicated as
two microswitches, adjusted to only close when the turnout is properly
seated in either position. Or it could be something simpler.</P>
<P>In the JMRI program, Turnout objects actually know about two
different states: "Commanded" state and "Known" state. The commanded
state is "This is what was asked for last". The known state is "This is
what's happening on the layout as far as I know".</P>
<P>Built into NCE, LocoNet and XPressNet systems are limited
abilities to monitor what is happening on their networks. This allows
JMRI to capture messages or poll the system concerning Turnout state
changes. All the other protocols normally use a "you told it to change,
so it did" logic. In other words, when something in the code (the
Turnout Control Tool or a script) commands a state change from closed to thrown,
the default is for both both the commanded state and the known state to
change to "Thrown".</P>
<P>But it is also possible to control this in more detail if you
have wired your layout to allow it.</P>
<P>The whole question of Turnout feedback is then "How do we
configure the program to understand the known state properly, given my
layout hardware?"</P>
<P>In the Turnouts pane (Tools -> Tables -> Turnouts) click on the box
in the lower left that is labeled "Show feedback information". Now
expand the Turnouts table pane and you'll find four columns associated
with feedback:</P>
<DL>
	<DT>"Feedback"</DT>
	<DD>This is the "known state". You can't change it, but this
	column will show you what the program thinks it is.</DD>

	<DT>"Mode"</DT>
	<DD>This is the feedback method used by this Turnout. (You can
	change it for each Turnout individually, but note the change doesn't
	take effect until you click somewhere else, and you might need to add
	some Sensor names in the next column(s))</DD>

	<DT>"Sensor 1", "Sensor 2"</DT>
	<DD>These define the Sensors needed by certain types of feedback.
	You can type a Sensor number, System Name or User Name here; the
	program will change it to the System Name that it needs.</DD>
</DL>

<P>Available feedback modes are:</P>
<DL>
	<DT>DIRECT</DT>
	<DD>The default in many cases.
	When something tells the Turnout to change, it's just
	immediately assumed that it actually did it.</DD>

	<DT>ONESENSOR</DT>
	<DD>The Turnout watches the Sensor defined by the "Sensor 1"
	column, which is probably hooked to a microswitch on the turnout or
	similar. When the Sensor is "Active", the turnout is known to be in the
	"Thrown" position. When it's "Inactive", the turnout is known to be in
	the "Closed" position.</DD>

	<DT>TWOSENSOR</DT>
	<DD>The Turnout watches two Sensors defined by the "Sensor 1" and
	"Sensor 2" columns, which are probably hooked to microswitches at
	either end of the turnout's throw bar. When Sensor 1 is "Active", the
	turnout is known to be "Thrown". When Sensor 2 is "Active", the turnout is
	known to be "Closed" (normal).</DD>

	<DT>MONITORING</DT>
	<DD>Default for LocoNet Turnouts (and probably XpressNet soon),
	and available for NCE. When selected, the network is monitored for
	messages about the status of the Turnout. This mode is only available
	for certain systems, i.e. some systems can't do the monitoring
	properly, and don't have this choice.</DD>

	<DT>INDIRECT</DT>
	<DD>Currently only available for LocoNet Turnouts, this informs
	the program that the turnout is being driven by a Digitrax DS54 with a
	microswitch attached to the switch lead. For more information, see the
	<A HREF="../../../../html/hardware/loconet/DS54.shtml">DS54</A>
	examples page.</DD>

	<DT>EXACT</DT>
	<DD>Currently only available for LocoNet Turnouts, this informs
	the program that the turnout is being driven by a Digitrax DS54 with
	two microswitches attached to the switch and aux leads. For more
	information, see the
	<A HREF="../../../../html/hardware/loconet/DS54.shtml">DS54</A>
	examples page on the JMRI website.</DD>

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="automation"></A>Turnout Automation</H3>

JMRI can watch a Turnout and automate certain operations on it.
This was originally added to handle the case of "I usually have to 
click that turnout a couple times to get it to throw over", but
it can be used for other things too.
<p>
The three forms are:
<dl>
<dt>No Feedback<dd>This just repeats the messages a fixed number of
times, with a delay in between.
<dt>Sensor<dd>This repeats the messages, with
a delay in between, until either the Sensor feedback indicates the
turnout has moved or a limit on the number of attempts is reached.
<dt>Raw<dd>This sends raw DCC packets to command the turnout to 
move over, instead of working through the usual
mechanisms for the specific system. 
This mode is intended as a way of getting around certain kinds of incompatibility
between DCC components. 
(Note: This is not available with MONITORING feedback, because
that relies on system-specific messages that aren't used in this  mode.
It's also not available for systems that don't have a DCC command station present
to send the raw messages)

</dl>
<p>
Normally, turnouts only throw once, which is the "Off" setting
under "Automate". You can set a Turnout to 
use "No Feedback" automation by selecting it in the Automate
column for the individual Turnout.  If there are feedback Sensors
defined, you can also select the "Sensor" method there.
<p>
You can customize the automation by selecting "Edit..."
for an individual Turnout.
<p>
It's also possible to set global defaults, and some Turnouts use
those.  See the "Automate" menu to edit those defaults.


<H3><A NAME="Turnout lock feature"></A>Turnout Lock feature</H3>

<P>The Turnout Lock feature allows you to selectively disable
accessory (Turnouts) commands from cabs and/or locally-wired
pushbuttons. The Lock can be set (Locked) or unset (Unlocked) from a
checkbox in the Turnouts Table, from a <A HREF="RouteAddEdit.shtml#lock">Route</A>
or Logix, or from scripts.</P>

<H4>Cab Lockout</H4>
To do the Cab Lockout, JMRI works with the DCC system to prevent people
from changing the position of a locked Turnout. JMRI can only do this
with some DCC systems. To do it, the JMRI program monitors the Turnout's
accessory address and if it detects a change command from a Cab, will
cancel the command by immediately sending out the opposite command to
the Turnout.

<P>To use this feature with an NCE command station, you must select
MONITORING as the feedback mode for the Turnout and the NCE command
station must have the 2007 or newer EPROM.</P>

<H4>Pushbutton Lockout</H4>
JMRI can also work with certain types of DCC accessory decoders to lock
out their locally-wired pushbuttons. To do this, JMRI sends DCC commands
to the decoder. These commands are decoder-type specific, so the program
needs to know what type of accessory decoder operates each lockable
Turnout. (There is no industry standard for the "Lock" messages, unlike
for the messages to move the turnout back and forth, so we have to
create the right custom ones for each type.) The various types are
selected in the
<A HREF="#decodercol">"Decoder" column</A>
of the Turnouts Table.

<H4>Locking Routes</H4>
To help you select a set of Turnouts to lock, a Route can also be
locked. All Turnouts that are being monitored by the JMRI program and
are included in the Route will be locked. See the <A
	HREF="RouteTable.shtml">Routes page</A> for more information on this.
