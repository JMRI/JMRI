      <h1>The Turnout Table</h1>

      <p>This table contains a list of all Turnouts that exist for
      this Panel. From this table you can change the state of a
      Turnout, change the feedback mode, enter Sensors for
      feedback, invert, lock, and delete it. <a name="columns" id=
      "columns"></a></p>

      <h2>Turnout Table Columns</h2>
      (You may change the order of the columns by dragging their titles,
      and sort the rows by clicking one of the sort triangles next to a column title)
      <dl>
        <dt>System Name</dt>

        <dd>The System Name cannot be changed once entered into the
        table. The <a href="TurnoutAddEdit.shtml">"Add..."</a>
        button located in the lower left corner
        of the pane allows you to add a new Turnout to the table.
        The System Name is automatically generated when using the
        "Add..." button.<br>
        See <a href=
        "../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Names</a> for
        more info about the format.</dd>

        <dt>User Name</dt>

        <dd>You can directly enter or change the "User Name" for an
        existing Turnout (double click in the cell). This can be
        pretty much anything you wish to describe the Turnout.</dd>

        <dt>State</dt>
        <img src="images/TurnoutTableGraphic.png" height="96" width="399"
        align="right" alt="Graphic Turnout state column">
        <img src="images/TurnoutTableText.png" height="140" width="406"
        align="right" alt="Textual Turnout state column">
        <dd>Pushing one of the buttons/icons in the "State" column
        will change the state of that particular Turnout.<br>
        Choose between textual and graphic display of the Turnout state
        in the <a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Display">Display
        preferences</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Delete</dt>

        <dd>
          Pushing the "Delete" button will remove that Turnout from
          the table.

          <p>Note that this doesn't remove the Turnout from any
          files you've saved that contain it. If you load one of
          those files, perhaps when you restart the program, the
          Turnout will reappear. You should use one of the "Store
          to file" options in the "File" menu to save new versions
          of any files that contain this Turnout.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Inverted</dt>

        <dd>When checked, the Turnout command and status to and
        from the layout is inverted. For example, an inverted
        Turnout means that when JMRI sends a "CLOSE" turnout
        command, it becomes a "THROW" to the layout. Turnouts that
        can not be inverted have grayed out boxes and can not be
        checked.</dd>

        <dt>Locked</dt>

        <dd>When checked, the Turnout is locked. There are two
        types of locks supported by JMRI: Cab lockout and
        Pushbutton lockout. When a Turnout is locked, only Turnout
        commands from JMRI will move the Turnout. Cabs and/or
        pushbuttons on the layout are disabled. You can decide for
        each Turnout if you want "Both" cabs and pushbuttons
        locked, "Cabs only", or "Pushbuttons only". Click the "Show
        Lock information" box on the lower edge of the pane to see
        the lock options. Not all stationary decoders support
        pushbutton lockout, and not all systems support cab
        lockout. Turnouts that can not be locked have grayed out
        boxes and can not be checked. See <a href=
        "#Turnout%20lock%20feature">Turnout Lock feature</a>
        below.</dd>

        <dt>Edit</dt>

        <dd>Click this button to inspect and set Basic settings,
        Feedback, Lock, Speed, Usage and (custom) Properties of a
        particular Turnout in a tabbed pane.</dd>

        <dt>Feedback</dt>

        <dd>This shows the known state of a turnout on the layout,
        which may differ from the last Cmd sent.</dd>

        <dt>Mode</dt>

        <dd>The pull down boxes allow you to select the method of
        operation for a Turnout. See <a href=
        "#Turnout%20Feedback">Turnout Feedback</a> below.</dd>

        <dt>Sensor 1</dt>

        <dd>Shows the System Name of the optional Sensor that
        provides the feedback for a Turnout. You can also directly
        enter or change the System Name of Sensor 1 for a
        Turnout.</dd>

        <dt>Sensor 2</dt>

        <dd>Shows the System Name of the optional Sensor that
        provides the feedback for a Turnout. You can also directly
        enter or change the System Name of Sensor 2 for a
        Turnout.</dd>

        <dt>Automation</dt>

        <dd>Shows what specific retry method has been configured
        for this Turnout. See the section on <a href=
        "#automation">Turnout Automation</a> below.</dd>

        <dt>Edit Auto</dt>

        <dd>Click this button to set custom retry values for a
        specific turnout. This button is inactive when Automate is
        set to Off or Use Global.</dd>

        <dt><a name="Lock Mode"></a>Lock Mode</dt>

        <dd>Shows which lockouts, if any, are active for this
        Turnout. "Both" means that cabs and pushbuttons will be
        locked out if the Lock is active. "Cabs only" means that
        cabs will be locked out, but pushbuttons will continue to
        work when the Lock is active. And "Pushbuttons only" means
        that pushbuttons will be locked out, but cabs will continue
        to work when the Lock is active. Note, when JMRI locks a
        Turnout's pushbutton, it does so by sending a Lock command
        to the Turnout decoder's lock control CV register. You must
        unlock the Turnout before shutting down the JMRI program if
        you want to restore the operation of the pushbuttons. Cab
        lockout automatically terminates when the JMRI program is
        shut down. For more information on this, see <a href=
        "#Turnout%20lock%20feature">Turnout Lock</a> below.</dd>

        <dt><a name="decodercol" id="decodercol">Decoder</a></dt>

        <dd>
          When you're using the lock feature, the program needs to
          know what type of DCC decoder is in use so it can handle
          it properly. If you're not using the lock feature, don't
          bother with this field; JMRI is capable of commanding any
          type of accessory decoder to move back and forth.

          <p>Currently the program only supports lock mode for NCE
          revision C and CVP accessory decoders. CVP decoders
          support one or two pushbutton operation. Select the
          number of pushbuttons used to operate that specific
          turnout. <code>CVP_AD4_1B</code> means one button, and
          <code>CVP_AD4_2B</code> means two buttons. We recommend
          that you enter all four CVP Turnouts per decoder into the
          Turnout Table, even if you're only locking one. You do
          not need to specify the number of pushbuttons for NCE.
          Unfortunately, NCE revisions A and B accessory decoders
          do not support pushbutton lockout.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><a name="speeds" id="speeds">Closed and Thrown
        Speed</a></dt>

        <dd>
          The closed and thrown speed is used with certain
          automation tools and logic, to help determine the speed
          at which a Train can be set through the Turnout when it
          is set to different states. It is also used by the Signal
          Mast Logic for determining which aspect should be
          displayed on a Signal Mast.

          <p>In the drop down list, you are presented a set of
          named fixed speeds that have been predefined in the
          <code>signalSpeed.xml</code> file, in addition to a
          global and use block speed options.<br>
          In addition it is also possible to enter a numerical
          value to represent a speed.</p>

          <p>The global value is set via the <b>Speeds</b> menu
          option.</p>

          <p>When "Use Block Speed" is selected this in effect
          tells any automation tool to ignore the speed setting
          through this Turnout; the tool should then only consider
          speeds that are set on <a href=
          "BlockTable.shtml#BlockSpeed">Blocks</a>.</p>

      <h2><a name="Turnout Feedback"></a>Turnout Feedback</h2>

      <p>Model railroaders want different things when it comes to
      knowing the status of the turnouts on their layout. Some are
      quite happy to say "I told it to move, that's good enough for
      me". These people don't worry about whether a turnout on
      their layout actually moved when they told it to. Those
      people can just ignore this page, and leave the JMRI settings
      at their default.</p>

      <p>But some modelers want to have better information about
      the status of the turnouts on their layout, and so use some
      form of "feedback" to indicate turnout position. This could
      be as complicated as two microswitches, adjusted to only
      close when the turnout is properly seated in either position.
      Or it could be something simpler.</p>

      <p>In the JMRI program, Turnout objects actually know about
      two different states: "Commanded" state and "Known" state.
      The commanded state is "This is what was asked for last". The
      known state is "This is what's happening on the layout as far
      as I know".</p>

      <p>Built into NCE, LocoNet and XPressNet systems are limited
      abilities to monitor what is happening on their networks.
      This allows JMRI to capture messages or poll the system
      concerning Turnout state changes. All the other protocols
      normally use a "you told it to change, so it did" logic. In
      other words, when something in the code (the Turnout Control
      Tool or a script) commands a state change from closed to
      thrown, the default is for both both the commanded state and
      the known state to change to "Thrown".</p>

      <p>But it is also possible to control this in more detail if
      you have wired your layout to allow it.</p>

      <p>The whole question of Turnout feedback is then "How do we
      configure the program to understand the known state properly,
      given my layout hardware?"</p>

      <p>In the Turnouts pane (Tools -&gt; Tables -&gt; Turnouts)
      click on the box near the bottom that is labeled "Show
      feedback information". To the right of the Turnouts pane
      you'll find four extra columns associated with feedback:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>"Feedback"</dt>

        <dd>This is the "known state". You can't change it, but
        this column will show you what the program thinks it
        is.</dd>

        <dt>"Mode"</dt>

        <dd>This is the feedback method used by this Turnout. (You
        can change it for each Turnout individually, but note the
        change doesn't take effect until you click somewhere else,
        and you might need to add some Sensor names in the next
        column(s))</dd>

        <dt>"Sensor 1", "Sensor 2"</dt>

        <dd>These define the Sensors needed by certain types of
        feedback. You can type a Sensor number, System Name or User
        Name here; the program will change it to the System Name
        that it needs.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Available Feedback modes are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>DIRECT</dt>

        <dd>The default in many cases. When something tells the
        Turnout to change, it's just immediately assumed that it
        actually did it.</dd>

        <dt>ONESENSOR</dt>

        <dd>The Turnout watches the Sensor defined by the "Sensor
        1" column, which is probably hooked to a microswitch on the
        turnout or similar. When the Sensor is "Active", the
        turnout is known to be in the "Thrown" position. When it's
        "Inactive", the turnout is known to be in the "Closed"
        position.</dd>

        <dt>TWOSENSOR</dt>

        <dd>The Turnout watches two Sensors defined by the "Sensor
        1" and "Sensor 2" columns, which are probably hooked to
        microswitches at either end of the turnout's throw bar.
        When Sensor 1 is "Active", the turnout is known to be
        "Thrown". When Sensor 2 is "Active", the turnout is known
        to be "Closed" (normal).</dd>

        <dt>DELAYED</dt>

        <dd>When something tells the Turnout to change, 
        it immediately starts the operation and goes to
        the INCONSISTENT state to reflect that the points
        are moving.  After a few seconds delay, the
        operation completes and the final state is reported.</dd>

        <dt>MONITORING</dt>

        <dd>Default for LocoNet Turnouts (and probably XpressNet
        soon), and available for NCE. When selected, the network is
        monitored for messages about the status of the Turnout.
        This mode is only available for certain systems, i.e. some
        systems can't do the monitoring properly, and don't have
        this choice.</dd>

        <dt>INDIRECT</dt>

        <dd>Currently only available for LocoNet Turnouts, this
        informs the program that the turnout is being driven by a
        Digitrax DS54 with a microswitch attached to the switch
        lead. For more information, see the <a href=
        "../../../../html/hardware/loconet/DS54.shtml">DS54</a>
        examples page.</dd>

        <dt>EXACT</dt>

        <dd>Currently only available for LocoNet Turnouts, this
        informs the program that the turnout is being driven by a
        Digitrax DS54 with two microswitches attached to the switch
        and aux leads. For more information, see the <a href=

      </dl>

      <h2><a name="automation" id="automation"></a>Turnout
      Automation</h2>

      <p>JMRI can watch a Turnout and automate certain operations
      on it. This was originally added to handle the case of "I
      usually have to click that turnout a couple times to get it
      to throw over", but it can be used for other things too.</p>

      <p>The three forms are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>No Feedback</dt>

        <dd>This just repeats the messages a fixed number of times,
        with a delay in between.</dd>

        <dt>Sensor</dt>

        <dd>This repeats the messages, with a delay in between,
        until either the Sensor feedback indicates the turnout has
        moved or a limit on the number of attempts is reached.</dd>

        <dt>Raw</dt>

        <dd>This sends raw DCC packets to command the turnout to
        move over, instead of working through the usual mechanisms
        for the specific system. This mode is intended as a way of
        getting around certain kinds of incompatibility between DCC
        components.<br>
        (Note: Raw is not available with MONITORING feedback,
        because that relies on system-specific messages that aren't
        used in this mode. It's also not available for systems that
        don't have a DCC command station present to send the raw
        messages)</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Normally, turnouts are only thrown once, which is the
      "Off" setting under "Automation". You can set a Turnout to
      use "No Feedback" automation by selecting it in the
      Automation column for the individual Turnout. If there are
      feedback Sensors defined, you can also select the "Sensor"
      method there.</p>

      <p>You can customize the automation by clicking "Edit Auto"
      for an individual Turnout.</p>

      <p>It's also possible to set global Automation defaults, and
      some Turnouts use those. Use the Automation -&gt; Edit...
      menu to access those defaults.</p>

      <h2><a name="Turnout lock feature"></a>Turnout Lock
      feature</h2>

      <p>The Turnout Lock feature allows you to selectively disable
      accessory (Turnout) commands from cabs and/or locally-wired
      pushbuttons. The Lock can be set (Locked) or unset (Unlocked)
      from a checkbox in the Turnout Table, from a <a href=
      "RouteAddEdit.shtml#lock">Route</a> or Logix, or from
      scripts.</p>

      <h4>Cab Lockout</h4>
      To do the Cab Lockout, JMRI works with
      the DCC system to prevent people from changing the position
      of a locked Turnout. JMRI can only do this with some DCC
      systems. To do it, the JMRI program monitors the Turnout's
      accessory address and if it detects a change command from a
      Cab, will cancel the command by immediately sending out the
      opposite command to the Turnout.

      <p>To use this feature with an NCE command station, you must
      select MONITORING as the feedback mode for the Turnout and
      the NCE command station must have the 2007 or newer
      EPROM.</p>

      <h4>Pushbutton Lockout</h4>
      JMRI can also work with certain
      types of DCC accessory decoders to lock out their
      locally-wired pushbuttons. To do this, JMRI sends DCC
      commands to the decoder. These commands are decoder-type
      specific, so the program needs to know what type of accessory
      decoder operates each lockable Turnout. (There is no industry
      standard for the "Lock" messages, unlike for the messages to
      move the turnout back and forth, so we have to create the
      right custom ones for each type.) The various types are
      selected in the <a href="#decodercol">"Decoder" column</a> of
      the Turnout Table.

      <h4>Locking Routes</h4>
      To help you select a set of Turnouts
      to lock, a Route can also be locked. All Turnouts that are
      being monitored by the JMRI program and are included in the
      Route will be locked. See the <a href=
      "RouteTable.shtml">Routes help page</a> for more information.
