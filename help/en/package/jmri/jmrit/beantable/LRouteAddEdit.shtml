<H1><A NAME="Adding/Editing LRoutes"></A>Adding/Editing LRoutes</H1>

<p>There are four tabs for adding and editing lroutes:

<H3>Tab 1. Basic LRoute</H3>

<P>The first thing you must do when creating a route is name it. In
the box labeled "System Name" enter a unique name for your lroute.
The prefix "RTX" will be added to the system name, 
You can optionally enter a more descriptive name in the "User
Name" box.</P>

<dl>
<dt>Logix Route Type</dt>
        <dd>The radio buttons below the tab descriptions set the triggering mode 
        for the "veto" control variables (see below for an explanation of veto).
        To emulate the behavior of Routes (as opposed to LRoutes) select the 
        <b>Old</b> option.  (Standard Routes do not not trigger when the veto condition is
        removed.)  If you want the l-route to trigger when the veto condition is 
        removed, select the <b>New</b> option.</dd>
</dl>

The buttons at the bottom of the LRoute Table

<DL>	
<DT>Add Route</DT>
	<DD>Push this button to add a new logix route. </DD>
        
<DT>Cancel</DT>
	<DD>Push this button to cancel editing. </DD>
</DL>

<H3>Tab 2. Actions (output)</H3>

<p>This tab contains a pick list of all the Sensors, Turnouts, Lights and SignalHeads 
that have been created.  Click the checkbox in the <b>Include</b> column to select the 
device you want to include in the l-route.  Then choose the action you want the
device to take when the l-route is triggered from the drop down menu in the <b>Set 
Action</b> column.</p>

<p>The radio buttons allow you to limit the display of devices to only those you
have selected.</p>

<H3>Tab 3. Triggers/Controls (intput)</H3>

<p>This tab contains a pick list of all the Sensors, Turnouts, Lights and SignalHeads 
that have been created.  Click the checkbox in the <b>Include</b> column to select the 
device you want to use to control in the l-route.  Then choose the state you want the
device to use for triggering the l-route from the drop down menu in the <b>Trigger 
State</b> column.</p>

<p>Devices selected with "non-veto" states are grouped as an "OR" clause.  Triggers
selected with a "veto" state are grouped as an "AND" clause.  That is, when any 
"non-veto" state becomes true, the l-route is able to trigger.  However, if any of the
"veto" states is true, the l-route will not trigger.</p>

<p>On Tab 1, the Logix Route Type <b>New</b> will put the above logic into a single
Logix Conditional.  If the <b>Old</b> option is selected, each trigger with a
"non-veto" state is put into a separate Conditional.  The behavior for this
option is the 
l-route will trigger whenever one of these device states becomes true - even when
the logical expression as a whole is already true.  Another difference when
the <b>Old</b> option is specified, is that the "veto" variables are not enabled for triggering.
This means the actions are not triggered when the vetoes are removed.  Use the <b>new</b>
option if you want actions to be triggered when the vetoes are removed.  
In summary, the <b>Old</b> option emulates a standard Route and the <b>New</b> 
option has the behavior of a standard Logix Conditional.  Variations on these behaviors  
can be tuned with further editing in the Logix Table.

<p>Note that control variables selected with "On Change" states need a separate
Logix Conditional in order for the l-route actions to trigger on every change of state
of these variables.  

<p>The radio buttons allow you to limit the display of devices to only those you
have selected.</p>

<H3>Tab 4. Alignment/Locks/Etc.</H3>

<p>This tab contains a pick list of the Sensors 
that have been created.  Click the checkbox in the <b>Include</b> column to select a 
sensor you want to use for indicating completion of the l-route actions.  Then choose
the type of action you want the sensor to monitor from the drop down menu in the  
<b>Alignment</b> column.  You may choose to have the sensor indicate a particular type 
(sensor, turnout, light, signal, or all)</p>

<p>The radio buttons allow you to limit the display of devices to only those you
have selected.</p>

<p>A sound file may be entered to play when the l-route is triggered.  Likewise a script
file may be run when the l-route is triggered.
