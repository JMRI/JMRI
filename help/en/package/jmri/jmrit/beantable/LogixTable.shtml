      <h1>The Logix Table</h1>

      <p>A Logix is a small group of Conditionals focused on a
      single task on the layout. Each Conditional may be viewed as
      a statement of the form:</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        if (logical expression) then (action).
      </div>The "logical expression" part of a Conditional tests
      the state of a group of user-specified conditions on the
      layout, for example, whether certain turnouts are closed or
      thrown, or whether a block is occupied. The "action" part of
      the Conditional specifies what action is to be taken if the
      state of the logical expression changes.

      <p>The Logix Table lists all currently defined Logix by their
      System Name and User Name.</p>

      <h2>Columns in the Logix Table</h2>

      <p>The last column of the table provides three things you can
      do with a Logix; Edit it, Duplicate it, or Delete it. Simply
      clicking <b>Select</b> will drop down a menu with the
      choices: <b>Edit</b>, <b>Copy</b>, <b>Delete</b>. Selecting
      <b>Edit</b> will bring up the Edit Logix window which
      provides away to edit a Logix and its Conditionals. See
      <a href="LogixAddEdit.shtml">the help page on adding
      Logix</a> for more information on creating and editing Logix
      Conditionals.<br>
      Selecting <b>Copy</b> will bring up windows that allow you to
      make a new copy of Logix and its Conditionals or to copy its
      Conditionals into an existing Logix.<br>
      Selecting <b>Delete</b> will delete the Logix and its
      Conditionals.</p>

      <p>The <b>Enabled</b> column allows you to enable (checked)
      or disable (unchecked) a Logix. A Logix does not have a state
      as many JMRI entities do. A Logix does have the capability of
      being "enabled" or "disabled". When a Logix is not enabled,
      the logical expressions of its Conditionals are still
      evaluated, but the actions specified in the Conditionals are
      not taken. When a Logix is enabled after having been
      disabled, its Conditionals are recalculated and appropriate
      actions taken.</p>

      <h2>Creating a Logix</h2>

      <p>To create a new Logix, click the <b>Add...</b> button at
      the bottom of the Logix Table. This will bring up a "Create
      Logix" pane. Entering a System Name and optionally a User
      Name, then clicking <b>Create Logix</b>, will create the
      Logix, and bring up the Edit Logix window. Once a Logix is
      created, its System Name cannot be changed. Its User Name,
      however, may be changed in either the Logix Table or the Edit
      Logix window. A new User Name may be any useful text,
      provided the new User Name was not already assigned to
      another Logix. (See also the <a href=
      "LogixAddEdit.shtml">separate help page on adding Logix</a>
      and a <a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Logix.shtml#start">step-by-step
      guide</a>.)</p>

      <p>The <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Logix Table
      provides for printing this table and for storing the Logixs
      and their Conditionals in a layout configuration file.
      Selecting either store option will bring up a dialog for
      naming a configuration file for writing Logix information and
      all other configuration information (e.g., sensors, lights,
      turnouts, signal heads, routes etc.). If you are updating an
      existing file, simply click its name, and it will be copied
      into the name entry.</p>
