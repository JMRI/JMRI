      <h1>Adding/Editing Sensors</h1>

      <p>When adding a Sensor, from the "System connection:" drop down
      list select the hardware connection this Sensor is
      attached to.</p><img src="images/AddSensor.png">

      <p>Enter a valid address for the Sensor (look at
      the Tooltip for accepted input options per system).
      If desired, enter a User Name which can be anything you
      wish to describe the Sensor.<br>
      Finish by clicking the "OK" button.</p>

      <h2>Creating A Number of Sensors</h2>

      <p>It is also possible to create a number of Sensors in one
      go.<br>
      Where supported the "Add a sequential range" check box will be
      enabled.</p><img src="images/AddSensorNumber.png">

      <p>Checking this box will enable
      the "Number of items" spinner. Click the small arrows
      up or down to set the number of Sensors you wish to add.
      Clicking "OK" will then create that
      number of sequential Sensors in the table.<br>
      If a User Name has been
      entered, a number will be added to the end of the name to
        keep each Sensor User Name unique.</p>

      <h2>Hardware Specific Information</h2>

      <p>Please refer to our
      <a href="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml#entrysummary">summary of allowed entry patterns</a>
      per connection.</p>

      <h3>NCE AIU Number to JMRI Sensor Mapping</h3>
      The NCE
      Auxiliary Input Unit (or AIU) allows the NCE command station
      to check the status of inputs from the layout. These are
      referenced in JMRI as Sensors with names like "NS785". "NS"
      means "NCE Sensor", and "785" is the number of a specific
      Sensor input.

      <p>The hardware address can be entered in two different
      ways:</p>

      <dl>
        <dd>
          <p>Enter in the AIU Cab Address followed by the Pin
          Number separated by a ":"<br>
          So for a sensor on AIU Cab Address 50, pin 2 you would
          enter into the Hardware Address field :<br>
          50:2</p>

          <p>The Sensor number can also be found and entered into
          the hardware address field by using the following
          formula:</p>

          <p>Sensor ID = (AIU Cab Address - 1) * 16 + (Pin Number
          On AIU) -1</p>

          <p>For example: The AIU cab address is set to 50 and one
          of the BD20s is connected to pin 2. Therefore the Sensor
          ID would be:</p>

          <p>Sensor ID = (50 - 1) * 16 + (2) -1</p>

          <p>Sensor ID = 785</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>LocoNet Sensor to JMRI Sensor Mapping</h3>

      <p>LocoNet Sensor addresses are made up from two different
      parts: the Board number and Channel number.<br>
      Sensors can also be configured from the Turnout addresses for
      the Aux &amp; Switch input.</p>

      <p>The hardware address can be entered in a number of
      different ways:</p>

      <dl>
        <dd>
          Enter the board number, followed by the channel number
          separated by a ":"<br>
          So for a Sensor on board 11, channel 1 you would enter
          into the Hardware Address field:<br>
          11:1

          <p>For Sensors attached to Turnouts, you enter into the
          hardware address field "T:" followed by the Turnout
          number. This will add the Aux input associated with the
          Turnout. To add both the Aux and the Switch input, check
          "Add a range" and set the number to add to 2.<br>
          So for a Sensor attached to Turnout 81 you would enter
          the following:<br>
          T:81</p>

          <p>The Other method is to calculate the address of the
          Sensor and add it manually into the hardware address
          field using the following method:</p>

          <p>If you want to calculate the address of a BDL168
          input, you can use<br>
          number = 16 * (board number) + (channel number) - 16</p>

          <p>where "channel number" runs from 1 to 16. For example,
          the first circuit (number 1) on board 11 has number:<br>
          number = 16 * (11) + (1) - 16 = 161</p>as we saw in the
          example above.

          <p>If you want to calculate the address of a DS54 aux
          input, use:<br>
          number = 2 * (turnout number - 1) + 1</p>

          <p>For example, the aux input associated with Turnout 81
          has number:<br>
          number = 2 * (81 - 1) + 1 = 161</p>

          <p>If it's the switch input, you add one more to
          that:<br>
          number = 2 * (turnout number - 1) + 2</p>

          <p>For example, the switch input associated with Turnout
          12 has number:<br>
          number = 2 * ( 12 - 1 ) + 2 = 24</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Lenz XpressNet Sensor to JMRI Sensor Mapping</h3>

      <p>XpressNet Sensor addresses are made up from two different
      parts: the Feedback Encoder address and Contact.</p>

      <p>The hardware address can be entered in a number of
      different ways</p>

      <dl>
        <dd>
          Enter in the encoder address, followed by the contact
          separated by a ":"<br>
          So for a Sensor on Feedback Encoder address 99, Contact 3
          you would enter into the Hardware Address field:<br>
          99:3

          <p>If you wish to calculate the address of the Sensor,
          subtract 1 from the Feedback Encoder's address, multiply
          that result by 8, and then add the input number you are
          using.<br>
          For Example, if you are using Contact 3 on a Feedback
          Encoder with address 99, 99 - 1 = 98. 98*8=784.
          784+3=787.<br>
          The feedback address you will use is 787.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Maple and C/MRI Sensor to JMRI Sensor Mapping</h3>

      <p>Maple and C/MRI sensor addresses are made up from two
      different parts: a Node Id and Pin/Sensor Id.</p>

      <p>The hardware address can be entered in a number of
      different ways:</p>

      <dl>
        <dd>
          Enter the Node Id, followed by the Sensor Id, separated
          by a ":". This method can also be used for the
          alternative/extended addressing.<br>
          So for a Sensor on Node 2, pin 3 you would enter the
          following into the hardware address field:<br>
          2:3

          <p>Another method of adding the Sensor address is to use
          the following formula:</p>Node Id x 1000 + pin.<br>
          So for a Sensor on Node 2, pin 3<br>
          (2x1000)+3 = 2003

          <p>To use the alternative/extended addressing scheme,
          refer to your C/MRI hardware connection guide.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Grapevine Sensor to JMRI Sensor Mapping</h3>There are
      three separate types of Grapevine Sensors:

      <dl>
        <dt>Advanced Serial Detectors</dt>

        <dd>
          Up to three Advanced Serial Detector boards can be
          attached to a Grapevine Node. Each provides eight
          occupancy detectors, and associates a motion detector
          with each of those.

          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Board</th>

              <th>Occupancy</th>

              <th>Motion</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Master</td>

              <td>1-8</td>

              <td>9-16</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Slave 1</td>

              <td>17-24</td>

              <td>25-32</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Slave 2</td>

              <td>33-40</td>

              <td>41-48</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </dd>

        <dt>Original Serial Sensors</dt>

        <dd>Occupancy Sensors on the original serial boards replace
        Sensors attached through advanced boards at addresses 1 to
        8. There are no motion sensors in this case.</dd>

        <dt>Parallel Sensors</dt>

        <dd>The parallel sensors, connectors on the Grapevine node
        itself appear as JMRI sensors 101 to 108 on the node. If
        the optional second bank of serial sensors are present,
        they appear as sensors 109 to 116 on the node.</dd>
