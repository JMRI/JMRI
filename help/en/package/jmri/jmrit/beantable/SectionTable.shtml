<H1>Sections and the Section Table
</H1>
<H2> What is a Section?
</H2>
<P>A <b>Section</b> is a group of one or more connected <b>Blocks</b> that may be 
allocated to a train traveling in a given direction. Sections were created to solve 
the direction problem that can occur when using Blocks directly. A Section has only 
two directions, "forward" or "reverse". Sections can be traversed by a train in either 
direction. Section direction is independent of the direction set for the locomotive by 
a throttle. In addition to solving the direction problem, Sections offer the user 
other useful features.</p>
<p>Sections can be considered an extension of Blocks. Many Sections contain only one 
Block. All Blocks contained in a multi-Block Section must be different. 
Blocks are kept in order--the first block is connected to the second, the second 
is connected to the third, etc. That means a Block in a Section must be connected 
to the Block before it (if there is one) and to the Block after it (if there is 
one), but may not be connected to any other Block in the Section. A Section may 
not contain any reverse loops.</P>
<p>Sections and their associated <b><a href="TransitTable.shtml">Transits</a></b> 
are designed to provide support for dispatching, either manual dispatching (by a 
dispatcher sitting at a panel), or automatic dispatching by the computer. Dispatching 
is the temporary allocation of Sections for the exclusive use of trains, either
run by engineers with a throttle, and/or run automatically by the computer. Support for 
dispatching is provided by <A HREF="../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"><b>Dispatcher</b></a>, 
which also provides for set up and running of trains automatically.</p>
<P>A Section's <b>direction</b> is defined by the sequence in which Blocks are 
added to a multi-Block Section. For a single Block Section the direction is chosen
arbitrarily when the Section is created. A train may run through a Section in either 
the <b>forward</b> direction (from first block to last block) or <b>reverse</b> 
direction (from last block to first block). If a Section has only one Block, the 
<b>direction</b> of that Section is chosen when setting up its <b>Entry Points</b> 
(see below).</p>

<p>Therefore, when setting up multi-block sections, you should choose blocks in the same 
order across the layout for sequentially connected sections.  That way, the forward and 
reverse directions will have consistent meaning for sections on a relative basis</p>

<p>A Section has one or more <b>Entry Points</b>. An Entry Point defines a 
connection from a Block inside the Section to a Block outside of the Section. Entry 
Points are set up using Paths of Blocks in the Section--Paths that represent connections 
to Blocks not contained in the Section. Entry Points are classified in one of two ways:
<ol><li>Whether entering the Section at that Entry Point will result in a train traveling in the "forward" 
direction<li>
<li>whether entering at that Entry Point will result in a train 
traveling in the "reverse" direction.</li></ol></P>
<p> Sections are designed to be allocated to one train at a time. If a portion of 
connected track is long enough to support multiple trains simultaneously traveling in 
the same direction, one following the other, that connected track should be divided into 
two or more Sections, if the user wants to run following trains in that area.</p>
<H2> Requirements for using Sections
</H2>
<P>Sections may be used with a Panel Editor panel, with a Layout Editor panel, with 
a CTC machine, or directly without any panel provided. Sections build on JMRI's 
Blocks and Paths structure. So before attempting to create any Sections, you should 
have Blocks and Paths fully initialized for your layout. (An easy way to 
automatically initialize your Blocks and Paths is to sketch out a Layout Editor panel 
of your layout, with blocks assigned. By assigning blocks to all track segments, turnouts, etc., 
the paths will be created automatically for you by the software.)</p>
<p>Layout blocking should be carefully planned, to provide "<i>reasonable</i>" 
Sections--Sections that make sense for a dispatcher to allocate to a train. For 
right-handed or left-handed turnouts switching mainline track, for 
example, this usually means including the turnout in the same block as the track 
entering at the turnout throat, and providing separate blocks for continuing 
and diverging tracks. Some prefer to have a turnout in a separate block, and that 
works fine also. From a dispatching perspective, tracks of mainline turnouts that 
branch to industries do not need to be separately blocked, but blocking here is 
acceptable. A layout blocking scheme that works well for signals, should work fine 
for Sections also.</p>
<p>Signals are not required for using Sections, but Sections will work fine with 
signals installed. If signals are installed, the direction sensors included in 
Sections provide an easy way to set up simple APB signaling (see below).</p>  
<H2> Support for Optional Direction and Stopping Sensors
</H2>
<P>Optionally each Section may have two <i>direction sensors</i>, one for the forward 
direction and one for the reverse direction. These are normally internal Sensors, 
bearing system names that begin with IS. They automatically follow the state of their 
Section. A Section has three states, <b>FREE</b> (not allocated to a train), <b>FORWARD</b> 
(allocated for travel in the forward direction), and <b>REVERSE</b> (allocated for travel in 
the reverse direction. When the state of the Section is <b>FREE</b> both direction 
sensors are set <b>ACTIVE</b>. When the state of the Section is <b>FORWARD</b>, the 
forward direction sensor is <b>INACTIVE</b> and the reverse direction sensor is 
<b>ACTIVE</b>. Similarly, when the state of the Section is <b>REVERSE</b>, the forward 
direction sensor is <b>ACTIVE</b> and the reverse direction sensor is <b>INACTIVE</b>. 
These sensors may be used in signal logic to force signals for travel in the direction 
opposite to the allocated direction to <b>RED</b>. Tools are provided here in the 
Section Table to automatically add add direction sensors to signal logic or to 
automatically remove all direction sensors from signal logic, (<a href="#tools">
see below</a>). Alternatively, if <A HREF="../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"><b>Dispatcher</b></a>
is being used, it can add direction sensors to signal logic as needed.</P>
<P>Also optionally each Section may have two <i>stopping sensors</i> that indicate
when a train in the Section has reached the end of the Section by traveling in 
the forward direction or in the reverse direction. Stopping sensors should be physical 
sensors on the layout, for example infrared point detectors. For manual dispatching, 
these sensors may be displayed on a panel to indicate to the dispatcher when a train 
has reached the end of its allocation. For automatic running, these sensors may 
be used to stop a train before it reaches the end of its allocated Section, and 
before it overruns a red signal, if signals are present.</>
<H2> Using the Section Table to Display and Create Sections
</H2>
<P>All the Sections that JMRI knows about can be viewed using the <b>Section 
Table</b>.   Sections can either be created manually within the Section Table window, 
or they can be created automatically if you also plan to use SignalMast Logic  <A HREF="#SignalMast">(see below).</a>
Select <b>Sections</b> in the <b>Tables</b> submenu of the <b>Tools</b> menu 
of the main JMRI program window. There are eight columns in the Section Table:</P>
<UL>
<LI><b>System Name</b> - The system name is assigned to the Section when it's created, 
and can't be changed.</LI>
<LI><b>User Name</b> - If you're interested in having your Sections carry "human readable"
names, you can click in the "User Name" column and change that information
to whatever you want.</LI>
<LI><b>State</b> - The state of a Section tells whether a section is "allocated" 
or "in use" by one or more trains.  The state of a newly added section is always
<b>FREE</b>. When a Section is allocated for travel in the direction from the 
"First Block" toward the "Last Block", the state is <b>FORWARD</b>.  When allocated 
for travel in the opposite direction, the state is <b>REVERSE</b>.</LI>
<LI><b>Comment</b> - This column is for your use to record any comment you may want
to use to keep track of your Sections. It is for information only.</LI>
<LI>Click the <b>Delete</b> button in a specific row to delete the Section in that row. 
Remember to remove any Transits using this Section. Any Transit that 
uses a deleted Section will be broken! Use this button with caution!</LI>
<LI><b>First Block</b> - This column displays the first block in the Section. 
Since a section is a group of one or more connected blocks, there is always an
entry.</LI> 
<LI><b>Last Block</b> - This column shows the final block in the Section. 
Since a section may contain only one block, the Last Block may be the same as the First 
Block.</LI>
<LI>Click the <b>Edit</b> button in a row to view or change entered information
for a Section. System name cannot be changed. User name may be changed, 
blocks may be redefined, entry points may be reconfigured, etc. Only one Section 
may be edited at a time. A Section may not be edited if another is being created. 
</LI>
</UL>
<P>To Create a new Section, click the 
"<A HREF="SectionAddEdit.shtml">Add.." button</a>. A window will be brought up 
that will allow you to define the blocks included in the new Section, and if 
necessary, designate which entry points to the section result in travel in the 
FORWARD and REVERSE directions.</p>
<p>Currently the user must manually select <b>FORWARD</b> or <b>REVERSE</b> for each 
Entry Point after all Blocks are added to a Section. The program will set some directions
automatically, but others are left as <b>UNKNOWN</b>. An Entry Point should be set 
to FORWARD if a train entering the Section at that Entry Point would be traveling 
in the FORWARD direction. Otherwise it should be set to REVERSE. A possible future 
addition is to set directions of Entry Points automatically from the connectivity 
found in a Layout Editor panel.</p>
<p>For Sections with more than one Block, travel from a lower-numbered block to 
a higher-numbered block is FORWARD travel. Stated a different way, moving from a 
block higher in the block list to a block lower in the list is FORWARD travel. 
Similarly moving from a higher-numbered block to a lower-numbered block is REVERSE 
travel. For Sections with only one block, it doesn't make any difference which 
direction through the Section is designated FORWARD, as long as Entry Point travel
directions are consistent. That is: 
<UL>
<LI>REVERSE and FORWARD directions of travel must be opposite.</li> 
<LI>Entering at any FORWARD Entry Point must result in travel in the same 
direction as entering at all other FORWARD Entry Points.</li>
<li>Entering at any REVERSE Entry Point must result in travel 
in the same direction as entering at all other REVERSE Entry Points.</li>
</UL>
<p><b>WARNING: If Entry Points are not consistent strange behavior may result 
when using the Section.</b></p>
<H2><a name='SignalMast'>Using SignalMast Logic With Sections</a></H2>
<p>If the signalling is based using Signal Masts, with the associated logic that has been generated 
using the layout editor, then it is possible to also have sections automatically generated based 
upon the logic.
<p>The tool can be found in the <b>SignalMast Logic Table</b>|<b>Tools</b> | <b>Generate Sections</b>
 Running this will immediately create Sections that each contain all of the Blocks between any already-defined Signal Mast Pairs.
 It will also setup each "Automatically Generated" Section so that they  include those Blocks in  the correct order, 
 with the direction being set as FORWARD travel, going from the source to destination SignalMast. 
 Please note that the block details are not saved when the panel is stored, but are re-created when the file is loaded. 
<p>The tool will also automatically create forward and reverse direction sensors and places them in the sectionSection, however 
currently the Signal Mast Logic does not use these and their creation is only there to allow validation of the section 
(or use by the user in unrelated Logix if desired).
<p>Sections generated with the tool will only have a pair of Entry Points and simply follows the path between the two signals.
<p>Direction Sensors (Forward and Reverse) are created by the Generate Sections tool, but Stopping Sensors (Forward and Reverse) 
need to be added manually by the user via the Edit Sections window for each section if desired.
<p>The details of the Optional Direction and Stopping Sensors are saved when the panel file is stored.
<p>To use the Sections that have been built this way you will next need to setup <a href="TransitTable.shtml">Transits</a>, Following that, 
you will also need to set the <A HREF="../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml"><b>Dispatcher</b></a> 
to use SignalMast Logic via the Dispatcher's <A HREF="../dispatcher/Options.shtml"><b>Options</b></a> menu.
<a name="tools"><H2> Section Table Tools
</H2>
<P> The Section Table has a <b>Tools</b> menu to facilitate use of Sections. 
Normally these tools would be used after all Sections are defined. 
The menu items and their use are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Validate All Sections...</b> - When this item is selected, each Section 
is tested for self consistency.  Current tests include checking the connectivity 
between multiple blocks, checking that there are no missing Entry Points or 
extra Entry Points, and, if a Layout Editor panel is available, checking that 
Paths are correctly set up for the Blocks in the Sections.  <b>This tool does 
not check if the FORWARD and REVERSE directions are correctly set for each 
Entry Point</b>, but that feature is a planned future addition.  After testing is 
complete, a message is displayed giving the results of the testing. Detailed error 
messages, if any, are placed in the JMRI error log.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Set Direction Sensors in Logic...</b> (Not required when using SignalMast Logic)
 - When this item is selected, 
direction sensors defined for each Section are placed in the signal logic 
of appropriate signal heads--those signal heads internal to the Section or 
protecting entry to the Section. Direction sensors follow the allocation 
status of their Sections. When a Section is FREE (not allocated), both of its 
direction sensors are set ACTIVE. By placing these sensors in appropriate 
signal head logic, all signals internal to or protecting entry points to the 
Section are forced RED when the Section is FREE. When a Section is allocated 
for travel in the FORWARD direction, its forward direction sensor is set 
INACTIVE, allowing signal head logic to function normally for travel through 
the Section in the FORWARD direction, but keeping signals governing travel in 
the REVERSE direction set RED. Similarly, when the Section is allocated for travel 
in the REVERSE direction, the reverse direction sensor is set INACTIVE, and the 
forward direction sensor is set ACTIVE, allowing signals to clear travel in the 
REVERSE direction, but to block travel in the FORWARD direction. Setting the state of
direction sensors is done automatically by software in 
<A HREF="../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a> that allocates 
Sections.</p>
<p>Note: Dispatcher can place direction sensors in SSL signal logic automatically 
when a train is activated. Dispatcher will place direction sensors if it is provided 
with a Layout Editor panel and allowed to use its connectivity (required for automatic 
running). This allows using direction-based signaling even if the panel is stored 
with these sensors removed from signal logic.</p>
<p> This tool should only be used after all Sections have been defined and all 
signal head logic has been set up. A Layout Editor panel is required, because 
the software needs the panel's connectivity to figure out which signal 
heads need which direction sensor.  If a direction sensor is already in the 
Simple Signal Logic (SSL) for a signal head, it is not duplicated.  However, if 
an incorrect direction sensor is present in the SSL, it is not removed. (Use the tool 
described below to remove direction sensors.) After placing direction sensors is 
complete a message is displayed giving results. Detailed 
error messages, if any, are placed in the JMRI error log. When an error occurs, 
the most common reasons are 1) missing information (signal heads missing or 
signal logic not set up) or 2) errors in setting up Section Entry Point 
directions.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Remove Direction Sensors from Logic...</b> (Not required when using SignalMast Logic) 
- This tool assembles a list 
of all direction sensors defined in Sections currently in the Section Table, then 
removes all sensors that are contained in this list from the Simple Signal Logic 
(SSL) of all signal heads. This tool cancels the effect of the <b>Set Direction 
Sensors in Logic...</b> tool, removes any direction sensors that may have been placed 
by <A HREF="../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a>, and in addition removes 
any defined direction sensors 
that might be in an incorrect SSL. If errors were noted while setting direction 
sensors using the above tool, then corrected, running this tool before attempting 
to set direction sensors again is sometimes useful.</li>
<p>A Layout Editor panel is required to run this tool. After removal of direction 
sensors from signal logic is complete a message is displayed giving the results 
of running the tool. Detailed error messages, if any, are placed in the JMRI 
error log.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<H2> Saving Sections to Disk
</H2>
<P> Use the <b>Store</b> item in the <b>File</b> menu of the Section Table (or 
the <b>Store Panels...</b> item in the <b>Panels</b> menu of the main JMRI 
window) to save Section information to disk. This information (and any modified 
signal logic information) is saved with the configuration and panels in an XML 
file, along with control panel setup and similar stuff. To store your panels in 
the same file (recommended), select <b>File>Store>Store Configuration and Panels To 
File...</b> or select <b>Panels>Store Panels...</b> in the main JMRI window.
