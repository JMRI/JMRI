<H1>The Section Table
</H1>
<H2> What is a Section?
</H2>
<P>A <b>Section</b> is a group of one or more connected <b>Blocks</b> that may be 
allocated to one or more trains traveling in a given direction. A Block may be 
in multiple Sections. All Blocks contained in a given Section must be unique. 
Blocks are kept in order--the first block is connected to the second, the second 
is connected to the third, etc. That means a Block in a Section must be connected 
to the Block before it (if there is one) and to the Block after it (if there is 
one), but may not be connected to any other Block in the Section. A Section may 
not contain any reverse loops.</P>
<p>Sections and their associated <b>Transits</b> are designed to be used for 
dispatching, either manually by a dispatcher sitting at a panel, or automatically 
when running trains automatically.</>
<P>A Section has a <b>direction</b> defined by the sequence in which Blocks are 
added to the Section. A train may run through a Section in either the <b>forward</b> 
direction (from first block to last block) or <b>reverse</b> direction (from last 
block to first block). A Section of sufficient length may be allocated to more 
than one train provided the trains are traveling in the same direction. There 
must be at least one block between trains traveling in the same direction in a 
Section.</p>
<P>A Section has two or more <b>Entry Points</b>. An Entry Point defines a 
connection to a Block outside of the Section. Entry Points are derived from Paths of 
Blocks in the Section--Paths that represent connections to Blocks not contained in 
the Section. Entry Points are grouped according to whether entering 
the Section at that Entry Point will result in a train traveling in the "forward" 
direction, or whether entering at that Entry Point will result in a train 
traveling in the "reverse" direction.</P>
<H2> Requirements for using Sections
</H2>
<P>Sections may be used with a Panel Editor panel, with a Layout Editor panel, with 
a CTC machine, or directly without any panel provided. Sections build on JMRI's 
Blocks and Paths structure. So Before attempting to create any Sections, you should 
have Blocks and Paths fully initialized for your layout. (An easy way to 
automatically initialize your Blocks and Paths is to sketch out a Layout Editor panel 
of your layout, with blocks assigned.)</p>
<p>Layout blocking should be carefully planned, to provide "<i>reasonable</i>" 
Sections--Sections that make sense for a dispatcher to allocate to a train. For 
right-handed or left-handed turnouts switching mainline track, for 
example, this usually means including the turnout in the same block as the track 
entering at the turnout throat, and providing separate blocks for continuing 
and diverging tracks. Some prefer to have a turnout in a separate block, and that 
works fine also. From a dispatching perspective, tracks of mainline turnouts that 
branch to industries do not need to be separately blocked, but blocking here is 
acceptable. A layout blocking scheme that works well for signals, should work fine 
for Sections also.</p>
<p>Signals are not required for using Sections, but Sections will work fine with 
signals installed. If signals are installed, Sections provide an easy way to set 
up simple APB signaling (see below).</p>  
<H2> Support for Optional Sensors
</H2>
<P>Optionally each Section may have two <i>direction sensors</i>, one for the forward 
direction and one for the reverse direction. These are normally internal Sensors, 
bearing system names that begin with IS. They automatically follow the state of their 
Section, i.e. when the state of the Section is FORWARD, the Forward Sensor is 
<b>INACTIVE</b> and the Reverse Sensor is <b>ACTIVE</b>. These sensors may be used 
to force signals for travel in their respective directions to <b>RED</b> when they 
are ACTIVE. When a Section is FREE, both of its direction Sensors are ACTIVE.</P>
<P>Also optionally each Section may have two <i>stopping sensors</i> that indicate
when a train in the Section has reached the end of the Section by traveling in 
the forward direction or in the reverse direction. For manual dispatching, these 
sensors may be displayed on a panel to indicate to the dispatcher when a train 
has reached the end of its allocation. For automatic running, these sensors may 
be used to stop a train before it reaches the end of its allocated Section, and 
before it overruns a red signal, if signals are present.</>
<H2> Using the Sensor Table to Display and Create Sensors
</H2>
<P>All the Sections that JMRI knows about can be referenced
using the <b>Section Table</b> tool under <b>Tables</b> in the Tools menu of most 
JMRI programs. There are eight columns in the table:</P>
<UL>
<LI><b>System Name</b> - The system name is assigned to the Section when it's created, 
and can't be changed.</LI>
<LI><b>User Name</b> - If you're interested in having your Sections carry "human readable"
names, you can click in the "User Name" column and change that information
to whatever you want.</LI>
<LI><b>State</b> - The state of a Section tells whether a section is "allocated" 
or "in use" by one or more trains.  The state of a newly added section is always
<b>FREE</b>. When a Section is allocated for travel in the direction from the 
"Begin Block" toward the "End Block", the state is <b>FORWARD</b>.  When allocated 
for travel in the opposite direction, the state is <b>REVERSE</b>.</LI>
<LI><b>Comment</b> - This column is for your use to record any comment you may want
to use to keep track of your Sections. It is for information only.</LI>
<LI>Click the <b>Delete</b> button in a specific row to delete the Section in that row. 
Remember to remove any Transits associated using this Section. Any Transit that 
uses a deleted Section will be broken! Use this button with caution!</LI>
<LI><b>Begin Block</b> - This column displays the first block in the Section. 
Since a section is a group of one or more connected blocks, there is always an
entry.</LI> 
<LI><b>End Block</b> - This column shows the final block in the Section. 
Since a section may contain only one block, this entry may be the same as the Begin
Block entry.</LI>
<LI>Click the <b>Edit</b> button in a row to view or change entered information
for a Section. System name cannot be changed. User name may be changed, 
blocks may be redefined, entry points may be reconfigured, etc. Only one Section 
may be edited at a time. A Section may not be edited if another is being created. 
</LI>
</UL>
<P>To Create a new Section, click the 
"<A HREF="SectionAddEdit.shtml">Add.." button</a>. A window will be brought up 
that will allow you to define the blocks included in the new Section, and if 
necessary, designate which entry points to the section result in travel in the 
forward and reverse directions.</p>
<p>Currently the user must manually select <b>FORWARD</b> or <b>REVERSE</b> for each 
Entry Point after all Blocks are added to a Section. The program will set some directions
automatically, but others are left as <b>UNKNOWN</b>. An Entry Point should be set 
to FORWARD if a train entering the Section at that Entry Point would be traveling 
in the FORWARD direction. Otherwise it should be set to REVERSE. It doesn't make any 
difference which direction through a Section is designated FORWARD, as long as all 
Entry Points are consistent. A possible future addition is to set directions of 
Entry Points automatically from the connectivity found in a Layout Editor panel, if 
one is available.</p>
<H2> Saving Sections to Disk
</H2>
<P> Use the Store item in the File menu to save Section information to disk. This 
information is saved with the configuration in an XML file, along
with control panel setup and similar stuff.  To store your panels in the same 
file (recommended), select <b>File>Store>Store Configuration and Panels To 
File...</b> or select <b>Panels>Store panels...</b> in the main JMRI window.
