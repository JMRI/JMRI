      <h1>Section Table Help</h1>
      <h2>Using the Section Table</h2>

      <p>All the Sections that JMRI knows about can be viewed using
      the <strong>Section Table</strong>.</p>

      <p>To open this tool, select <strong>Sections</strong> in the
      <strong>Tables</strong> submenu of the <strong>Tools</strong> menu of the main
      JMRI program window.</p>

      <h3>Section Table Columns</h3>
      You may change the order of the columns by dragging their titles,
      and sort the rows by clicking one of the sort triangles next to
      a column title. There are eight columns in the Section Table:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>System Name</strong> - The system name is assigned to the
        Section when it's created, and can't be changed.</li>

        <li><strong>User Name</strong> - If you're interested in having your
        Sections carry "human readable" names, you can click in the
        "User Name" column and change that information to whatever
        you want.</li>

        <li><strong>State</strong> - The state of a Section tells whether a
        section is "allocated" or "in use" by a train.
        The state of a newly added section is always <strong>FREE</strong>.
        When a Section is allocated for travel in the direction
        from the "First Block" toward the "Last Block", the state
        is <strong>FORWARD</strong>. When allocated for travel in the
        opposite direction, the state is <strong>REVERSE</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>Comment</strong> - This column is for your use to record
        any comment you may want to use to keep track of your
        Sections. It is for information only.</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button in a specific row to
        delete the Section in that row. Remember to remove any
        Transits that are using this Section. Any Transit that uses a
        deleted Section will be broken! Review the warning dialog
        and use this button with caution!
        <span style="float: right;">
            <img src="images/SectionDeleteWarning.png" height="79" width="216" alt="Delete warning">
        </span>
        </li>

        <li><strong>First Block</strong> - This column displays the first
        block in the Section. Since a section is a group of one or
        more connected blocks, there is always an entry.</li>

        <li><strong>Last Block</strong> - This column shows the final block
        in the Section. Since a section may contain only one block,
        the Last Block may be the same as the First Block.</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button in a row to view or change
        entered information for a Section. System name cannot be
        changed. User name may be changed, blocks may be redefined,
        entry points may be reconfigured, etc. Only one Section may
        be edited at a time. A Section may not be edited while another one
        is being created.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Creating a new Section</h3>

      <p>To Create a new Section, click the
      "<a href="SectionAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a>" button at the bottom of the
      Section Table pane. A window will be brought up that will
      allow you to define the blocks included in the new Section,
      and if necessary, designate which entry points to the section
      result in travel in the FORWARD and REVERSE directions.</p>

      <h3>Section Table Tools</h3>

      <p>The Section Table has a <strong>Tools</strong> menu to facilitate
      use of Sections. Normally these tools would be used after all
      Sections are defined. The menu items and their use are
      described below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Validate All Sections...</strong> - When this item is
          selected, each Section is tested for self consistency.
          Current tests include checking the connectivity between
          multiple blocks, checking that there are no missing Entry
          Points or extra Entry Points, and, if a Layout Editor
          panel is available, checking that Paths are correctly set
          up for the Blocks in the Sections. <strong>This tool does not
          check if the FORWARD and REVERSE directions are correctly
          set for each Entry Point</strong>, but that feature is a
          planned future addition. After testing is complete, a
          message is displayed giving the results of the testing.
          Detailed error messages, if any, are placed in the JMRI
          error log.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Set Direction Sensors in Logic...</strong> (Not applicable
          when using Signal Mast Logic) - When this item is
          selected, direction sensors defined for each Section are
          placed in the signal logic of appropriate signal
          heads--those signal heads internal to the Section or
          protecting entry to the Section. Direction sensors follow
          the allocation status of their Sections. When a Section
          is FREE (not allocated), both of its direction sensors
          are set ACTIVE. By placing these sensors in appropriate
          signal head logic, all signals internal to or protecting
          entry points to the Section are forced RED when the
          Section is FREE. When a Section is allocated for travel
          in the FORWARD direction, its forward direction sensor is
          set INACTIVE, allowing signal head logic to function
          normally for travel through the Section in the FORWARD
          direction, but keeping signals governing travel in the
          REVERSE direction set RED. Similarly, when the Section is
          allocated for travel in the REVERSE direction, the
          reverse direction sensor is set INACTIVE, and the forward
          direction sensor is set ACTIVE, allowing signals to clear
          travel in the REVERSE direction, but to block travel in
          the FORWARD direction. Setting the state of direction
          sensors is done automatically by software in <a href=
          "../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a> that
          allocates Sections.

          <p>Note: Dispatcher can place direction sensors in SSL
          signal logic automatically when a train is activated.
          Dispatcher will place direction sensors if it is provided
          with a Layout Editor panel and allowed to use its
          connectivity (required for automatic running). This
          allows using direction-based signaling even if the panel
          is stored with these sensors removed from signal
          logic.</p>

          <p>This tool should only be used after all Sections have
          been defined and all signal head logic has been set up. A
          Layout Editor panel is required, because the software
          needs the panel's connectivity to figure out which signal
          heads need which direction sensor. If a direction sensor
          is already in the Simple Signal Logic (SSL) for a signal
          head, it is not duplicated. However, if an incorrect
          direction sensor is present in the SSL, it is not
          removed. (Use the tool described below to remove
          direction sensors.) After placing direction sensors is
          complete a message is displayed giving results. Detailed
          error messages, if any, are placed in the JMRI error log.
          When an error occurs, the most common reasons are 1)
          missing information (signal heads missing or signal logic
          not set up) or 2) errors in setting up Section Entry
          Point directions.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Remove Direction Sensors from Logic...</strong> (Not
        applicable when using Signal Mast Logic) - This tool assembles
        a list of all direction Sensors defined in Sections
        currently in the Section Table, then removes all Sensors
        that are contained in this list from the Simple Signal
        Logic (SSL) of all Signal Heads. This tool cancels the
        effect of the <strong>Set Direction Sensors in Logic...</strong>
        tool, removes any direction Sensors that may have been
        placed by <a href=
        "../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a>, and in
        addition removes any defined direction Sensors that might
        be in an incorrect SSL. If errors were noted while setting
        direction sensors using the above tool, then corrected,
        running this tool before attempting to set direction
        sensors again is sometimes useful.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">
          A Layout Editor Panel is required to run this tool.
          After removal of direction Sensors from Signal Logic is
          completed a message is displayed giving the results of
          running the tool. Detailed error messages, if any, are
          placed in the JMRI error log.
        </li>
      </ul>
