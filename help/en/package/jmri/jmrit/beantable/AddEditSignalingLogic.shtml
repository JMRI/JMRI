      <h1><a name="Adding/Editing Routes"></a>Adding/Editing Signal
      Mast Logic</h1>

      <p>After clicking on the "Add..." button below the <a href=
      "../beantable/SignalMastLogicTable.shtml">Signal Mast Logic
      Table</a>, the following pane appears:</p>
      <a href=
      "../beantable/images/SignalMastLogicAdd.png"><img src=
      "../beantable/images/SignalMastLogicAdd.png" align="right"
      width="340" height="300" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt=
      "Signal Head Logic Add pane"></a>

      <p>Start creating a Signal Mast Logic by selecting a
      <b>Source Signal Mast</b> followed by a <b>Destination
      Signal Mast</b> from the pop-ups.<br>
      The Source (Signal) Mast is the one which you wish
      to control in this Pair and set the Appearances on.<br>
      The Destination (Signal) Mast is the next signal mast down
      the line. The Appearance of the Destination Mast along
      with the state of the Turnouts and Blocks that you select
      on this pane will have a direct effect on the Appearance of
      the Source Mast.<br>
      If you are not using the Layout Editor, then <em>no</em>
      validation is performed of the Source and Destination Signal
      Masts. If the Layout Editor is being used, then the system
      will try and determine if the Destination Mast is reachable
      from the Source Mast and warn you when a connection is not
      found</p>

      <p>The check box "Use Layout Editor Paths" allows you to get
      JMRI to automatically generate the required Blocks, Turnouts
      and Signal Masts, along with their states, that are located
      between the source and destination Signal Masts.<br>
      Upon selecting "Use Layout Editor Paths", two further check
      boxes will appear: "Use Turnout Details From Layout Editor"
      and "Use Block Details From Layout Editor". Selecting either
      of these will determine what information from the Layout
      Editor is used when the system automatically generates the
      route.<br>
      The automatically generated information is not saved with the
      panel file, but it is generated each time the layout panel is
      opened.<br>
      If the information on the <a href=
      "../display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor</a> panel
      is edited, changes are not immediately reflected in the
      Signal Mast Logic; you will need to store the panel, close
      JMRI and re-open the panel for the Signal Mast Logic to be
      updated.</p>

      <p>The "Allow The Logic to Automatically Determine
      Conflicting SignalMasts" option tries to determine which
      Signal Masts could possibly cause a conflicting route if they
      were not set to danger.</p>

      <p>The "Lock Turnouts when Signal Mast Logic is active"
      feature allows you to selectively disable accessory (Turnout)
      commands from cabs and/or locally-wired pushbuttons. When
      selected, JMRI disables pushbuttons by sending pushbutton
      disable commands to the Turnout decoders when the route is
      locked, and enables the pushbuttons when the route is
      unlocked. When locking a Turnout from cab commands, the JMRI
      program will monitor the Turnout's accessory address and if
      it detects a change command from a cab, will cancel the
      command immediately by sending out the opposite command to
      the Turnout. All Turnouts that are being monitored by the
      JMRI program and are included in the route will be
      locked.</p>

      <a href=
      "../beantable/images/SignalPairsEdit.png"><img src=
      "../beantable/images/SignalPairsEdit.png" align="right"
      width="341" height="274" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt=
      "Signal Head Logic Add pane Sensor tab"></a>

      <p>The "Show" radio buttons allow you to show <b>All</b>
      or only the <b>Included</b> Turnouts, Sensors, Blocks and
      Signal Masts that are selected as part of this Signal
      Mast Logic.</p>

      <p>There are four tabs below the "Show" buttons, each
      containing the details of Blocks, Turnouts, Sensors and
      Signal Masts that make up the Signal Mast Logic for this
      Source Mast. In each of these tabs, there is an editable
      table that allows you to manually select which item(s) should
      be included in the Signal Mast Logic and the State which each
      of those items should be in.<br>
      Below that is a second table that shows the automatically
      generated items (except under the Sensors tab). Manually
      entered items over-ride the automatically generated items,
      therefore if you wish to over-ride any item in this
      automatically generated list then select the corresponding
      item and set the state in the upper table. Click the
      "Include" box in any of the tables to add the desired item to
      your Signal Mast Logic. Next to the "Include" box is the
      State option which that item must be in for the Source Signal
      Mast to come active.<br>
      For example, if you wish a Turnout to be
      in a Thrown state to trigger the Signal Mast Logic, then
      select "Thrown" in the drop down box. If you wish to
      over-ride a Turnout that was automatically included, and you
      don't care what state it is set to, check "Include" in the
      upper table and select "Any State" from the drop down
      box.</p>

      <p>Clicking on the "Update Signal (Mast) Logic" button will
      add or update this Signal Mast Logic to the system. Once
      added, the tables holding the automatically generated data
      will be re-populated.<br>
      Tip: To update/fill the State column under the Signal Masts
      tab, update &amp; reopen the Signal Mast Logic item.</p>
