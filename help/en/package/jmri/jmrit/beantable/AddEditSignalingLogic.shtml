		<p>After clicking on the "Add..." button below the <a href="../beantable/SignalMastLogicTable.shtml">Signal Mast Logic Table</a>, the following window appears:</p>

</a>

<p>Start creating a Signal Mast Logic by selecting a
Source Signal Mast followed by a Destination Signal Mast from the pop-ups. The Source (Signal) Mast is the one 
which you wish to control and set the Appearances on.  The Destination (Signal) Mast 
is the next signal mast down the line. The Appearance of the Destination Mast 
along with the state of the Turnouts and Blocks that you check on this screen will have a direct effect on the 
Appearance of the Source Mast.<br>
	If you are not using the Layout Editor, then <em>no</em> validation is performed of the 
source and destination Signal Masts.  If the Layout Editor is being used, 
then the system will try and determine if the Destination Mast is reachable from 
the Source Mast.
</p>
<p>The check box "Use Layout Editor Paths" allows 
you to get JMRI to automatically generate the required Blocks, Turnouts and 
Signal Masts, along with their states, that are located between the source and 
destination Signal Masts.<br>
	Upon selecting "Use Layout Editor Paths", two further check boxes will appear:
"Use Turnout Details From Layout Editor" and "Use Block Details From Layout Editor". 
Selecting either of these will determine what information from the Layout Editor 
is used when the system automatically generates the route.<br>
The automatically generated information is not saved with the panel file, but it is generated each time the layout panel is opened.<br>
If the information on the Layout Editor panel is edited, changes are not 
immediately reflected in the Signal Mast Logic; you will need to store the panel, close JMRI 
and re-open the panel for the Signal Mast Logic to be updated.</p>
<p>
The "Allow The Logic to Automatically Determine Conflicting SignalMasts" option 
tries to determine which Signal Masts could possibly cause a conflicting route 
if they were not set to danger.</p>
<p>
The "Lock Turnouts when Signal Mast Logic is active" feature allows you to 
selectively disable accessory (Turnout) commands from cabs and/or locally-wired pushbuttons. 
When selected, JMRI disables pushbuttons by sending pushbutton disable commands to the
Turnout decoders when the route is locked, and enables the pushbuttons
when the route is unlocked. When locking a Turnout from cab commands,
the JMRI program will monitor the Turnout's accessory address and if it
detects a change command from a cab, will cancel the command immediately
by sending out the opposite command to the Turnout. All Turnouts that
are being monitored by the JMRI program and are included in the route
will be locked.</p>

<p>The "Show" radio buttons allow you to show all or only the selected Turnouts, Sensors, Blocks or Signal Masts 
that are part of this Signal Mast Logic.</p>
<p>
There are four tabs below the "Show" buttons, each containing the details of Blocks, 
Turnouts, Sensors and Signal Masts that make up the Signal Mast Logic for this Source Mast.
In each of these tabs, there is an editable table that allows you to manually 
select which item(s) should be included in the Signal Mast Logic and the state 
which each item should be in.<br>
Below that is a second table that shows the automatically generated items 
(except under the Sensors tab).  Manually entered items over-ride the automatically
generated items, therefore if you wish to over-ride any item in this automatically
generated list then select the corresponding item and 
set the state in the upper table.

Click the "Include" box in any of the tables to add the desired item to your 
Signal Mast Logic. Next to the "Include" box
is the State option which that item must be in for the Source Signal Mast to come active. 
For example, if you wish a Turnout to be in a Thrown state to trigger the 
Signal Mast Logic, then select "Thrown" in the drop down box.  If you wish to over-ride a 
Turnout that was automatically included, and you don't care what state it is 
set to, check "Include" in the upper table and select "Any State" from the drop down box.</p>

<p>Clicking on the "Update Signal (Mast) Logic" button will add or update this Signal Mast Logic to the system. Once added, the 
tables holding the automatically generated data will be re-populated.<br>
	Tip: To update/fill the State column under the Signal Masts tab, update &amp; reopen the Signal Mast Logic item.
