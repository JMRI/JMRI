      <h1>The Light Table</h1>

      <p>Lights are digital output bits that function as on/off
      switches. Lights were created to provide easy control for
      fascia panel lights and scenery lighting. Lights can also be
      used for any purpose that requires an on/off switch. A Light
      can be used, for example, to activate an electromagnetic
      decoupler for a pre-determined time in response to a fascia
      panel button, or play a layout sound via a stationary
      decoder.</p>

      <p>Lights share available digital output bits with Turnouts.
      Either a Light or a Turnout, but not both, can control a
      specific digital output bit. Since Lights lack the feedback
      structure of Turnouts, Lights should not be used to control
      track switches (turnouts) on the layout; only Turnouts should
      be used to control track switches. For historical reasons,
      Signal Head appearances are defined using Turnouts, even
      though they may actually be physical lights. So Turnouts
      should be used to reference the digital output bits used with
      JMRI Signal Heads. Lights should be used if you need a simple
      mechanism to control scenery lighting or panel lights, or for
      other on/off tasks where the control mechanisms of Lights fit
      the need.</p>

      <p>Optionally a Light may be controlled in five ways:
      <ul>
        <li>by a single Sensor</li>
        <li>by two Sensors</li>
        <li>by a Turnout</li>
        <li>by the JMRI Fast Clock</li>
        <li>or switched on for a specified time by a Sensor.</li>
      </ul>
      One or more of these controls may be specified when the
      Light is created, or when it is edited via the Light Table.</p>

      <p>When a Light is created, or when it is read from a
      configuration file, the Light is 'activated'; it is set up to
      monitor automatically any changes in state of its control
      Sensor(s), Turnout, or Fast Clock. When the controlling
      Sensor, Turnout, or Fast Clock changes in a user-specified
      way, the Light is switched on or off. Lights can also be
      controlled by <a href="LogixTable.shtml">Logix</a>, if more
      complicated control logic is needed.</p>

      <p>The Light Table contains an 'Enabled' column. For a Light
      to be triggered by its control Sensor, the Fast Clock, or its
      control Turnout, it must be "Enabled", that is, its check box
      in the 'Enabled' column must be checked. You can uncheck this
      box to temporarily disable a Light from being triggered, i.e.
      prevent it switching when its control mechanism fires.<br>
      You may change the order of the columns by dragging their titles,
      and sort the rows by clicking one of the sort triangles next to
      a column title.</p>

      <p>A Light may also be a variable light. This will depend on
      the interface and the hardware driving the physical
      light.</p>

      in the <a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Display">Display preferences</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Switching a Light On or Off</h2>

      <p>Lights may be turned on or off by clicking the button/icon in
      the State column of the Light Table. A Light may be set up to
      follow the state of a track switch (Turnout), On when the
      Turnout is Closed, and Off when it is Thrown, or vice versa.
      A Light may be set to follow the state of a block occupancy
      sensor, on when the sensor is active, and off when it is
      inactive, or vice versa. A Light may also be set by a fascia
      panel button if a Sensor for that button is defined as the
      control Sensor. A Light may be configured to follow the JMRI
      Fast Clock, On for a specified time period, then Off. A Light
      may be controlled by two Sensors, On when either of the two
      Sensors is Active (or Inactive). Two sensor control is useful
      in controlling layout sounds or crossing gates. A Light may
      also be controlled from a Logix, as the action of one of its
      conditionals. If you need more powerful logic to control your
      Light, consider using a <a href=
      "LogixTable.shtml">Logix</a>.</p>

      <p>Note that Enabled/Disabled applies only to a Light's
      automated control mechanism. A 'Disabled' state will not
      prevent a Light from being turned on or off using the button
      in the Light Table or from being controlled by a Logix.</p>

      <p>A variable Light may also be adjusted by entering a value
      of 0.00 to 1.00 in the <b>intensity column</b> for the Light.
      A Light that does not support variable intensities will
      consider any non zero value as meaning On. If a Light has
      transition effects enabled and configured, the Light will
      respond according to those options.</p>

      <p>The status button for a variable Light will also be a
      status indication of the variable Light. When it is not On or
      Off it will show if the last change was moving higher or
      lower. The intensity displayed will be the current intensity,
      not the target intensity, when transition effects are
      enabled.</p>

      <h2>Creating New Lights</h2>
      To define a new light, click the
      <a href="LightAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a> button the Light
      Table. This will take you to a <a href=
      "LightAddEdit.shtml">new pane</a> for adding or editing
      Lights.

      <h2>Saving Lights to Disk</h2>

      <p>Lights are saved in your layout configuration file, along
      with Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads, etc. To store this
      information on disk, use <b>Store &gt;</b> in the <b>File</b>
      menu at the top of the Lights Table (or other tables from the
      Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b> in the
      <b>Panel</b> menu. Note that the enabled/disabled state of
      each Light is not saved in the configuration file. When
      Lights are loaded from a configuration file, they are all
      enabled.</p>
