<H1>The Light Table</H1>
    
<p>Lights are digital output bits that function as on/off switches. Lights
were created to provide easy control for fascia panel lights and scenery
lighting. Lights can also be used for any purpose that requires an on/off
switch. A light can be used, for example, to activate an electromagnetic
decoupler for a pre-determined time in response to a fascia panel button,
or play a layout sound via a stationary decoder.</p>

<p>Lights share available digital output bits with Turnouts. Either a 
Light or a Turnout, but not both, can control a specific digital output bit.
Since Lights lack the feedback structure of Turnouts, Lights should not 
be used to control track switches (turnouts) on the layout; only Turnouts
should be used to control track switches. For historical reasons, Signal 
Head appearances are defined using Turnouts, even though they may actually
be physical lights. So Turnouts should be used to reference the digital 
output bits used with JMRI Signal Heads. Lights should be used if you need
a simple mechanism to control scenery lighting or panel lights, or for 
other on/off tasks where the control mechanisms of Lights fit the need.</p>

<p>Optionally a Light may be controlled in five ways: it may be 
controlled by a single sensor, by two sensors, by a turnout, by the JMRI 
fast clock, or switched on for a specified time by a sensor. One or more of 
these controls may be specified when the Light is created, or when it is 
edit via the Light Table.</p> 
<p>When a Light is created, or when it 
is read from a configuration file, the Light is 'activated'; it is set up
to monitor automatically any changes in state of its control sensor(s), 
turnout, or fast clock. When the controlling sensor, turnout, or fast clock
changes in a user-specified way, the Light is switched on or off. Lights 
can also be controlled by <a href="Logix.shtml">logixs</a>, if more 
complicated control logic is needed.</p>

<p>The Light Table contains an 'Enabled' column. For a Light to be 
triggered by its control sensor, the fast clock, or its control turnout,
it must be "enabled", that is, its check box in the 'Enabled' column
must be checked.  You can uncheck this box to temporarily disable a 
Light from being triggered, i.e. prevent it switching when its control
mechanism fires.</p>

<p>
	A light may also be a variable light.
    This will depend on the interface and the hardware driving the light.
</p>

<h2>Switching a Light On or Off</h2>

<p>Lights may be turned on or off by clicking the button in the State
column of the Light Table. A Light may be set up to follow the state of 
a track switch (turnout), on when the turnout is closed, and off when it is
thrown, or vice versa. A light may be set to follow the state of a block 
occupancy sensor, on when the sensor is active, and off when it is inactive, or
vice versa. A Light may also be set by a fascia panel button if a sensor for 
that button is defined as the control sensor. A light may be configured to 
follow the JMRI fast clock, on for a specified time period, then off. A Light 
may be controlled by two sensors, on when either of the two sensors is 
active (or inactive). Two sensor control is useful in controlling layout sounds 
or crossing gates.  A Light may also be controlled from a logix, as the 
action of one of its conditionals.  If you need more powerful logic to 
control your Light, consider using a <a href="Logix.shtml">logix</a>.</p>

<p>Note that enabled/disabled applies only to a Light's automated
control mechanism.  A 'disabled' state will not prevent a Light
from being turned on or off using the button in the Light Table or from 
being controlled by a logix.</p>

<p>
	A variable light may also be adjusted by entering a value of 0.00 to 1.00
	in the <b>intensity column</b> for the light.
	A light that does not support variable intensities will consider any non
	zero value as meaning on.
	If a light has transition effects enabled and configured the light will respond
	according to those options.
</p>
<p>
	The status button for a variable light will also be a status indication of the variable light.
	When it is not on or off it will show if the last change was moving higher or lower.
	The intensity displayed will be the current intensity, not the target intensity, when
	transition effects are enabled.
</p>
   
<h2>Creating New Lights</h2>

To define a new light, click the
<a href="LightAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a> button the light table.
This will take you to a 
<a href="LightAddEdit.shtml">new window</a>
for adding or editing Lights.

<h2>Saving Lights to Disk</h2>

<p>Lights are saved in your layout configuration file, along with turnouts, 
sensors, signal heads, etc.  To store this information on disk, use <b>Store 
></b> in the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Light 
Table (or other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store Panel...</b>
in the <b>Panel</b> menu. Note that the enabled/disabled state of each Light
is not saved in the configuration file.  When Lights are loaded from a
configuration file, they are all enabled.
