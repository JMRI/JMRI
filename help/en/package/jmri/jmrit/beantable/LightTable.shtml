      <h1>The Light Table</h1>

      <p>Lights are digital output bits that function as on/off
      switches. Lights were created to provide easy control for
      fascia panel lights and scenery lighting. Lights can also be
      used for any purpose that requires an on/off switch. </p>
      
     <p>Lights may also be defined as variable intensity (not just on/off).
      This will depend on the interface and the hardware driving the physical
      light.</p>

      <p>The Light Table contains the following columns:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>System Name</li>
        <li>User Name (optional)</li>
        <li>State</li>
        <li>Comment (optional, double click to edit)</li>
        <li>Enabled (Automated Light Control excl. Logix)</li>
        <li>Intensity (availble in certain hardware only)</li>
      </ul>   

      <p>The Light Table contains an 'Enabled' column. For a Light
      to be triggered by its control Sensor, the Fast Clock, or its
      control Turnout, it must be "Enabled", that is, its check box
      in the 'Enabled' column must be checked. You can uncheck this
      box to temporarily disable a Light from being triggered, i.e.
      prevent it switching when its control mechanism fires.<br>
      You may change the order of the columns by dragging their titles,
      and sort the rows by clicking one of the sort triangles next to
      a column title.</p>
      
    <p>Note that enabled / disabled column only applies to a Light's
      automated Light Control mechanism.
      <br>A 'disabled' state will not
      prevent a Light from being turned On or Off using the button
      in the Light Table or from being controlled by a Logix.</p>

      <h2>Creating New Lights</h2>
      To define a new light, click the <a href="LightAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a> button
      the Light Table. This will take you to a <a href= "LightAddEdit.shtml">new window</a>
      for adding or editing Lights.

      <h2>Turning Lights On/Off/Setting Intensity</h2>

      <p>Lights may be turned on or off by clicking the button/icon in the State column of the
      Light Table.</p>

      <p>A Light may be set up in the Light Table to be controlled by  the state of a track 
      switch (Turnout), a block occupancy sensor, or one or two sensors. For example, the sensor
      for a fascia panel button could be  specified as the control sensor for the light, turning
      it on or off. Two sensor control is useful in controlling layout sounds or crossing gates.</p>
      
      <p class="note">A Light ma also be controlled from a Logix, as the action of one of its
      conditionals. If you need more powerful logic to control your Light, consider using a <a href=
      "LogixTable.shtml">Logix</a>.</p>

      <p>Note that Enabled/Disabled applies only to a Light's
      automated control mechanism. A 'Disabled' state will not
      prevent a Light from being turned on or off using the button
      in the Light Table or from being controlled by a Logix.</p>

      <p>A variable Light may also be adjusted by entering a value
      of 0.00 to 1.00 in the <b>intensity column</b> for the Light.
      A Light that does not support variable intensities will
      consider any non zero value as meaning On. If a Light has
      transition effects enabled and configured, the Light will
      respond according to those options.</p>

      <p>The status button for a variable Light will also be a
      status indication of the variable Light. When it is not On or
      Off it will show if the last change was moving higher or
      lower. The intensity displayed will be the current intensity,
      not the target intensity, when transition effects are
      enabled.</p>

      <h2>Saving Lights to Disk</h2>

      <p>The Light Table is kept in your <i>layout configuration</i>, along
      with Turnouts, Sensors, Signal Heads, control panel setup etc. To store this
      information on disk, use <b>Store &gt;</b> in the <b>File</b> menu at the top
      of the Lights Table (or other tables from the Tools menu), or select <b>Store
      Panel...</b> in the <b>Panel</b> menu. Note that the enabled/disabled state of
      each Light is not saved in the configuration file. When Lights are loaded from
      a configuration file, they are all enabled.</p>
