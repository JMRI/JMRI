# Track Tiles Table

The Track Tiles Table displays a catalog of model railroad track components from various manufacturers. This is a read-only reference table showing available track pieces with their specifications.

## Table Columns

The table displays the following information for each track tile:

- **Vendor**: The manufacturer name (e.g., Märklin, Piko)
- **Family**: The track system family (e.g., C-Track, A-Track)  
- **Type**: The JMRI track type (straight, curved, turnout, crossing, end)
- **Part Code**: The manufacturer's catalog part number
- **Caption**: A localized description of the track piece

## Features

- **Sorting**: Click on any column header to sort the table by that column
- **Filtering**: Use the filter fields at the top to search for specific tiles
  - Filters can be combined (e.g., filter by vendor AND type)
  - Filters are case-insensitive and support partial matches
  - Regular expressions are supported for advanced filtering
- **Read-Only**: This is a reference catalog; values cannot be edited
- **Localization**: Captions are shown in your preferred language when available

## Track Tile Catalogs

Track tile catalogs are loaded from XML files in the `xml/tracktiles` directory. The catalog includes:

- Märklin C-Track (H0 scale)
- Piko A-Track (H0 scale)

Additional catalogs can be added by placing properly formatted XML files in the tracktiles directory.

## Using Track Tiles

This table serves as a reference when designing layouts in the Layout Editor. Use the part codes and specifications to:

- Verify availability of specific track pieces
- Plan track configurations
- Match physical track inventory to layout plans
- Cross-reference between different track systems
