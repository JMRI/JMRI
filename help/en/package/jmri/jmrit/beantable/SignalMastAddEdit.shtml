<h1>Adding Signal Masts</h1>

<p>
Signal Masts are built based one of the available Signaling Systems, and the Signal Mast Types supported within that system.
<p>
	In the <b>Add Signal Mast</b> window, after entering a User Name for the new Signal Mast, select the JMRI Signal System that the Signal Mast is to be based upon from a pop-up menu.<br/>
	Next select one of the Signal Mast types available in the selected Signal System e.g. "3 Aspect Signal with Call On".
	<h2>Signal Mast Driver</h2>
		<p>
The fourth pop-up menu on the Add Signal Mast panel lets you select one of five different Signal Mast Driver types depending upon the hardware being used:
<ul>
	<li>Signal Head Controlled<br/>
Individual Signal Head objects are used to represent each Signal Head on the Signal Mast. Each Signal Head object will then deal with handling the changing of its Appearance depending upon the state of the Signal Mast and the position of this Signal Head relative to other Heads.
		For each Signal Head that has been defined in the Signaling System for the selected Signal Mast type, a drop down box will appear for you to select the Signal Head ID that will control the Signal Head on this Signal Mast.</li>
	<li>Turnout Controlled<br/>
		This Driver type is for specific hardware that can control the whole Appearance of a Signal Mast based upon the setting of one or more Turnouts. Depending on the hardware used the appropriate options will appear in the setup panel.</li>
		<li>Virtual<br/>
This mast does not directly control any hardware relating to a Signal Mast. It is ideal for locations where a physical mast would not be present on the railroad, such as an End Bumper/Buffer Stop, or to 
			mark the end of a signaling section of track and the beginning of Dark Territory.</li>
	<li><a name="dccsmd">DCC Signal Mast Decoder</a><br/>
			This Driver type is for an accessory decoder that can drive the Signal Masts natively and supports the <a href="http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/standards_rps/rp921.html#Extended%20Accessory%20Decoder%20Control%20Packet%20Format">NMRA Extended Accessory Protocol</a>. When prompted input the Aspect numbers configured in your decoder against each Aspect. The default values for the ID of each Aspect as defined in the Signaling System definition can be over-written. Decoders like the <a href="http://signalist.co.uk">Signalist SC1</a> have Signal Mast types preconfigured and you just select the correct table with a CV and get the Aspect numbers from the manual.
			<li>LNCP Signal Mast Decoder<br/>
				Like the previous option, the LocoNet Control Point (LNCP) Driver type needs only a decoder ID and optionally Aspect ID's to drive a <a href="http://www.rr-cirkits.com/manuals/LNCP-manual.pdf">RR_Cirkits LNCP</a> module.
