      <h1>Adding Signal Masts</h1><a href=

      <p>Signal Masts are configured using one of the available
      Signaling Systems, and the Signal Mast Types supported within
      that system.</p>

      <p>In the <b>Add/Edit Signal Mast</b> panel, after entering a User
      Name for the new Signal Mast, from the pop-up menu select the
      JMRI Signal System the Signal Mast is to be based upon.<br>
      Next select one of the Signal Mast models available in the
      selected Signal System e.g. "3 Aspect Signal with Call
      On".<br>
      The third pop-up menu on the Add Signal Mast panel lets you
      select one of six different Signal Mast Driver types
      depending upon the hardware being used. 
      More on those in the next section.</p>
      
      <p>Options common to (nearly) all Driver types include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>This Mast can be Unlit</b>: checking this box allows JMRI
        to turn off the mast, using an extra instruction such as an
        output state. When configuring a mast that can be unlit,
        the same aspect ID has to be entered in both the field at
        the top as the Aspect line below for the correct appearance
        to be displayed in all possible scenarios.</li>

        <li><b>Disabled</b>: checking this box for an Aspect will grey out
        the options and have JMRI skip it when changing the state
        of this mast</li>

        <li><b>Copy Aspects from Mast</b>: DCC, LNCP and Matrix drivers
        let you copy the settings for a new mast to match an
        already configured mast. Of course the User Name and
        outputs should be unique, so they are not copied.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When ready, click <b>Create new</b> (or <b>Apply</b> when editing an
      existing mast configuration).</p>

        Individual Signal Head objects are used to represent each
        Signal Head on the Signal Mast. Each Signal Head object
        will then deal with handling the changing of its Appearance
        depending upon the state of the Signal Mast and the
        position of this Signal Head relative to other Heads. For
        each head that has been defined in the Signaling System for
        the selected Signal Mast type, a drop down box will appear
        for you to select the JMRI Signal Head that will control
        that head on this Signal Mast.</dd>

        <dd>This Driver type is for specific hardware that can
        control the whole Appearance of a Signal Mast based upon
        the setting of one or more Turnouts. Depending on the
        hardware used the appropriate options will appear in the
        setup panel.</dd>

        This mast does not directly control any hardware relating
        to a Signal Mast. It is ideal for locations where a
        physical mast would not be present on the railroad, such as
        an End Bumper/Buffer Stop, or to mark the end of a
        signaling section of track and the beginning of Dark
        Territory. No commands are sent to the layout, so there's
        no connection to choose.</dd>

        This Driver type is for an accessory decoder that can drive
        the Signal Masts natively and supports the <a href=
        "http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/standards_rps/rp921.html#Extended%20Accessory%20Decoder%20Control%20Packet%20Format">
        NMRA Extended Accessory Protocol</a>. Enter the Aspect
        numbers configured in your decoder against each Aspect. The
        default values for the ID of each Aspect as defined in the
        Signaling System definition can be over-written. Decoders
        like the <a href="http://signalist.co.uk">Signalist SC1</a>
        have Signal Mast types preconfigured and you just select
        the correct table with a CV and get the Aspect numbers from
        the manual.</dd>

        <dt><a name="lncpsmd" id="lncpsmd">LNCP Signal Mast Decoder</a></dt>

        <dd>Like the previous option, the LocoNet Control Point
        (LNCP) Driver type needs only a decoder ID and optionally
        Aspect ID's to drive a <a href=
        "http://www.rr-cirkits.com/manuals/LNCP-manual.pdf">RR_Cirkits
        LNCP</a> module.</dd>

          This Driver creates a truth table to set from 1 to 6
          outputs per Aspect. To define 8 different patterns, you
          will need at least 3 on/off fields. The Output Matrix
          driver was developed to connect decoders configured to
          connect and drive signals, like a <a href=
          "../../../../html/hardware/digirails/index.shtml#dr4018">Digirails
          DR4018</a> with built in aspect mapping set to match your JMRI 
          signal system and mapping.<br>
          When selected from the Driver drop down list, the panel
          lets you:

          <ol>
            <li>Set the number of logic outputs (3 in the screen
            shot, select from the <b>Number of logic outputs</b> drop
            down list).<br>
            The panel is redrawn when you change this number,
            showing as many...</li>

            <li>Output selection boxes. Select or create Turnouts
            as binary outputs.</li>

            <li>For each Aspect, Checkboxes allow you to set the
            corresponding position of the outputs, hence the Matrix name</li>

            <li><span class="since">since 4.15.7</span>Set a mast-specific
              delay that is applied between every output command
            </li>
          </ol>
          
          For now, only turnouts can be
          configured as outputs. Your decoder documentation will
          have to explain which Aspects are available and which
          output states the decoder expects for each Aspect.<br>
          The output names and the Unlit row can be changed later on by
          clicking the <b>Edit</b> button in the Signal Mast table.
          It's not possible to change the number of outputs in the
          matrix once a mast has been saved.
