      <p>Signal Masts are configured using one of the available Signaling Systems, and the Signal
      Mast Types supported within that system.</p>

      <p>In the <strong>Add/Edit Signal Mast</strong> panel, after entering a User Name for the new
      Signal Mast, from the pop-up menu select the JMRI Signal System the Signal Mast is to be
      based upon.<br>
      Next select one of the Signal Mast models available in the selected Signal System e.g. "3
      Aspect Signal with Call On".<br>
      The third pop-up menu on the Add Signal Mast panel lets you select one of six different
      Signal Mast Driver types depending upon the hardware being used. More on those in the next
      section.</p>

      <p>Options common to (nearly) all Driver types include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>This Mast can be Unlit</strong>: checking this box allows JMRI to turn off the
        mast, using an extra instruction such as an output state. When configuring a mast that can
        be unlit, the same aspect ID has to be entered in both the field at the top as the Aspect
        line below for the correct appearance to be displayed in all possible scenarios.</li>

        <li><strong>Disabled</strong>: checking this box for an Aspect will gray out the options
        and have JMRI skip it when changing the state of this mast</li>

        <li><strong>Copy Aspects from Mast</strong>: DCC, LNCP and Matrix drivers let you copy the
        settings for a new mast to match an already configured mast. Of course the User Name and
        outputs should be unique, so they are not copied.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When ready, click <strong>Create new</strong> (or <strong>Apply</strong> when editing an
      existing mast configuration).</p>

          Individual Signal Head objects are used to represent each Signal Head on the Signal
          Mast.<br>
          Each Signal Head object will then deal with handling the changing of its Appearance
          depending upon the state of the Signal Mast and the position of this Signal Head relative
          to other Heads.<br>
          For each head that has been defined in the Signaling System for the selected Signal Mast
          type, a drop down box will appear for you to select the JMRI Signal Head that will
          control that head on this Signal Mast.

          "Turnout Controlled Signal Mast driver panel"></a><br>
          This Driver type is for specific hardware that can control the whole Appearance of a
          Signal Mast based upon the setting of one or more <a href=
          "../../../../html/tools/Turnouts.shtml" title="JMRI Turnouts">Turnouts</a>.<br>
          Each aspect can be configured to send the Thrown or Closed Turnout state.<br>
          Leave the <q>Reset Previous Aspect</q> unchecked if the Turnout event also clears
          previous aspects on a remote module.

          This mast does not directly control any hardware relating to a Signal Mast.<br>
          It is ideal for locations where a physical mast would not be present on the railroad,
          such as an End Bumper/Buffer Stop, or to mark the end of a signaling section of track and
          the beginning of Dark Territory.<br>
          No commands are sent to the layout, so there's no connection to choose.

          This Driver type is for an accessory decoder that can drive the Signal Masts natively and
          supports the <a href=
          "https://www.nmra.org/index-nmra-standards-and-recommended-practices">NMRA Extended
          Accessory Protocol S-9.2.1</a>.<br>

          Enter the Aspect numbers configured in your decoder against each Aspect. The default
          values for the ID of each Aspect as defined in the Signaling System definition can be
          over-written.<br>

          Decoders like the <a href="http://signalist.co.uk">Signalist SC1</a> have Signal Mast
          types preconfigured and you just select the correct table with a CV and get the Aspect
          numbers from the manual.<br>

          <span class="since">since 4.25.4</span>Some DCC Signal decoders, such as the
          <strong>NCE Light-It</strong>, use an alternate addressing scheme. The <strong>OffSet
          Address</strong> checkbox is used to enable alternate addressing.

        <dt id="lncpsmd">LNCP Signal Mast Decoder</dt>

        <dd>
          Like the previous option, the LocoNet Control Point (LNCP) Driver type needs only a
          decoder ID and optionally Aspect ID's to drive a <a href=
          "https://www.rr-cirkits.com/manuals/LNCP-manual.pdf">RR_Cirkits LNCP</a> module.

          This Driver creates a truth table to set from 1 to 6 outputs per Aspect. To define 8
          different patterns, you will need at least 3 on/off fields.<br>
          The Output Matrix driver was developed to connect decoders configured to connect and
          drive signals, like a <a href=
          "../../../../html/hardware/digirails/index.shtml#dr4018">Digirails DR4018</a> with built
          in aspect mapping set to match your JMRI signal system and mapping.<br>
          When selected from the Driver drop down list, the panel lets you:
          <ol>
            <li>Set the number of logic outputs (3 in the screen shot, select from the
            <strong>Number of logic outputs</strong> drop down list).<br>
            The panel is redrawn when you change this number, showing as many...</li>

            <li>Output selection boxes. Select or create Turnouts as binary outputs.</li>

            <li>For each Aspect, Checkboxes allow you to set the corresponding position of the
            outputs, hence the Matrix name</li>

            <li><span class="since">since 4.15.7</span>Set a mast-specific delay that is applied
            between every output command</li>
          </ol>
          For now, only turnouts can be configured as outputs. Your decoder documentation will have
          to explain which Aspects are available and which output states the decoder expects for
          each Aspect.<br>
          The output names and the Unlit row can be changed later on by clicking the
          <strong>Edit</strong> button in the Signal Mast table. It's not possible to change the
          number of outputs in the matrix once a mast has been saved.

      Table.</p>
