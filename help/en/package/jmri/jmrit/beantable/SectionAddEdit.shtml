      <h1>Adding/Editing Sections</h1><a name="addSection" id=
      "addSection"></a>

      <h2>Adding a new Section</h2>

      <p>To add a new Section, follow this procedure:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click <b><a href="SectionTable.shtml">Sections</a></b>
          in the <b>Tables</b> submenu of the <b>Tools</b> menu to
          bring up the Section Table.<br>
          At bottom left, click the <b>Add...</b>
          button at the bottom of the table to bring up the
          Add Section pane:</p><img src=
          "images/SectionAddFrame.png" height="708" width="693">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter a <b>System Name</b>, according to the JMRI
          convention. Since Sections are internal objects, the
          first letter should be "I" (for internal). The second
          letter should be "Y" to indicate a Section. This is
          usually followed by a number, but the program will accept
          any numeric or alphabetic characters. The system name
          must be different from the System Name of other Sections.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter a <b>User Name</b>. Any string of characters
          that is different from the User Name of other Sections
          will be accepted, but it's wise to use a string that
          describes the intended use of the Section.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Next add <b>Blocks</b> to the Section. Every Section
          must have at least one Block, but may have more. Blocks
          must be connected,and must be entered in order. Select
          the Block you would like to begin the Section in the
          popup menu. At any point during Block addition, the popup
          menu lists only those Blocks that are eligible for
          addition. Click <b>Add Selected Block</b> to add the
          first block of the Section.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the Section is to have multiple Blocks, add more
          Blocks in the same manner. Select the Block to be added
          in the popup menu, and click <b>Add Selected Block</b>.
          Important Note: The order Blocks are added determines the
          <b>FORWARD</b> and <b>REVERSE</b> directions of the
          Section. The FORWARD direction is from the top Block to
          the bottom Block. If at any time you decide you want to
          start over, click <b>Clear Blocks from Section</b> to clear the
          table of Blocks, and return to step 4 above.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Next set the <b>Travel Direction</b> of each <b>Entry
          Point</b> to the Section. As Blocks were entered, the
          program gathered a list of all the Entry Points to the
          new Section. In the <b>Block Entered From</b> column, all
          Blocks not in the Section, but connected to Blocks in the
          Section are listed. For each Block, the System Name and
          User Name (in parenthesis) are shown, followed by the
          Path direction. Normally Path direction may be ignored,
          but if there are two Entry Points from the same Block,
          Path direction should allow you to identify which is
          which.</p>

          <p><b>Travel Direction</b> column entries are popup menus
          that must be set to FORWARD if a train entering the
          Section from that Block will be traveling in the FORWARD
          direction in the Section, or set to REVERSE if a train
          entering from that Block will be traveling in the REVERSE
          direction in the Section. Note: Don't confuse FORWARD and
          REVERSE directions in a Section, with forward and reverse
          settings on a throttle--they are two different
          things.</p>

          <p>Where possible, the program entered FORWARD or REVERSE
          for you. If it couldn't determine direction
          unambiguously, it entered <b>UNKNOWN</b>. You must assign
          all UNKNOWN Travel Directions before the new Section can
          be created. Important Note: <b>Travel Direction
          assignments must be consistent.</b> If the new Section
          has only one Block, it's not important which direction
          you choose as FORWARD, but once you make that choice, all
          assignments must conform to it. If the new Section has
          multiple Blocks, the FORWARD direction is the direction a
          train would travel if moving from the top Block toward
          the bottom Block.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you are using <b>Direction Sensors</b>, enter the
          names of your <b>Forward Sensor</b> and <b>Reverse
          Sensor</b> in the designated fields. These sensors are
          usually internal sensors (beginning with "IS" in their
          system name). If you haven't yet created the sensors,
          enter their system names, and entries will be made in the
          Sensor Table for those sensors. More information on
          direction sensors and their use is given in the <a href=
          "SectionTable.shtml">Sections Table help</a>. If
          direction sensors are not needed, leave the fields
          blank--you can always add them later via the Edit
          function.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you are using <b>Stopping Sensors</b>, enter the
          names of your <b>Forward Stopping Sensor</b> and
          <b>Reverse Stopping Sensor</b> in the designated fields.
          These sensors are physical sensors on the layout that go
          active when a train has reached the end of the Section
          when traveling in the FORWARD direction or the REVERSE
          direction. If you haven't yet created entries for these
          sensors in the Sensor Table, enter their system names,
          and entries will be added to the Sensor Table. More
          information on stopping sensors and their use is given in
          the <a href="SectionTable.shtml">Sections Table help</a>.
          If stopping sensors are not needed, leave the
          fields blank--you can always add them later via the Edit
          function.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the
          window. If everything is fine, the window will close and
          a new Section will appear in the Section Table. If there
          is trouble with anything, a message will be displayed
          indicating the error and what you should do to fix it.
          Correct the error and click <b>Create</b> again.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <a name='editsection' id="editsection"></a>
      <h2>Editing an existing Section</h2>
      <p>To edit an existing Section, follow this procedure:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click a Section's <b>Edit</b> button in the <a href=
          "SectionTable.shtml">Section Table</a> to bring up the
          Edit Section pane. The window will be the same as
          that shown above, except the System Name will be fixed,
          and the <b>Create</b> button will be replaced by an
          <b>Update</b> Button.</p>
          <img src="images/SectionEditFrame.png" height="179" width="693">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Make whatever changes or additions you need to the
          information in the window. Note that the System Name of
          the edited Section may not be changed, but the User Name
          may be changed. Items that may be edited are described
          <a href="#addSection">above</a> in steps 3 through 8 in
          the procedure for adding a new Section.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>After making changes to the Section information, click
          <b>Update</b> to change the selected Section. If
          everything is fine, the window will close. If there is
          any trouble, a message will be displayed indicating the
          error and what you should do to fix it. Correct the error
          and click <b>Update</b> again.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit without changing the
        selected Section. If the Add/Edit Section window is
        dismissed (closed) while editing, <b>Cancel</b> is
        automatically selected, and no changes are made to the
        selected Section.</li>
