      <h2 id="addSection">Adding a new Section</h2>

      <p>To add a new Section, follow this procedure:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click <strong><a href="SectionTable.shtml">Sections</a></strong> in the
          <strong>Tables</strong> submenu of the <strong>Tools</strong> menu to bring up the
          Section Table.<br>
          At bottom left, click the <strong>Add...</strong> button at the bottom of the table to
          bring up the Add Section pane:</p>
          <img src="images/SectionAddFrame.png" height="705" width="784" alt="Section add frame">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter a <strong>System Name</strong>, according to the JMRI convention. Since Sections
          are internal objects, the first letter should be "I" (for internal). The second letter
          should be "Y" to indicate a Section. This is usually followed by a number, but the
          program will accept any numeric or alphabetic characters. The system name must be
          different from the System Name of other Sections.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter a <strong>User Name</strong>. Any string of characters that is different from
          the User Name of other Sections will be accepted, but it's wise to use a string that
          describes the intended use of the Section.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Next add <strong>Blocks</strong> to the Section. Every Section must have at least one
          Block, but may have more. Blocks must be connected,and must be entered in order. Select
          the Block you would like to begin the Section in the popup menu. At any point during
          Block addition, the popup menu lists only those Blocks that are eligible for addition.
          Click <strong>Add Selected Block</strong> to add the first block of the Section.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the Section is to have multiple Blocks, add more Blocks in the same manner. Select
          the Block to be added in the popup menu, and click <strong>Add Selected Block</strong>.
          Important Note: The order Blocks are added determines the <strong>FORWARD</strong> and
          <strong>REVERSE</strong> directions of the Section. The FORWARD direction is from the top
          Block to the bottom Block. If at any time you decide you want to start over, click
          <strong>Clear Blocks from Section</strong> to clear the table of Blocks, and return to
          step 4 above.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Next set the <strong>Travel Direction</strong> of each <strong>Entry Point</strong> to
          the Section. As Blocks were entered, the program gathered a list of all the Entry Points
          to the new Section. In the <strong>Block Entered From</strong> column, all Blocks not in
          the Section, but connected to Blocks in the Section are listed. For each Block, the
          bblock name is shown, followed by the Path direction. Normally Path direction may be
          ignored, but if there are two Entry Points from the same Block, Path direction should
          allow you to identify which is which.</p>

          <p><strong>Travel Direction</strong> column entries are popup menus that must be set to
          FORWARD if a train entering the Section from that Block will be traveling in the FORWARD
          direction in the Section, or set to REVERSE if a train entering from that Block will be
          traveling in the REVERSE direction in the Section. Note: Don't confuse FORWARD and
          REVERSE directions in a Section, with forward and reverse settings on a throttle--they
          are two different things.</p>

          <p>Where possible, the program entered FORWARD or REVERSE for you. If it couldn't
          determine direction unambiguously, it entered <strong>UNKNOWN</strong>. You must assign
          all UNKNOWN Travel Directions before the new Section can be created. Important Note:
          <strong>Travel Direction assignments must be consistent.</strong> If the new Section has
          only one Block, it's not important which direction you choose as FORWARD, but once you
          make that choice, all assignments must conform to it. If the new Section has multiple
          Blocks, the FORWARD direction is the direction a train would travel if moving from the
          top Block toward the bottom Block.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you are using <strong>Direction Sensors</strong>, select the names of your
          <strong>Forward Sensor</strong> and <strong>Reverse Sensor</strong> from the designated
          dropdown boxes. These sensors are usually internal sensors. More information on direction
          sensors and their use is given in the <a href=
          "../../../../html/tools/Sections.shtml">Sections Documentation</a>. If direction sensors
          are not needed, leave the fields blank--you can always add them later via the Edit
          function.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you are using <strong>Stopping Sensors</strong>, select the names of your
          <strong>Forward Stopping Sensor</strong> and <strong>Reverse Stopping Sensor</strong>
          from the designated dropdown boxes. These sensors are physical sensors on the layout that
          go active when a train has reached the end of the Section when traveling in the FORWARD
          direction or the REVERSE direction. More information on stopping sensors and their use is
          given in the <a href="../../../../html/tools/Sections.shtml">Sections Documentation</a>.
          If stopping sensors are not needed, leave the fields blank--you can always add them later
          via the Edit function.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Click the <strong>Create</strong> button at the bottom of the window. If everything is
          fine, the window will close and a new Section will appear in the Section Table. If there
          is trouble with anything, a message will be displayed indicating the error and what you
          should do to fix it. Correct the error and click <strong>Create</strong> again.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="editsection">Editing an existing Section</h2>

      <p>To edit an existing Section, follow this procedure:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click a Section's <strong>Edit</strong> button in the <a href=
          "SectionTable.shtml">Section Table</a> to bring up the Edit Section pane. The window will
          be the same as that shown above, except the System Name will be fixed, and the
          <strong>Create</strong> button will be replaced by an <strong>Update</strong> Button.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Make whatever changes or additions you need to the information in the window. Note
          that the System Name of the edited Section may not be changed, but the User Name may be
          changed. Items that may be edited are described <a href="#addSection">above</a> in steps
          3 through 8 in the procedure for adding a new Section.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>After making changes to the Section information, click <strong>Update</strong> to
          change the selected Section. If everything is fine, the window will close. If there is
          any trouble, a message will be displayed indicating the error and what you should do to
          fix it. Correct the error and click <strong>Update</strong> again.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Click <strong>Cancel</strong> to exit without changing the selected Section. If the
        Add/Edit Section window is dismissed (closed) while editing, <strong>Cancel</strong> is
        automatically selected, and no changes are made to the selected Section.</li>
      </ol>
