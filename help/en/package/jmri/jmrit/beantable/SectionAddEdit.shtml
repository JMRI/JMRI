<a name="addSection">
<H2>Adding a new Section</H2></a>

<p>To add a new Section, follow this procedure:
<ol>
<li><p>Click <b><a href="SectionTable.shtml">Sections</a></b> in the 
<b>Tables</b> submenu of the <b>Tools</b> menu to bring up
the Section Table, and click the <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom of the 
table to bring up the Add/Edit Section window.</p>
<img src="SectionAddFrame.jpg" height="591" width="638">
<li><p>Enter a <b>System Name</b>, according to the JMRI convention. Since Sections 
are internal objects, the first letter should be "I" (for internal). The second 
letter should be "Y" to indicate a Section. This is usually followed by a 
number, but the program will accept any numeric or alphabetic characters. The 
system name must be different from the System Name of other Sections. JMRI will 
force all alphabetic characters in the System Name to upper case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter a <b>User Name</b>. Any string of characters that is different 
from the User Name of other Sections will be accepted, but it's 
wise to use a string that describes the intended use of the Section.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next add <b>Blocks</b> to the Section.  Every Section must have at least 
one Block, but may have more. Blocks must be connected,and must be entered in 
order. Select the Block you would like to begin the Section in the popup menu. 
At any point during Block addition, the popup menu lists only those Blocks that 
are eligible for addition. Click <b>Add Selected Block</b> to add the first block of 
the Section.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the Section is to have multiple Blocks, add more Blocks in the same
manner. Select the Block to be added in the popup menu, and click <b>Add Selected 
Block</b>. Important Note: The order Blocks are added determines the <b>FORWARD</b> 
and <b>REVERSE</b> directions of the Section. The FORWARD direction is from the top 
Block to the bottom Block. If at any time you decide you want to start over, 
click <b>Delete All Blocks</b> to clear the table of Blocks, and return to 
step 4 above.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next set the <b>Travel Direction</b> of each <b>Entry Point</b> to the 
Section. As Blocks were entered, the program gathered a list of all the 
Entry Points to the new Section. In the <b>Block Entered From</b> column, all 
Blocks not in the Section, but connected to Blocks in the Section are listed. 
For each Block, the System Name and User Name (in parenthesis) are shown, 
followed by the Path direction.  Normally Path direction may be ignored, 
but if there are two Entry Points from the same Block, Path direction should 
allow you to identify which is which.</p>
<p><b>Travel Direction</b> column entries are popup menus that must be set to 
FORWARD if a train entering the Section from that Block will be traveling in 
the FORWARD direction in the Section, or set to REVERSE if a train entering from 
that Block will be traveling in the REVERSE direction in the Section. Note: Don't 
confuse FORWARD and REVERSE directions in a Section, with forward and reverse 
settings on a throttle--they are two different things.</p>
<p>Where possible, the program entered FORWARD or REVERSE for you. If it couldn't 
determine direction unambiguously, it entered <b>UNKNOWN</b>. You must assign 
all UNKNOWN Travel Directions before the new Section can be created. Important 
Note: <b>Travel Direction assignments must be consistent.</b> If the new Section 
has only one Block, it's not important which direction you choose as FORWARD, but 
once you make that choice, all assignments must conform to it. If the new 
Section has multiple Blocks, the FORWARD direction is the direction a train 
would travel if moving from the top Block toward the bottom Block.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are using <b>Direction Sensors</b>, enter the names of your 
<b>Forward Sensor</b> and <b>Reverse Sensor</b> in the designated fields. These 
sensors are usually internal sensors (beginning with "IS" in their system name). 
If you haven't yet created the sensors, enter their system names, and entries will 
be made in the Sensors Table for those sensors. More information on direction 
sensors and their use is given in the <a href="SectionTable.shtml">Sections 
Table help file</a>. If direction sensors are not needed, leave the fields 
blank--you can always add them later via the Edit function.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are using <b>Stopping Sensors</b>, enter the names of your 
<b>Forward Stopping Sensor</b> and <b>Reverse Stopping Sensor</b> in the 
designated fields. These sensors are physical sensors on the layout that 
go active when a train has reached the end of the Section when traveling in 
the FORWARD direction or the REVERSE direction. If you haven't yet created entries 
for these sensors in the Sensors Table, enter their system names, and entries will 
be added to the Sensors Table. More information on stopping 
sensors and their use is given in the <a href="SectionTable.shtml">Sections 
Table help file</a>. If stopping sensors are not needed, leave the fields 
blank--you can always add them later via the Edit function.</p>
</li><li><p>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the window.  
If everything is fine, the window will close and a new Section will appear in 
the Sections Table. If there is trouble with anything, a message will be 
displayed indicating the error and what you should do to fix it. 
Correct the error and click <b>Create</b> again.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Editing an existing Section</h2>
To edit an existing Section, follow  this procedure:
<ol>
<li><p>Click a Section's <b>Edit</b> button in the <a href="SectionTable.shtml">
Sections Table</a> to bring up the Add/Edit Section window. The window will 
be the same as that shown above, except the System Name will be fixed, and 
the <b>Create</b> button will be replaced with an <b>Update</b> Button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make whatever changes or additions you need to the information in
the window. Note that the System Name of the edited Section may not be 
changed, but the User Name may be changed. Items that may be edited are described 
<a href="#addSection">above</a> in steps 3 through 8 in the procedure for adding 
a new Section.</p></li>
<li><p>After making changes to the Section information, click <b>Update</b> 
to change the selected Section.  If everything is fine, the window will close.
If there is any trouble, a message will be displayed indicating the error and 
what you should do to fix it. Correct the error and click <b>Update</b> again.</p>
</li>
<li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit without changing the selected Section. 
If the Add/Edit Section window is dismissed (closed) while editing, <b>Cancel</b> 
is automatically selected, and no changes are made to the selected Section.
</li>
</ol>
