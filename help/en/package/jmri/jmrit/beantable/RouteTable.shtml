      <h1>The Route Table</h1>

      <p>A Route consists of one or more Turnouts or Sensors that
      you would like to control. Before creating a Route, you
      should first add some Turnouts or Sensors by using either the
      Turnout Table or Sensors Table. These tables can be found
      under the main menu "Tools -&gt; Tables".</p>

      <p>Once you have some Turnouts or Sensors set up, use the
      "Add..." button in the lower left hand corner of the Route
      Table pane to create a new Route.</p>

      <h2>Route Table Columns</h2>
      (You may change the order of the columns by dragging their titles,
      and sort the rows by clicking one of the sort triangles next to a column title)
      <dl>
        <dt>System Name</dt>

        <dd>The System Name cannot be changed once entered into the
        table. The "Add..." button located in the lower left corner
        of the pane allows you to add a new Route to the
        table.</dd>

        <dt>User Name</dt>

        <dd>You can directly enter or change the User Name for an
        existing Route.</dd>

        <dt>Set</dt>

        <dd>Pushing the "Set" button will trigger an existing
        Route.</dd>

        <dt>Delete</dt>

        <dd>
          Pushing the "Delete" button will remove the route from
          the table.

          <p>Note that this doesn't remove the Route from any files
          you've saved that contain it. If you load one of those
          files, perhaps when you restart the program, the Route
          will reappear. You should use one of the "Store to file"
          options in the "File" menu to save new versions of any
          files that contain this route.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Enabled</dt>

        <dd>To disable a Route from triggering, uncheck the
        "Enabled" box for the Route. Enabled is not saved and will
        be restored when a Panel is loaded at startup.</dd>

        <dt>Locked</dt>

        <dd>When checked the Route is locked. This means that
        Turnouts included in the Route that can be locked by JMRI
        will not respond to commands from cabs or pushbuttons to
        change. For more information see the <a href=
        "TurnoutTable.shtml#Lock%20Mode">Lock Mode section</a> on
        the <a href="TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table help
        page</a> and the Route Add/Edit <a href=
        "RouteAddEdit.shtml#Turnout%20lock%20feature">Turnout Lock
        feature</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Edit</dt>

        <dd>Push one of these buttons to edit that Route. For more
        information see <a href="RouteAddEdit.shtml">Adding/Editing
        Routes</a>.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Route Table Controls</h2>There is a button at the bottom
      of the Route Table:

      <dl>
        <dt>Add...</dt>

        <dd>Push this button to add a new route. For more
        information see <a href="RouteAddEdit.shtml">Adding/Editing
        Routes</a>.</dd>
      </dl>
