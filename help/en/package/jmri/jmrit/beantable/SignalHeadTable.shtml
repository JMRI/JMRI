<h1>The Signal Head Table</h1>

<p>All the Signal Heads that JMRI knows about can be referenced
using the "Signal Head Table" tool in the Tools menu of most JMRI
programs. Signal Heads are also referenced to build Signal Masts in
a later step. There are eight columns in the Signal Head Table:</p>
<ol>
<li>The System Name is assigned to the Signal Head when it's
created, and can't be changed later.</li>
<li>If you're interested in having your Signal Heads carry "human
readable" names, you can doubleclick in the "User Name" column and
change that information to whatever you want.</li>
<li>As the Signal Head changes, for whatever reason, the current
Appearance will show in the table in the "State" column. You can
also click on a State button to cycle through the available
appearances: Red, Yellow, Green, Flashing red, Flashing Yellow,
Flashing Green, and Dark. Some Signal Heads may also have Lunar and
Flashing Lunar available.</li>
<li>The "Comment" column is for your use to record any comment you
may want to help keep track of your Signal Heads. It is for
information only. Doubleclick to edit the contents.</li>
<li>Click the "Delete" button in a specific row to delete the
Signal Head. Be sure to first remove any Signal Head icons
associated with this Signal Head, any associated Simple Signal
Logic, and all references to this Signal Head. Use this button with
caution!</li>
<li>The check box in the "Lit" column lets you control whether the
Signal Head on the layout is lit (checked) or stays dark
(unchecked).</li>
<li>The check box in the "Held" column shows the "held" property of
the Signal Head, and allows you to change it. This property is used
by e.g. CTC machine logic to say "Don't change this Signal Head
from red, even if it would be safe to do so, because I want to hold
a train here".</li>
<li>Click the "Edit" button in a row to view or change optional
information for a Signal Head.<br>
Notes: System Name and Signal type cannot be changed. Only one
Signal Head may be edited at a time.</li>
</ol>
<p>To define a new Signal Head, click on the "<a href=
"SignalAddEdit.shtml">Add.."</a> button at the bottom of the Signal
Head Table. It will prompt you for the Signal Head connection type
and whatever information is needed.</p>
<p>Use the Store item in the File menu to save signal information
to disk. This information is saved with the configuration in an XML
file, along with control panel setup and similar stuff. To store
your panels in the same file (recommended), select <b>File &gt;
Store &gt; Store Configuration and Panels To File...</b> or select
<b>Panels &gt; Save Panels...</b> in the main JMRI window.</p>
<p>For more information on creating and displaying panels,
including how to show signals on your panels, please see the
<a href="../../../../html/apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels
pages</a>.</p>
