      <h1>Transit Actions</h1>

      <h2>What are Actions?</h2>

      <p>Transit <b>Actions</b> are tasks that can be initiated
      automatically as a Train, running in automatic mode,
      traverses the layout following a <b><a href=
      "TransitTable.shtml">Transit</a></b>. One or more
      <b>Actions</b> may be requested for each <b><a href=
      "SectionTable.shtml">Section</a></b> in a Transit. If a
      Section is in a Transit multiple times, different
      <b>Actions</b> may be specified for each occurrence of the
      Section.<br>
      <b>Actions</b> only apply to trains run automatically under
      <b><a href=
      "../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b> by a
      <i>virtual engineer</i>. If running Trains in automatic mode
      is of interest, please read on. If your trains will only be run
      manually with a human engineer, <b>Actions</b> aren't
      used.</p>

      <p><b>Actions</b> are set in addition to the <i>standard
      actions</i> that happen automatically when a Train runs in
      automatic mode. Standard actions are things like following
      signals and using stop sensors that are specified with each
      Section. <i>Standard actions</i> occur automatically whenever
      a Section is traversed in automatic mode. Other <i>standard
      actions</i> include automatically requesting allocation of
      Sections, and automatically changing locomotive speed
      according to signal restrictions.</p>

      <p>Special <b>Actions</b> are tied to Sections, but are specified at
      the Transit level to provide maximum user flexibility. A
      Section is a piece of physical track that may, for example,
      be used by passenger trains, through freight trains, or
      locals. Each of these uses may need different <b>Actions</b>
      in a specific Section. For example, a passenger train may
      make a station stop in a particular Section, whereas a
      through freight train may go straight through. Adding
      special <b>Actions</b> to Transits allows Active Trains
      traveling the same path through the layout to have different
      <b>Actions</b>.</p>

      <h2>Requesting an Action</h2>

      <p>An Action is requested by specifying <b><i>when</i></b> an
      action is to be performed and <b><i>what</i></b> action to be
      performed. Any <b><i>When</i></b> event may be combined
      with any <b><i>What</i></b> action. This flexibility provides
      for a wide variety of Special Actions.
      An Action is initiated when the Train enters the Section with
      the Action request. To decide <i>when</i> to perform the
      Action after the Section is entered, the program looks at the
      <b><i>When</i></b> event.</p>

      <img src="images/AddEditAction.png" width="322" height="247">

      <a id="when" name="when"></a>
      <h3>When to take action?</h3>

      <p>Available <b><i><a href=
      "AddEditAction.shtml#when">When</a></i></b> event choices are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>On Section Entry</b></li>
        <li><b>On Section Exit</b></li>
        <li><b>On Block Entry</b></li>
        <li><b>On Block Exit</b></li>
        <li><b>On Train Stop</b></li>
        <li><b>On Train Start</b></li>
        <li><b>On Sensor ACTIVE</b></li>
        <li><b>On Sensor INACTIVE</b></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Optionally a <b>Delay</b> may be set for each
      <b><i>When</i></b> event, specified in milliseconds.
      If the Delay time is set to zero (the default),
      the action will be performed immediately after the
      <b><i>When</i></b> event occurs. If a Delay time is
      specified, the program will wait for the specified time in
      fast clock minutes after the <b><i>When</i></b> event occurs
      before performing the action.</p>

      <a id="what" name="what"></a>
      <h3>What action to perform?</h3>

      <p>Available <b><i>What</i></b> actions are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Pause Train</b> - Stop the Train for a specified
        number of fast clock minutes. This item may be used to
        request a station stop. Set the duration in fast clock
        minutes using the spinner.</li>

        <li><b>Set Maximum Speed</b> - Set the maximum speed to a
        specified percentage of the maximum hardware speed.<br>When
        a Train is run in automatic mode, the program will never
        exceed this maximum speed. For example, this item may be
        used to force an automatic train to run slower through a
        town. Setting maximum speed does not affect the current
        speed of the Train if it is less than the specified maximum
        speed (percentage).<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatMaxSpeed.png" height="169" width="461">
        </li>

        <li><b>Set Train Speed</b> - Set the current train speed to
        the target percentage. The throttle will send the new speed
        to the locomotive after the delay set under When.<br>
        How long it takes the Train to reach the new speed after
        that depends upon the locomotive decoder.
        The new speed may be either lower or higher than the
        previous value, but will not be allowed to exceed the
        maximum speed.</li>

        <li><b>Ramp Train Speed</b> - Set the current train speed
        to the target percentage by ramping to the target value
        using the default ramp rate of the automatically running
        Train. If the default ramp rate of the Train is RAMP_NONE,
        this action is equivalent to <b>Set Train Speed</b>. The
        new speed may be either lower or higher than the previous
        value, but will not be allowed to exceed the maximum
        speed.</li>

        <li><b>Go to Manual Mode</b> - Drop out of automatic mode
        to allow a human engineer to perform work with a manual
        throttle. This action supports the scenario where a Train
        might be run automatically to a work site, where a human
        operator takes over to perform work, after which automatic
        running is continued. The Train will remain in manual mode
        until directed by the dispatcher to resume automatic
        operation. An optional <b>Done Sensor</b> allows an
        operator remote from the dispatcher to notify the
        dispatcher that work has been completed and automatic
        running can be resumed. When the <b>Done Sensor</b> goes
        active, the status of the Train is changed from WORKING to
        READY. For more information on this action, see <b><a href=
        "../dispatcher/DispatcherFrame.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b>.
        <b>Note:</b> When the Train is in manual mode, the computer
        does not have a throttle for the train available, so
        delayed actions that happen then and require a throttle are
        ignored.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatManual.png" height="169" width="460">
        </li>

        <li><b>Set Locomotive Light</b> - Sets the locomotive light
        either <i>On</i> or <i>Off</i> as selected.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatLight.png" height="167" width="461">
        </li>

        <li><b>Start Bell</b> - Start bell ringing on a sound
        decoder. This item will turn throttle function 1 on.</li>

        <li><b>Stop Bell</b> - Stop bell ringing on a sound
        decoder. This item will turn throttle function 1 off.</li>

        <li><b>Sound Horn</b> - Sound the horn (whistle) of a sound
        decoder for a specified time. This item is equivalent to
        holding down throttle function 2 for the specified
        time.</li>

        <li><b>Pattern Sound Horn</b> - Sound the horn (whistle) in
        a manner specified by a user-entered pattern. The pattern
        consists of short and long blasts, specified as "s" and "l"
        in the pattern. For example, a pattern of "lsl" specifies
        long-short-long. Sets the duration of the short and long
        blasts using the two spinners (milliseconds).
        The short blast duration is also used as the
        wait time between blasts. Actual times realized will depend
        on the sound decoder and how busy the computer is. The
        horn/whistle is assumed to be throttle function 2.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatPattern.png" height="171" width="460">
        </li>

        <li><b>Set Decoder Function</b> - Sets the specified
        decoder function either <i>On</i> or <i>Off</i> as
        selected. This works for both sound decoders and decoders
        without sound.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatFunction.png" height="129" width="460">
        </li>

        <li><b>Set Sensor ACTIVE</b> - Set a specified Sensor
        active. Select a Sensor from the drop down (Sensor Table).
        If the specified Sensor is already in the Active state, it
        is first toggled to the Inactive state, then set Active.
        This action may be used, for example, with an internal
        Sensor to trigger a Logix, set a Route, or set a Light.
        It offers access to a wide variety of actions not included
        here, such as running scripts or playing sounds.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatSensor.png" height="132" width="459">
        </li>

        <li><b>Set Sensor INACTIVE</b> - Set a specified Sensor
        inactive. Select a Sensor from the drop down (Sensor Table).
        If the specified Sensor is already in the inactive state,
        it is first toggled to the active state, then set inactive.
        This is equivalent to the action above, except with a
        different target Sensor state.</li>

        <li><b>Hold Signal</b> - Set a specified Signal Mast or
        Signal Head to HELD. Select either a Signal Mast or
        Head from one of the drop downs.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatHold.png" height="151" width="424">
        </li>

        <li><b>Release Signal</b> - Set a specified Signal Mast or
        Signal Head to NOT HELD. Select either a Signal Mast or
        Head from one of the drop downs.</li>
      </ul>
