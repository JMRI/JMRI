      <h1>Transit Actions</h1>

      <h2>What are Actions?</h2>

      <p>Transit <strong>Actions</strong> are tasks that can be initiated automatically as a Train,
      running in automatic mode, traverses the layout following a <strong><a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Transits.shtml">Transit</a></strong>. One or more
      <strong>Actions</strong> may be requested for each <strong><a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Sections.shtml">Section</a></strong> in a Transit. If a Section is in
      a Transit multiple times, different <strong>Actions</strong> may be specified for each
      occurrence of the Section.<br>
      <strong>Actions</strong> only apply to trains run automatically under <strong><a href=
      "../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></strong> by a <em>virtual engineer</em>. If
      running Trains in automatic mode is of interest, please read on. If your trains will only be
      run manually with a human engineer, <strong>Actions</strong> aren't used.</p>

      <p><strong>Actions</strong> are set in addition to the <em>standard actions</em> that happen
      automatically when a Train runs in automatic mode. Standard actions are things like following
      signals and using stop sensors that are specified with each Section. <em>Standard
      actions</em> occur automatically whenever a Section is traversed in automatic mode. Other
      <em>standard actions</em> include automatically requesting allocation of Sections, and
      automatically changing locomotive speed according to signal restrictions.</p>

      <p>Special <strong>Actions</strong> are tied to Sections, but are specified at the Transit
      level to provide maximum user flexibility. A Section is a piece of physical track that may,
      for example, be used by passenger trains, through freight trains, or locals. Each of these
      uses may need different <strong>Actions</strong> in a specific Section. For example, a
      passenger train may make a station stop in a particular Section, whereas a through freight
      train may go straight through. Adding special <strong>Actions</strong> to Transits allows
      Active Trains traveling the same path through the layout to have different
      <strong>Actions</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Requesting an Action</h2>

      <p>An Action is requested by specifying <strong><em>when</em></strong> an action is to be
      performed and <strong><em>what</em></strong> action to be performed. Any
      <strong><em>When</em></strong> event may be combined with any <strong><em>What</em></strong>
      action. This flexibility provides for a wide variety of Special Actions. An Action is
      initiated when the Train enters the Section with the Action request. To decide <em>when</em>
      to perform the Action after the Section is entered, the program looks at the
      <strong><em>When</em></strong> event.</p>
      <img src="images/AddEditAction.png" width="322" height="247" alt="Add action">
      <h3 id="when">When to take action?</h3>

      <p>Available <strong><em><a href="AddEditAction.shtml#when">When</a></em></strong> event
      choices are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>On Section Entry</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>On Section Exit</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>On Block Entry</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>On Block Exit</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>On Train Stop</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>On Train Start</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>On Sensor ACTIVE</strong>
        </li>

        <li><strong>On Sensor INACTIVE</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Optionally a <strong>Delay</strong> may be set for each <strong><em>When</em></strong>
      event, specified in milliseconds. If the Delay time is set to zero (the default), the action
      will be performed immediately after the <strong><em>When</em></strong> event occurs. If a
      Delay time is specified, the program will wait for the specified time in fast clock minutes
      after the <strong><em>When</em></strong> event occurs before performing the action.</p>

      <h3 id="what">What action to perform?</h3>

      <p>Available <strong><em>What</em></strong> actions are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pause Train</strong> - Stop the Train for a specified number of fast clock
        minutes. This item may be used to request a station stop. Set the duration in fast clock
        minutes using the spinner.</li>

        <li><strong>Set Maximum Speed</strong> - Set the maximum speed to a specified percentage of
        the maximum hardware speed.<br>
        When a Train is run in automatic mode, the program will never exceed this maximum speed.
        For example, this item may be used to force an automatic train to run slower through a
        town. Setting maximum speed does not affect the current speed of the Train if it is less
        than the specified maximum speed (percentage).<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatMaxSpeed.png" height="169" width="461" alt=
        "max speed action"></li>

        <li><strong>Set Train Speed</strong> - Set the current train speed to the target
        percentage. The throttle will send the new speed to the locomotive after the delay set
        under When.<br>
        How long it takes the Train to reach the new speed after that depends upon the locomotive
        decoder. The new speed may be either lower or higher than the previous value, but will not
        be allowed to exceed the maximum speed.</li>

        <li><strong>Ramp Train Speed</strong> - Set the current train speed to the target
        percentage by ramping to the target value using the default ramp rate of the automatically
        running Train. If the default ramp rate of the Train is RAMP_NONE, this action is
        equivalent to <strong>Set Train Speed</strong>. The new speed may be either lower or higher
        than the previous value, but will not be allowed to exceed the maximum speed.</li>

        <li><strong>Go to Manual Mode</strong> - Drop out of automatic mode to allow a human
        engineer to perform work with a manual throttle. This action supports the scenario where a
        Train might be run automatically to a work site, where a human operator takes over to
        perform work, after which automatic running is continued. The Train will remain in manual
        mode until directed by the dispatcher to resume automatic operation. An optional
        <strong>Done Sensor</strong> allows an operator remote from the dispatcher to notify the
        dispatcher that work has been completed and automatic running can be resumed. When the
        <strong>Done Sensor</strong> goes active, the status of the Train is changed from WORKING
        to READY. For more information on this action, see <strong><a href=
        "../dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></strong>. <strong>Note:</strong> When the
        Train is in manual mode, the computer does not have a throttle for the train available, so
        delayed actions that happen then and require a throttle are ignored.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatManual.png" height="169" width="460" alt=
        "manual mode action"></li>

        <li><strong>Set Locomotive Light</strong> - Sets the locomotive light either <em>On</em> or
        <em>Off</em> as selected.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatLight.png" height="167" width="461" alt=
        "set light action"></li>

        <li><strong>Start Bell</strong> - Start bell ringing on a sound decoder. This item will
        turn throttle function 1 on.</li>

        <li><strong>Stop Bell</strong> - Stop bell ringing on a sound decoder. This item will turn
        throttle function 1 off.</li>

        <li><strong>Sound Horn</strong> - Sound the horn (whistle) of a sound decoder for a
        specified time. This item is equivalent to holding down throttle function 2 for the
        specified time.</li>

        <li><strong>Pattern Sound Horn</strong> - Sound the horn (whistle) in a manner specified by
        a user-entered pattern. The pattern consists of short and long blasts, specified as "s" and
        "l" in the pattern. For example, a pattern of "lsl" specifies long-short-long. Sets the
        duration of the short and long blasts using the two spinners (milliseconds). The short
        blast duration is also used as the wait time between blasts. Actual times realized will
        depend on the sound decoder and how busy the computer is. The horn/whistle is assumed to be
        throttle function 2.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatPattern.png" height="171" width="460" alt=
        "horn pattern action"></li>

        <li><strong>Set Decoder Function</strong> - Sets the specified decoder function either
        <em>On</em> or <em>Off</em> as selected. This works for both sound decoders and decoders
        without sound.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatFunction.png" height="129" width="460" alt=
        "function action"></li>

        <li><strong>Set Sensor ACTIVE</strong> - Set a specified Sensor active. Select a Sensor
        from the drop down (Sensor Table). If the specified Sensor is already in the Active state,
        it is first toggled to the Inactive state, then set Active. This action may be used, for
        example, with an internal Sensor to trigger a Logix, set a Route, or set a Light. It offers
        access to a wide variety of actions not included here, such as running scripts or playing
        sounds.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatSensor.png" height="132" width="459" alt="sensor action"></li>

        <li><strong>Set Sensor INACTIVE</strong> - Set a specified Sensor inactive. Select a Sensor
        from the drop down (Sensor Table). If the specified Sensor is already in the inactive
        state, it is first toggled to the active state, then set inactive. This is equivalent to
        the action above, except with a different target Sensor state.</li>

        <li><strong>Hold Signal</strong> - Set a specified Signal Mast or Signal Head to HELD.
        Select either a Signal Mast or Head from one of the drop downs.<br>
        <img src="images/AddEditWhatHold.png" height="151" width="424" alt=
        "signal hold action"></li>

        <li><strong>Release Signal</strong> - Set a specified Signal Mast or Signal Head to NOT
        HELD. Select either a Signal Mast or Head from one of the drop downs.</li>
      </ul>
