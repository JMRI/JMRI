<h1>Actions</h1>
    
<h2>What are Actions?</h2>
<p><b>Actions</b> are tasks that can be initiated automatically as a train, running in 
automatic mode, traverses the layout following a 
<b><a href="TransitTable.shtml">Transit</a></b>. One or more <b>Actions</b> may 
be requested for each <b><a href="SectionTable.shtml">Section</a></b> in a Transit. 
If a Section is in a Transit multiple times, different 
<b>Actions</b> may be specified for each occurrence of the 
Section. <b>Actions</b> only apply to trains run automatically under
<b><a href="../dispatcher/DispatcherFrame.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b>
by a <i>virtual engineer</i>.  If running trains in automatic mode is of interest 
read on. If your trains will only be run manually with a human engineer, 
<b>Actions</b> aren't used.</p>

<p><b>Actions</b> are in addition to the <i>standard actions</i> that 
happen automatically when a train runs in automatic mode. Standard actions 
are things like following signals and using stop sensors, that are specified with 
each Section. <i>Standard actions</i> occur automatically whenever a Section is 
traversed in automatic mode. Other <i>standard actions</i> include automatically 
requesting allocation of Sections, and automatically changing locomotive speed 
according to signal restrictions.</p>

<p><b>Actions</b> are tied to Sections, but are specified at the Transit level 
to provide maximum user flexibility. A Section is a piece of physical track, 
that may, for example, be used by passenger trains, through freight trains, or 
locals. Each of these uses may need different <b>Actions</b> in a specific 
Section. For example, a passenger train may make a station stop in a particular 
Section, whereas a through freight train may go straight through. Placing 
<b>Actions</b> in Transits allows Active Trains traveling the same path 
through the layout to have different <b>Actions</b>.</p>

<h2>Requesting an Action</h2>

<p>An Action is requested by specifying <i>what</i> action to be 
performed and <i>when</i> that action is to be performed. Any <i>when</i> event 
may be combined with any <i>what</i> action, providing a wide variety of Special 
Actions. An Action is initiated when the train enters the Section with the Action 
request. To decide when to perform the Action after the Section is entered, the 
program looks at the <i>when</i> event. Currently available <i>when</i> events are:</p>

<p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>On Section Entry</b> - When the automatic train enters the current 
	Section.
	<li><b>On Section Exit</b> - When the automatic train exits the current 
	Section. This means when the last detectable car leaves the Section, and the 
	Section is unoccupied.
	<li><b>On Block Entry</b> - When the automatic train enters a 
	specified Block in the Section. For Sections with only one Block, this is 
	equivalent to <b>On Section Entry</b>.</li>
	<li><b>On Block Exit</b> - When the automatic train exits a 
	specified Block in the Section. This means when the last detectable car leaves 
	the specified Block, and the Block is unoccupied. For Sections with only one 
	Block, this is equivalent to <b>On Section Exit</b>.</li>
	<li><b>On Train Stop</b> - When the automatic train stops. This may be 
	used, for example, for stopping the bell in a sound decoder or initiating other 
	actions when the train stops at a station.</li>
	<li><b>On Train Start</b> - When the automatic trains starts up after having 
	been stopped. This may be used, for example, to initiate actions when a train 
	starts up after a station stop.</li>
	<li><b>On Sensor ACTiVE</b> - When the specified Sensor moves to the 
	active state. The specified Sensor may be either internal or hardware, and must 
	be in the Sensor Table. This might be used, for example, with a hardware Sensor 
	connected to a fascia push button to trigger an action. It could also be used to 
	trigger actions using hardware position sensors on the layout. With internal 
	sensors it can provide a link to Logix.</li>
	<li><b>On Sensor INACTIVE</b> - When the specified Sensor moves to the 
	inactive state. This is the same as above, but with the opposite sensor state. 
	Use the one that best fits your hardware or Logix.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>An optional delay, specified in milliseconds, is available for each <i>when</i> 
event. No delay is the default.  If an optional delay time is not entered (or a 
delay time of zero is entered), the action will be performed immediately after 
the <i>when</i> event occurs. If a delay time is specified, the program will wait 
for the specified time after the <i>when</i> event occurs before performing the 
action.</p>
<p>Currently available <i>what</i> actions are:
<p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Pause Train</b> - Stop the train for a specified number of fast clock minutes. 
	This item may be used to request a station stop.</li>
	<li><b>Set Maximum Speed</b> - Set the maximum speed to a specified percentage 
	of the maximum hardware speed. When a train is run in automatic mode, the 
	program will never exceed the maximum speed. For example, this item may be used 
	to force an automatic train to run slower through a town. Setting maximum speed 
	does not affect the current speed of the train if it is less than the specified 
	maximum speed.</li>
	<li><b>Set Train Speed</b> - Set the current train speed to the target percentage. 
	The throttle will send the new speed to the locomotive immediately. How long it takes 
	the train to reach the new speed after that depends upon the locomotive decoder. 
	The new speed may be either lower or higher than the previous value, but will not be 
	allowed to exceed the maximum speed.</li>
	<li><b>Ramp Train Speed</b> - Set the current train speed to the target percentage  
	by ramping to the target value using the default ramp rate of the automatically 
	running train. If the default ramp rate of the train is RAMP_NONE, this action is 
	equivalent to <b>Set Train Speed</b>. The new speed may be either lower or higher 
	than the previous value, but will not be allowed to exceed the maximum speed.</li>
	<li><b>Go to Manual Mode</b> - Drop out of automatic mode to allow a human 
	engineer to perform work with a manual throttle. This action supports the scenario 
	where a train might be run automatically to a work site, where a human operator 
	takes over to perform work, after which automatic running is continued. The train 
	will remain in manual mode until directed by the dispatcher to resume automatic 
	operation. An optional <b>Done Sensor</b> allows an operator remote from the 
	dispatcher to notify the dispatcher that work has been completed and automatic 
	running can be resumed. When the <b>Done Sensor</b> goes active, the status of 
	the train is changed from WORKING to READY. For more information on this action, 
	see <b><a href="../dispatcher/DispatcherFrame.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b>. <b>Note:</b> 
	When the train is in manual mode, the computer does not have a throttle for the 
	train available, so delayed actions that happen then and require a throttle are 
	ignored.</li>
	<li><b>Set Locomotive Light</b> - Sets the locomotive light either <i>On</i> or 
	<i>Off</i> as selected.</li>
	<li><b>Start Bell</b> - Start bell ringing on a sound decoder. This 
	item will turn throttle function 1 on.</li>
	<li><b>Stop Bell</b> - Stop bell ringing on a sound decoder. This 
	item will turn throttle function 1 off.</li>
	<li><b>Sound Horn</b> - Sound the horn (whistle) of a sound decoder for a specified 
	time. This item is equivalent to holding down throttle function 2 for the 
	specified time.</li>
	<li><b>Pattern Sound Horn</b> - Sound the horn (whistle) in a manner specified by 
	a user-entered pattern. The pattern consists of short and long blasts, specified as 
	"s" and "l" in the pattern. For example a pattern of "lsl" specifies long-short-long. 
	The user sets the duration of the short and long blasts. The short blast 
	duration is used as the wait time between blasts. Actual times realized will 
	depend on the sound decoder and how busy the computer is. The horn/whistle is 
	assumed to be throttle function 2.</li>
	<li><b>Set Decoder Function</b> - Sets the specified decoder function either 
	<i>On</i> or <i>Off</i> as selected. This works for both sound decoders and 
	decoders without sound.</li>
	<li><b>Set Sensor ACTIVE</b> - Set a specified Sensor active. The specified 
	Sensor must be in the Sensor Table. If the specified Sensor is already in the 
	active state, it is first toggled to the inactive state, then set active. This 
	action may be used, for example, with an internal sensor to trigger a Logix, set  
	a Route, or to set a Light. It offers access to a wide variety of actions not 
	included here, such as running scripts or playing sounds.</li>
	<li><b>Set Sensor INACTIVE</b> - Set a specified Sensor inactive. The specified 
	Sensor must be in the Sensor Table. If the specified Sensor is already in the 
	inactive state, it is first toggled to the active state, then set inactive. This 
	is equivalent to the action above, except with a different target Sensor state.</li>
	</ul>
