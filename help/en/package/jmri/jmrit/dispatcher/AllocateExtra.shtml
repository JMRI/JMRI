      <h1>JMRI Dispatcher: Allocate Extra</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The <strong>Allocate Extra Section</strong> pane allows "Extra Sections"
      to be allocated to any Dispatcher Active Train.
      "Extra Sections" are
      <a href="../beantable/SectionTable.shtml">Sections</a>
      that are not in the sequence of Sections defined in
      the Transit being followed by the Active Train. The need to
      allocate "extra Sections" can arise if the engineer of an
      Active Train needs to do more than simply run around the
      layout. For example, extra Sections could be needed for
      setting out or picking up cars, especially if a run around is
      needed.</p>

      <p>Extra Sections are allocated manually via the Dispatcher
      panel, using this window to select the Active Train and the
      Section to be allocated. Once allocated, extra Sections will
      show in the <strong>Allocated Sections</strong> table in the
      <strong><a href="Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></strong> window.
      <br>The
      <strong>Release</strong> button in the Allocated Section Table should
      be used to release the extra Sections when they are no longer
      required. The <strong>Auto Release</strong> option does not release
      extra Sections; extra Sections must be released manually.</p>

      <p>Note: Turnout checking and turnout setting are turned off
      during Allocate Extra. Turnouts should be set as needed by
      the dispatcher or by the engineer.</p>

      <h2>Using the Allocate Extra Window</h2>

      <p>To allocate and extra Section to an Active Train, use the
      following procedure:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click the <strong>Allocate Extra...</strong> button in the
          <strong><a href="Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></strong> window.
          This brings up the window shown below.</p><img src=
          "images/AllocateExtraWindow.png" width="433" height="135" alt="Allocate extra section">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select an Active Train in the <strong>Active Train:</strong>
          selection box. When an Active Train is selected, the
          <strong>Section to Allocate:</strong> selection box will change to
          display Sections that are appropriate to that Active
          Train. Active Train names are displayed in either short
          form (shown above) or long form depending on the option
          set in <strong><a href="Options.shtml">Dispatcher
          Options</a></strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a Section to allocate in the <strong>Section to
          Allocate:</strong> selection box. To be listed in this select
          box, a Section must be FREE (not allocated to any Active
          Train), and must be connected to a Section that is
          currently allocated to the Active Train selected in the
          <strong>Active Train:</strong> selection box.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Click the <strong>Allocate</strong> button to allocate the
          selected Section to the selected Active Train. The
          Section is allocated immediately, and this window
          disappears.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Or click the <strong>Cancel</strong> button to exit without
          allocating an extra Section.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Note: If this window accidentally should be left open,
      allocating a Section in another manner will automatically
      cancel the operation in this window, and this pane will
      disappear.</p>
