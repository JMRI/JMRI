<H1>Allocate Extra Window
</H1>
<H2>Introduction
</H2>
<p>The <b>Allocate Extra Window</b> allows "extra Sections" to be allocated to 
any Active Train. "Extra Sections" are Sections that are not in the sequence 
of Sections defined in the Transit being followed by the Active Train.  The need 
to allocate "extra Sections" can arise if the engineer of an Active Train needs 
to do more than simply run around the layout.  For example, extra Sections could 
be needed for setting out or picking up cars, especially if a run around is 
needed.</p>

<p> Extra Sections are allocated manually via the Dispatcher panel, using this 
window to select the Active Train and the Section to be allocated. Once allocated, 
extra Sections will show in the <b>Allocated Sections</b> table in the 
<b><a href="Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b> window.  The <b>Release</b> button 
in the Allocated Section Table should be used to release the extra Sections when 
they are no longer required. The <b>Auto Release</b> option does not release extra 
Sections; extra Sections must be released manually.</p>

<p>Note: Turnout checking and turnout setting are turned off during Allocate Extra.  
Turnouts should be set as needed by the dispatcher or by the engineer.</p>

<H2>Using the Allocate Extra Window
</H2>
<p>To allocate and extra Section to an Active Train, use the following 
procedure:
<ol>
<li><p>Click the <b>Allocate Extra...</b> button in the 
<b><a href="Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b> window. This brings up 
the window shown below.</p>
<img src="AllocateExtraWindow.jpg" height="146" width="267">
</li>
<li><p>Select an Active Train in the <b>Active Train:</b> select box. When an 
Active Train is selected, the <b>Section to Allocate:</b> select box will change 
to display Sections that are appropriate to that Active Train. Active Train 
names are displayed in either short form (shown above) or long form depending 
on the option selected in the Dispatcher's <b><a href="Options.shtml">Options</a></b>
window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select a Section to allocate in the <b>Section to Allocate:</b> select box.
To be listed in this select box, a Section must be FREE (not allocated to any 
Active Train), and must be connected to a Section that is currently allocated 
to the Active Train selected in the <b>Active Train:</b> select box.</p>
<li><p>Click the <b>Allocate</b> button to allocate the selected Section to the 
selected Active Train. The Section is allocated immediately, and this window
disappears.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Or click the <b>Cancel</b> button to exit without allocating an extra
Section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If this window accidentally should be left open, allocating a Section in 
another manner will automatically cancel the operation in this window, and this 
window will disappear.
