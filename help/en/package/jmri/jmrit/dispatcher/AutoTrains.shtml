<H1>The AutoTrains Window</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>The <b>AutoTrains</b> window allows the dispatcher to take control of an 
Auto Active Train (an automatically running Active Train) from the <i>virtual 
dispatcher</i> when required to solve a problem, and to restore automatic operation 
after the problem is solved. Example problems requiring the dispatcher to intervene 
are derailment of the train, or unexpected uncoupling of cars in a train. This 
window is also used to restart automatic operation after suspending it for a human 
engineer to switch train cars or perform other work.</p>
<p> When the first Auto Active Train is created in
<b><a href="Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b>, an <b>AutoTrains</b> window is 
opened immediately to the right of the Dispatcher window. This window may be moved 
to another location if desired. An entry is added for each additional Auto Active 
Train as it is created. When an Auto Active Train is terminated, its entry is 
removed from the <b>AutoTrains</b> window.

<H2>Using the AutoTrains Window</H2>
<p>Below is an <b>AutoTrains</b> window showing two Auto Active Trains, Amtrak 139 and 
GTW 6418. Entries are separated by a horizontal line.</p>
<img src="AutoTrainsA.jpg" height="154" width="255">
<p>Each entry has a <b>Stop</b> button and a <b>To Manual</b> button. If the 
dispatcher presses the <b>Stop</b> button, the Auto Active Train is immediately 
stopped. The stopping is an emergency stop--no gradual reduction of speed. Clicking 
the <b>Stop All Auto Trains</b> button at the bottom of the window will issue an 
emergency stop to all Auto Active Trains shown in the <b>AutoTrains</b> window. 
<b>Stop</b> buttons change to <b>Resume</b> buttons when trains are stopped. Each 
stopped train must be restarted individually by clicking its <b>Resume</b> button. 
</p>
<p>Once an AutoTrain has completed its run, the <b>Stop</b> button changes to 
<b>Restart</b>. Pressing this causes the AutoTrain to begin running again.</p>
<p>If the dispatcher clicks the <b>To Manual</b> button for Amtrak 139, the above 
window changes to:</p>
<img src="AutoTrainsB.jpg" height="154" width="551">
<p>The slider controls the train speed, and the <b>For</b> and <b>Rev</b> radio 
buttons control the train direction. The dispatcher can use these controls to run 
the train and fix whatever problem is present. When the problem is remedied, clicking 
the <b>To Auto</b> button will restore automatic operation of the train. Prior to 
clicking its <b>To Auto</b> button, the dispatcher should run the train to the 
same location where it was when <b>To Manual</b> was clicked. This assures smooth 
resumption of automatic operation.</p>
<p>One of the user-specified <b>Actions</b> is <b>Go to Manual Mode</b>. This 
Action supports running an Auto Active Train automatically to a work side, where a 
human engineer takes over to preform operations (perhaps switching cars), after 
which automatic running is continued following the same Transit. When the 
<b>Go to Manual Mode</b> action is initiated, the <b>Stop</b> and <b>ToManual</b> 
buttons are replaced by one <b>Resume Auto Running</b> button, and the computer 
throttle being used by the <i>virtual engineer</i> is released. A human engineer 
can then plug in a manual throttle and acquire the train for manual running.
After the human engineer has completed his/her work, the human engineer releases 
the manual throttle, and informs the dispatcher that automatic operation may be 
resumed. The dispatcher resumes automatic operation by clicking the 
<b>Resume Auto Running</b> button. Prior to releasing the manual throttle, the 
human engineer should run the train in the same position it was in when manual 
mode operation was initiated. This insures smooth resumption of automatic 
operation.</p>
