      <h1>JMRI Dispatcher: AutoTrains</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The <b>AutoTrains</b> pane allows the dispatcher to take
      control of an Auto Active Train (an automatically running
      Active Train) from the <i>virtual dispatcher</i> when
      required to solve a problem, and to restore automatic
      operation after the problem is solved. Example problems
      requiring the dispatcher to intervene are derailment of the
      train, or unexpected uncoupling of cars in a train. This
      window is also used to restart automatic operation after
      suspending it for a human engineer to switch train cars or
      perform other work.</p>

      <p>When the first Auto Active Train is created in <b><a href=
      "Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b>, an <b>AutoTrains</b>
      pane is opened immediately to the right of the Dispatcher
      window. The pane may be moved to another location if
      desired. An entry is added for each additional Auto Active
      Train as it is created. When an Auto Active Train is
      terminated, its entry is removed from the <b>AutoTrains</b>
      pane.</p>

      <h2>Using the AutoTrains Window</h2>

      <p>Below is an <b>AutoTrains</b> pane showing two Auto
      Active Trains, Amtrak 139 and GTW 6418. Entries are separated
      by a horizontal line.</p><img src="images/AutoTrainsA.png"
      width="337" height="177">

      <p>Each entry has a <b>Stop</b> button and a <b>To Manual</b>
      button. If the dispatcher presses the <b>Stop</b> button, the
      Auto Active Train is immediately stopped. The stopping is an
      emergency stop--no gradual reduction of speed. Clicking the
      <b>Stop All AutoTrains</b> button at the bottom of the
      pane will issue an emergency stop to all Auto Active Trains
      shown in the <b>AutoTrains</b> pane. <b>Stop</b> buttons
      change to <b>Resume</b> buttons when trains are stopped. Each
      stopped train must be restarted individually by clicking its
      <b>Resume</b> button.</p>

      <p>Once an AutoTrain has completed its run, the <b>Stop</b>
      button changes to <b>Restart</b>. Pressing this causes the
      AutoTrain to begin running again.</p>

      <p>If the dispatcher clicks the <b>To Manual</b> button for
      Amtrak 139, its line in the pane changes to:</p><img src=
      "images/AutoTrainsB.png" width="576" height="176">

      <p>The <b>Fw</b> (Forward) and <b>Rev</b> (Reverse) radio
      buttons control the train direction and the slider controls
      the train speed. The dispatcher can use these controls to
      run the train and fix whatever problem is present. When the
      problem is remedied, clicking the <b>To Auto</b> button will
      restore automatic operation of the train.<br>
      Note: Prior to clicking its <b>To Auto</b>
      button, the dispatcher should run the train to the same
      location where it was when <b>To Manual</b> was clicked. This
      assures smooth resumption of automatic operation.</p>

      <h3>AutoTrains - Go to Manual Mode Action</h3>

      <p>One of the user-selectable Transit
      <a href="../beantable/ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a>
      is <b>Go to Manual Mode</b>.<br>
      This Action supports running an Auto Active
      Train automatically to a work site, where a human engineer
      takes over to perform operations (perhaps switching cars),
      after which automatic running is continued following the same
      Transit. When the <b>Go to Manual Mode</b> action is
      initiated, the <b>Stop</b> and <b>To Manual</b> buttons are
      replaced by one <b>Resume Auto Running</b> button, and the
      computer throttle being used by the <i>virtual engineer</i>
      is released. A human engineer can then plug in a manual
      throttle and acquire the train for manual running. After the
      human engineer has completed his/her work, the human engineer
      releases the manual throttle, and informs the dispatcher that
      automatic operation may be resumed. The dispatcher resumes
      automatic operation by clicking the <b>Resume Auto
      Running</b> button. Prior to releasing the manual throttle,
      the human engineer should run the train to the same position
      it was in when manual mode operation was initiated. This
      ensures smooth resumption of automatic operation.</p>
