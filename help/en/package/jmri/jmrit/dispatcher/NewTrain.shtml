      <h1>JMRI Dispatcher: Activate New Train</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The <strong>Activate New Train</strong> window supports the creation of a new
      <strong>Active Train</strong>. To create an Active Train, the dispatcher uses this window to
      assign a <strong><a href="../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit</a></strong>, assign a
      train, and specify a starting Block (Train location at start) and an end Block (Train
      location when transit of the layout is complete). Options for the new <strong>Active
      Train</strong> are also set using this window.</p>

      <p>Transits are selected from the Transits defined in the Transit Table. Dispatcher will list
      all Transits that are not currently in Active Trains.</p>

      <p>Trains, that is the Lead locomotive, may come from any one of three sources:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trains from Roster</strong> - Dispatcher will list all trains in the JMRI
        Roster that are not currently in Active Trains. The default TrainName will the Roster Entry's
        Title and maybe edited by the User.</li>

        <li>
          <strong>Trains from Trains</strong> - Dispatcher will list all trains available from
          <a href="../operations/Operations.shtml#Trains">Operations</a> that are not already in
          any Dispatcher Active Trains. The TrainName and DCC address of the locomotive may be
          edited by the User.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Trains from User Entry</strong> - Dispatcher will replace the train selection
        box in the Activate New Train window with two entry fields allowing the user to enter a
        Train name and a loco Address.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A fourth option, <strong>Set Later</strong> is used when setting up and saving routing and
      control information that will be saved for later use.</p>

      <p>Dispatcher's train default source is set by selecting one of the above in the <strong><a href=
      "Options.shtml">Options</a></strong> window accessed from Dispatcher's
      <strong>Options</strong> menu.</p>

      <p>Active Trains must start from a Block in the selected Transit, or from a Block connected
      to a Block in the selected Transit. Active Trains must stop in a Block within the selected
      Transit. Transits have a direction, so for a starting Block outside the Transit to be a valid
      starting Block, entry to the Transit from the starting Block must result in travel in the
      Transit's defined direction. This window only allows selection of valid starting and stopping
      Blocks. Initially the first occupied block is selected for you in the combo box.<br>
      Note: If an expected Block is not in the starting Block selection box, it may be because of
      this requirement.</p>

      <h2 id="loadsave">Saving and Retrieving Active Train Information</h2>
      <span class="since">since 2.5.2</span>
      <p>To facilitate easy set up of Active Trains that are used more than once, Dispatcher
      provides for saving and loading train information from disk.</p>

      <p>To save your train information to disk, click the <strong>Save Train Info&hellip;</strong>
      button after all selections and options have been set up but <em>before</em> clicking the
      <strong>Create</strong> button. This will bring up a small window allowing you to name the
      saved train information file. The name you enter will be normalized automatically with any
      non-alphanumeric characters replaced, and a .xml suffix added if needed. Train information
      files are saved as .xml files in the <strong>dispatcher/traininfo</strong> folder in the user's
      preferences area on disk.</p>

      <p>To load previously saved train information, click the <strong>Load Train Info&hellip;</strong>
      button immediately after the Activate New Train window is displayed. This will bring up a
      small window allowing you to select the train information file to load from all the train
      information files in the dispatcher folder. When a train information file is loaded all items
      in the Activate New Train window are set according to the saved train information if
      possible. If an item cannot be set, for example if the specified Transit is in use, a warning
      is displayed and a default selection is made. After loading, you may change any option or
      selection and again save your new train information, before clicking the
      <strong>Create</strong> button.</p>

      <p>Use <strong>Save As Defaults</strong> to have the form load as it is set now when creating a new train.</p>

      <p class="noted">If the transit assigned to a train info file is changed, such as adding or
      removing sections, the train info file will need to be updated.  This can done by loading and
      then saving the affected train info file.</p>

      <p>To permanently remove an unneeded Train Info file from the <strong>dispatcher</strong>
      folder in your user preferences area, click the <strong>Delete&hellip;</strong> button, then
      select the train information file to be deleted.</p>

      <h2>Using the Activate New Train Window</h2>

      <p>To create a new <strong>Active Train</strong>, use the following procedure:</p>

      <p>A train name in the <strong>Train:</strong> field. Any short name that identifies the train may
      be used, provided the name is not being used by another Active Train.</p>

      <p>The <strong>DCC Address</strong> must be a number in the range 1 - 9999.<br>
      Note: If the train will not be run automatically, the dcc address need not be accurate.
      This window is displayed if <strong>Trains from User Entry</strong> is selected as
      Dispatcher's train source.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click the <strong>New Train&hellip;</strong> button in the <strong><a href=
          "Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></strong> window, or the <strong>Create New Train</strong> menu item
          from the dispatcher menu in a Layout Editor Panel, to bring up the window shown below.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you are not using the default Trains From source, select the desired source.</p>
          <p>For <strong>Roster</strong>, shown above, you need to select the Roster Entry, which
          will become the default Train Name that can then be edited.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Select a Transit from the Transit selection box. The selected Transit specifies
                  the route the Active Train will follow while running on the layout. Transits are
                  displayed and new Transits are created using the <strong><a href=
                  "../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit Table</a></strong> accessed from the
                  <strong>Tables</strong> submenu of the JMRI <strong>Tools</strong> menu. This
                  Transit selection box will allow selection of any Transit in the Transit Table
                  that is not in use by an Active Train.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>If the starting location of the Active Train is a Block within the selected
                  Transit, check the <strong>Train in selected Transit</strong> box. If the starting
                  location of the Active Train is outside the selected Transit, (in a Block connected
                  to a Block within the selected Transit) uncheck this box. Checking and unchecking
                  this box results in different selections in the <strong>Starting Location of
                  Train:</strong> select box.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Select a <strong>Starting Location of Train:</strong> from the select box. This
                  select box lists all Blocks consistent with the check box above and the selected
                  Transit. To identify each Block uniquely, the Block identifier consists of the
                  Block display name followed by the sequence number of a Section in the Transit
                  definition. If the train is located in the Transit, this sequence number identifies
                  the Section where the train is located. If the train is located in a connected
                  Block, the sequence number identifies the Section that will be entered when the
                  train enters the Transit. If the train spans two blocks, select the Block where
                  the engine is located.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Select a <strong>Destination Location of Train:</strong> from the select box.
                  This select box lists all Blocks consistent with the selected Transit that can be
                  reached from the selected starting location by travel in the direction of the
                  Transit. The Block identifier in the select box consists of the Block display name.
                  If a Section is in the Transit more than once, the sequence number of the destination
                  Section is appended to the Block identifier to identify the destination Block uniquely.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>An <strong>Ad Hoc</strong> transit is created dynamically between 2 blocks. These
              are always run using "No Signals". Ad hoc transits are removed at train termination.
              If they are not removed for any reason they will not be stored. Currently the route
              must be clear from end to end and any flaws in the routing table will cause grief.
              Avoid having the train stop in them.</p>

        <li id="allocateOptions">
          <p>As a train proceeds along the transit route, transit sections need to be allocated.
          Note:  This only applies when the <strong>Auto Allocate</strong> option has been enabled.
          <span class="since">since 4.9.5</span></p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>As Far As Pos</strong> (Allocate As Far As Possible) - Select to allow
            Dispatcher, when using Auto Allocation, to allocate as far ahead of the Train as
            allowed by other circumstances such as an occupied Block. Allocation is of course also
            limited by the <strong>Destination Location of Train</strong> selection.</li>

            <li>
              <strong>To Safe Secs</strong> (Allocate to Safe Sections) - Choose this option if you
              have different trains going through a single Block in both directions.<br>
              Define Transits and mark as Safe the Sections that form passing places for opposing
              traffic. If there are Alternative Sections in the Transit, mark those as Safe as
              well.<br>
              Note: If you notice that, upon assignment, Turnouts are being set that were already
              set, you need to select "Trust Known State of Turnouts" in the <a href=
              "Options.shtml">Dispatcher Options</a>.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Number of Sections</strong> - When using Auto Allocation, Dispatcher will
            allocate ahead of the current location of the Train no more than the entered number of
            Sections set in the Spinner.<br>
            Because a value of 1 in the current version is known to cause unexpected results, be
            advised to set it to 2 or higher.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <strong>Reset when Done</strong> to set up the Active Train for continuous
          running. When checked, the train will restart based on the "Add Delay" value. When an
          Active Train has completed running through its Transit, it is immediately reset to run
          around its Transit again. Continuous running requires that the selected Transit be set up
          in a certain way--the first Section and the last Section must be the same. If the
          selected Transit is not capable of continuous running, the user is warned and
          <strong>Reset when Done</strong> remains unchecked.<br>
          For more information on setting up a Transit for continuous running see the

        <li>
          <p>Check <strong>Reverse at End</strong> to set up the Active Train for back and forth
          running. With <strong>Reverse at End</strong> selected, when an Active Train is has
          reached the end of its Transit, the Transit direction is reversed, and the Train backs up
          through the Transit to its starting point. For back and forth running, the Transit should
          have at least three Sections, one at each end and at least one in the middle, and the
          Active Train should fit into each of the end Sections. Continuous back and forth running
          is accomplished by also checking <strong>Reset when Done</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Enter a <strong>Priority</strong> for the Active Train relative to other Active Trains.
        Larger numbers are higher priority. The priority is used by the dispatcher and/or automated
        dispatching functions to arbitrate between Active Trains if multiple Active Trains are
        requesting the same resources.</li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <strong>Train Type</strong> from the <strong>Train Type:</strong> popup menu.
          The selected train type is displayed in the Dispatcher window to aid in allocation
          decisions.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the train is to start at a specified Fast Clock time, check the <strong>Delayed
          Start</strong> box, and enter the desired start time in the hour and minute fields of the
          <strong>Departure Time:</strong> entry. If the fast clock has not reached the specified
          Departure Time of an Active Train, the scheduled departure time is displayed in that
          Active Train's entry of the Active Train table in the Dispatcher window. If an Active
          Train is waiting for the fast clock, Dispatcher will refuse to allocate Sections to it,
          however, the dispatcher is given a chance to override this restriction. If an Active
          Train is being run automatically by the computer (see below), the Active Train will
          automatically start at the specified fast clock time. This option allows the dispatcher
          to set up a number of Active Trains which will start at various times during a
          session.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Check <strong>Load this Train at Startup</strong> to have Dispatcher automatically load
        this Train when Dispatcher starts. You must <strong>Save Train Info&hellip;</strong> for this
        flag to take effect on the next start.</li>

        <li id="new_auto_train">
          <p>Check <strong>Run Train Automatically</strong> to request that the Active Train be run
          automatically by the computer. If the Active Train is to be run manually by a human
          engineer, skip the next few steps; go directly to the third to last item of these
          instructions. Requesting <strong>Run Train Automatically</strong> will extend this window

          <p><span class="since">since 5.15.4</span>An advanced feature has been added to Dispatcher
          which uses physical characteristics of a locomotive to provide more realistic acceleration

          throttle setting applied will be at least this.  When stopping the train using Ramping or
          a Speed Profile the last step before Zero will at least this value.  Use this to deal with
          locos that have settings below this value that though they may work they do not work reliably.</p>

          <p>This must be at least 10 less than the Maximum Throttle setting. The default is zero.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="ramp_rate">
          <p>Select a <strong>Ramp Rate</strong>. When a train running automatically needs to
          change speed, the computer can send the new speed to the locomotive immediately
          (RAMP_NONE), or it can <strong>Ramp</strong> the speed to its new value (change the speed
          gradually) bringing the train to the new speed over a period of time. The Ramp Rate to
          use depends upon the decoder in the locomotive and how the decoder is set up. Some
          decoders have features that can change speed gradually (this decoder option is named
          differently for different decoders). If the decoder is doing the desired job, select
          RAMP_NONE. If the loco is speed profiled then you may select <strong>Speed Profile</strong>
          which will cause speed changes to take place over the length of the section or block.
          Otherwise select one of the ramp rates offered.

          <p><span class="since">since 5.15.4</span>The <strong>Physics</strong> option has been
          added to the ramp rate dropdown.  When Physics is selected, the line in the blue box is
          made visible.</p>

          <p>If a locomotive has a Speed Profile <em>and</em> its locomotive data parameters have
          been set in its roster entry, then you can select <strong>Physics</strong> in the ramp
          rate dropdown. With this mode enabled, acceleration will be calculated automatically based
          on the train's physical properties (e.g. power and weight).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Use Speed Profile</strong> - If a locomotive has a <a href=
          "../roster/swing/speedprofile/SpeedProfileFrame.shtml">Speed Profile</a>, the speed will
          be set using the Warrant Preferences settings and the speed profile. So if the speed
          calls for "restricted", it looks that up in the Warrant Preferences, gets the required
          speed &amp; units and uses the Profile to set the Throttle percentage.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Stop By Speed Profile</strong> The loco will begin to stop when it enters the
          Section and -if the profile is accurate and the block lengths are accurate- stop at the
          far end.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Adjust</strong> Set the percentage of the final Block length to be used for
          stopping when stopping By Speed Profiles is set. Small values in small Blocks tend to
          cause the loco to just stop.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><span class="since">since 5.15.4</span>Set the <strong>Override stop sensors</strong>
          option active to ignore section stop sensors and stop by using dead reckoning.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><span class="since">since 5.15.4</span>The <strong>Stop by distance into destination
          section</strong> option is used to control how far into the final transit section a train
          should proceed before stopping.
          This will override the <strong>Adjust</strong> parameter if it is set. If <strong>Head</strong>
          is select the front of the train will stop this far into the section. If <strong>Tail</strong>
          is selected, the rear of the train will stop this far into the section. The tail is based
          on the maximum train length (see below) and will not work unless this has been set. If
          there are stop sensors in the section, the train will decelerate to minimum speed within
          the specified distance but stop whenever it reaches the stop sensor, whether this is before
          or after the distance given unless <strong>Override stop sensors</strong> has been selected,
          in which case the stop sensors will be ignored.</p>

          <p><span class="since">since 5.15.4</span>
          If <strong>Physics</strong> based ramping has been selected the options in the blue box
          are made visible.</p>

          <p>The options are used to specify the additional train weight, driver power applied % and
          rolling resistance of the train. Use the additional train weight to set any weight of the
          train over and above the weight set in the roster entry. For example, if the roster Entry
          defines a locomotive, use the additional train weight to specify the weight of the whole
          train including cargo/passengers.  If the weight in the roster entry is for a multiple
          unit, use the additional weight to define the weight of any passengers.  The "driver power
          applied" % sets how much power (in proportion to the maximum power available) that the
          driver applies when accelerating the train to simulate the fact that drivers do not always
          drive their trains as hard as possible.  The <strong>Rolling resistence</strong> option is
          an advanced value that affects acceleration.  Changing the default value requires a good
          understanding of the physics involved.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <strong>Loco has sound decoder.</strong> if the locomotive has a sound decoder.
          If this item is not checked, <strong>Actions</strong> that require a sound decoder, such
          as ringing the bell or sounding the horn will be skipped.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <strong>Run in reverse</strong> if the locomotive is to be run in reverse
          through the Transit. This should not be confused with the direction through the Transit,
          which is always FORWARD when the Active Train starts up. Checking this item is equivalent
          to using the reverse setting on a manual throttle.</p>

          <p>This option allows a locomotive to back up through the Transit. For example, a local
          moves out of a yard automatically in the forward direction to a siding, cars are switched
          manually, then the locomotive needs to back up automatically to the yard. This could be
          accomplished using two Active Trains, both running automatically. One would move the
          train from the yard to the siding with the locomotive moving forward, and the second one,
          using a different, but similar Transit would back from the siding to the yard, with the
          Active Train in reverse. This should also cover the situation where <em>forward</em> and
          <em>reverse</em> are backwards in the locomotive.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="trainlength">
          <p>Enter the <strong>Maximum Train Length</strong> for the train while traversing the
          Transit. The length can be entered in actual (measured with a ruler on the layout), inches
          or centimeters, or, scale (measured in real life), feet or meters.  It is important to
          enter a reasonable value for the maximum length as it is used during stopping
          and releasing sections.</p>

          <p>The default scale units are set in <strong><a href="Options.shtml">Dispatcher Options</a></strong>
          accessed from Dispatcher's <strong>Options</strong> menu. The converted value is calculated
          and displayed to the right. The value does not need to be updated if the layout scale or
          the base layout measurements are changed to or from metric.</p>

          <p>When a train needs to stop, the train length, the section length and the detection option
          are used if the section does not have a stopping sensor and <strong>Stop by Speed Profile</strong>
          is not enabled.</p>

          <p>If the <strong>Entire Train</strong> detection option is selected and the train will fit
          in the section, the train will stop when the previous section becomes UNOCCUPIED, otherwise
          the train will stop on entry to the section.  Note: This uses <em>debounce timings</em>,
          which -if large- can result in the train over running the block if it only just fits.</p>
