<H1>Activate New Train Window</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

The <b>Activate New Train</b> window supports the creation of a new <b>Active 
Train</b>. To create an Active Train, the dispatcher uses this window to assign
a <b><a href="../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit</a></b>, assign a train, 
and specify a starting Block (train location at start) and an end Block (train 
location when transit of the layout is complete). Options for the new <b>Active 
Train</b> are also set using this window. It is likely that more Active Train 
options will be added in the future.</p>
<p>Transits are always selected from Transits defined in the Transit Table. 
Trains may come from any one of three sources:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Trains from Roster</b> - Dispatcher will list all trains in the JMRI 
	Roster that are not currently in Active Trains.</li>
	<li><b>Trains from Trains</b> - Dispatcher will list all trains available 
	from Operations that are not in Active Trains.</li>
	<li><b>Trains from User Entry</b> - Dispatcher will replace the train 
	selection box in the Activate New Train window with two entry fields 
	allowing the user to enter a train name and a dcc Address.
	</li></ul>
<p>Dispatcher's train source is set by selecting one of the above in the 
<b><a href="Options.shtml">Options</a></b> window accessed from Dispatcher's 
<b>Options</b> menu.</p>
<p>Active Trains must start from a Block in the selected Transit, or from a 
Block connected to a Block in the selected Transit. Active Trains must stop 
in a Block within the selected Transit. Transits have a direction, so for 
a starting Block outside the Transit to be a valid starting Block, entry to 
the Transit from the starting Block must result in travel in the Transit's 
defined direction. This window only allows selection of valid starting and 
stopping Blocks. If an expected Block is not in the starting Block selection 
box, it may be because of this requirement.</p>

<H2>Using the Activate New Train Window</H2>

To create a new <b>Active Train</b>, use the following procedure:
<ol>
<li><p>Click the <b>New Train...</b> button in the 
<b><a href="Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b> window to bring up 
the window shown below.</p>
<img src="NewTrainWindow.jpg" height="258" width="375">
</li>
<li><p>Select a Transit from the Transit selection box. The selected 
Transit specifies the route the Active Train will follow while  
running on the layout. Transits are displayed and new Transits are created 
using the <b><a href="../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit Table</a></b> 
accessed from the <b>Tables</b> submenu of the JMRI <b>Tools</b> menu. This 
Transit selection box will allow selection of any Transit in the Transit Table 
that is not in use by an Active Train.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the window shown above is displayed, select a train from the Train 
selection box. This window is displayed if the <b>Trains from Roster</b> or 
the <b>Trains from Trains</b> options are selected as Dispatcher's train 
source.</p>
<p>- OR -</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the window shown below is displayed,</p> 
<img src="NewTrainAltWindow.jpg" height="277" width="368">
<p>enter a train name in the <b>Train Name:</b> field, and enter a numeric 
address in the <b>DCC Address:</b> field. Any short name that identifies 
the train may be used provided the name is not being used by another Active 
Train. Dcc addresses must be a number in the range 1 - 9999. Note: If the 
train will not be run automatically, the dcc address need not be accurate. This 
window is displayed if <b>Trains from User Entry</b> is selected as Dispatcher's 
train source.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the starting location of the Active Train is a Block within the 
selected Transit, check the <b>Train in selected Transit</b> box. If the 
starting location of the Active Train is outside the selected Transit, (in 
a Block connected to a Block within the selected Transit) uncheck this box. 
Checking and unchecking this box results in different selections in the 
<b>Starting Location of Train:</b> select box.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select a <b>Starting Location of Train:</b> from the select box. This 
select box lists all Blocks consistent with the check box above and the 
selected Transit. To identify each Block uniquely, the Block identifier 
consists of the Block system name, followed by the Block user name (in 
parentheses) followed by the sequence number of a Section in the 
Transit definition. If the train is located in the Transit, this 
sequence number identifies the Section where the train is located. If the 
train is located in a connected Block, the sequence number identifies the 
Section that will be entered when the train enters the Transit. If the train 
spans two blocks, select the Block where the engine is located.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select a <b>Destination Location of Train:</b> from the select box. This 
select box lists all Blocks consistent with the selected Transit that can be 
reached from the selected starting location by travel in the direction of 
the Transit. The Block identifier in the select box consists of the Block system 
name, followed by the Block user name (in parentheses). If a Section is in the 
Transit more than once, the sequence number of the destination Section is 
appended to the Block identifier to identify the destination 
Block uniquely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter a <b>Priority</b> for the Active Train relative to other Active 
Trains. Larger numbers are higher priority. The priority is used in by 
automated dispatching functions to arbitrate between Active Trains if multiple 
Active Trains are requesting the same resources.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check <b>Run Train Automatically</b> to request that the Active Train 
be run automatically by the computer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <b>Add New Train</b> after all the above have been set to create 
and activate the new Active Train. The new Active Train will immediately 
appear in the Dispatcher window, and this window will be dismissed.</p>
<p>- OR -</p>
</li>
</li>
<li><p>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit this window without creating a new Active 
Train.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note: Automated dispatching and automatic running of trains are not 
implemented in the initial version of Dispatcher.</b> These functions are 
expected to be introduced in later versions of JMRI.</p>
