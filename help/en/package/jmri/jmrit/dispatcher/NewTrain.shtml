      <h1>JMRI Dispatcher: Activate New Train</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The <strong>Activate New Train</strong> window supports the creation of a new
      <strong>Active Train</strong>. To create an Active Train, the dispatcher uses this window to
      assign a <strong><a href="../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit</a></strong>, assign a
      train, and specify a starting Block (Train location at start) and an end Block (Train
      location when transit of the layout is complete). Options for the new <strong>Active
      Train</strong> are also set using this window.</p>

      <p>Transits are selected from the Transits defined in the Transit Table. Dispatcher will list
      all Transits that are not currently in Active Trains.</p>

      <p>Trains may come from any one of three sources:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trains from Roster</strong> - Dispatcher will list all trains in the JMRI
        Roster that are not currently in Active Trains.</li>

        <li>
          <strong>Trains from Trains</strong> - Dispatcher will list all trains available from
          <a href="../operations/Operations.shtml#Trains">Operations</a> that are not already in
          any Dispatcher Active Trains.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Trains from User Entry</strong> - Dispatcher will replace the train selection
        box in the Activate New Train window with two entry fields allowing the user to enter a
        Train name and a loco Address.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Dispatcher's train source is set by selecting one of the above in the <strong><a href=
      "Options.shtml">Options</a></strong> window accessed from Dispatcher's
      <strong>Options</strong> menu.</p>

      <p>Active Trains must start from a Block in the selected Transit, or from a Block connected
      to a Block in the selected Transit. Active Trains must stop in a Block within the selected
      Transit. Transits have a direction, so for a starting Block outside the Transit to be a valid
      starting Block, entry to the Transit from the starting Block must result in travel in the
      Transit's defined direction. This window only allows selection of valid starting and stopping
      Blocks. Initially the first occupied block is selected for you in the combo box.<br>
      Note: If an expected Block is not in the starting Block selection box, it may be because of
      this requirement.</p>

      <h2 id="loadsave">Saving and Retrieving Active Train Information</h2>
      <span class="since">since 2.5.2</span>
      <p>To facilitate easy set up of Active Trains that are used more than once, Dispatcher
      provides for saving and loading train information from disk.</p>

      <p>To save your train information to disk, click the <strong>Save Train Info...</strong>
      button after all selections and options have been set up but <em>before</em> clicking the
      <strong>Create</strong> button. This will bring up a small window allowing you to name the
      saved train information file. The name you enter will be normalized automatically with any
      non-alphanumeric characters replaced, and a .xml suffix added if needed. Train information
      files are saved as .xml files in the <strong>dispatcher</strong> folder in the user's
      preferences area on disk.</p>

      <p>To load previously saved train information, click the <strong>Load Train Info...</strong>
      button immediately after the Activate New Train window is displayed. This will bring up a
      small window allowing you to select the train information file to load from all the train
      information files in the dispatcher folder. When a train information file is loaded all items
      in the Activate New Train window are set according to the saved train information if
      possible. If an item cannot be set, for example if the specified Transit is in use, a warning
      is displayed and a default selection is made. After loading, you may change any option or
      selection and again save your new train information, before clicking the
      <strong>Create</strong> button.</p>

      <p class="noted">If the transit assigned to a train info file is changed, such as adding or
      removing sections, the train info file will need to be updated.  This can done by loading and
      then saving the affected train info file.</p>

      <p>To permanently remove an unneeded Train Info file from the <strong>dispatcher</strong>
      folder in your user preferences area, click the <strong>Delete...</strong> button, then
      select the train information file to be deleted.</p>

      <h2>Using the Activate New Train Window</h2>

      <p>To create a new <strong>Active Train</strong>, use the following procedure:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click the <strong>New Train...</strong> button in the <strong><a href=
          "Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></strong> window to bring up the window shown below.</p>
          <img src="images/NewTrainWindow.png" height="573" width="489" alt="new train window">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you want to use saved Train information, click <strong>Load Train Info...</strong>
          See <a href="#loadsave">above</a> for more on loading Train information.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a Transit from the Transit selection box. The selected Transit specifies the
          route the Active Train will follow while running on the layout. Transits are displayed
          and new Transits are created using the <strong><a href=
          "../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit Table</a></strong> accessed from the
          <strong>Tables</strong> submenu of the JMRI <strong>Tools</strong> menu. This Transit
          selection box will allow selection of any Transit in the Transit Table that is not in use
          by an Active Train.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the window shown above is displayed, select a train from the Train selection box.
          This window is displayed if the <strong>Trains from Roster</strong> or the <strong>Trains
          from Trains</strong> options are selected as Dispatcher's train source.</p>

          <p>- OR -</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If <a href="Options.shtml">Dispatcher Options</a> is set to <strong>Trains from User
          Entry</strong>, the following pane is displayed.<br>
          Enter a train name in the <strong>Train:</strong> field, and set a numeric address from 1
          to 9999 as the <strong>DCC Address</strong>.</p>
          <img src="images/NewTrainAltWindow.png" height="599" width="489" alt=
          "New train alternate window">
          <p>Any short name that identifies the train may be used, provided the name is not being
          used by another Active Train. DCC addresses must be a number in the range 1 - 9999.<br>
          Note: If the train will not be run automatically, the dcc address need not be accurate.
          This window is displayed if <strong>Trains from User Entry</strong> is selected as
          Dispatcher's train source.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the starting location of the Active Train is a Block within the selected Transit,
          check the <strong>Train in selected Transit</strong> box. If the starting location of the
          Active Train is outside the selected Transit, (in a Block connected to a Block within the
          selected Transit) uncheck this box. Checking and unchecking this box results in different
          selections in the <strong>Starting Location of Train:</strong> select box.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <strong>Starting Location of Train:</strong> from the select box. This select
          box lists all Blocks consistent with the check box above and the selected Transit. To
          identify each Block uniquely, the Block identifier consists of the Block display name
          followed by the sequence number of a Section in the Transit definition. If the train is
          located in the Transit, this sequence number identifies the Section where the train is
          located. If the train is located in a connected Block, the sequence number identifies the
          Section that will be entered when the train enters the Transit. If the train spans two
          blocks, select the Block where the engine is located.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <strong>Destination Location of Train:</strong> from the select box. This
          select box lists all Blocks consistent with the selected Transit that can be reached from
          the selected starting location by travel in the direction of the Transit. The Block
          identifier in the select box consists of the Block display name. If a Section is in the
          Transit more than once, the sequence number of the destination Section is appended to the
          Block identifier to identify the destination Block uniquely.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a id="allocateOptions"></a> Allocation Options <span class="since">since 4.9.5</span>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>As Far As Pos</strong> (Allocate As Far As Possible) - Select to allow
            Dispatcher, when using Auto Allocation, to allocate as far ahead of the Train as
            allowed by other circumstances such as an occupied Block. Allocation is of course also
            limited by the <strong>Destination Location of Train</strong> selection.</li>

            <li>
              <strong>To Safe Secs</strong> (Allocate to Safe Sections) - Choose this option if you
              have different trains going through a single Block in both directions.<br>
              Define Transits and mark as Safe the Sections that form passing places for opposing
              traffic. If there are Alternative Sections in the Transit, mark those as Safe as
              well.<br>
              Note: If you notice that, upon assignment, Turnouts are being set that were already
              set, you need to select "Trust Known State of Turnouts" in the <a href=
              "Options.shtml">Dispatcher Options</a>.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Number of Sections</strong> - When using Auto Allocation, Dispatcher will
            allocate ahead of the current location of the Train no more than the entered number of
            Sections set in the Spinner.<br>
            Because a value of 1 in the current version is known to cause unexpected results, be
            advised to set it to 2 or higher.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <strong>Reset when Done</strong> to set up the Active Train for continuous
          running. When checked, the train will restart based on the "Add Delay" value. When an
          Active Train has completed running through its Transit, it is immediately reset to run
          around its Transit again. Continuous running requires that the selected Transit be set up
          in a certain way--the first Section and the last Section must be the same. If the
          selected Transit is not capable of continuous running, the user is warned and
          <strong>Reset when Done</strong> remains unchecked.<br>
          For more information on setting up a Transit for continuous running see the
          <strong><a href="../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit Table</a></strong> help
          file.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <strong>Reverse at End</strong> to set up the Active Train for back and forth
          running. With <strong>Reverse at End</strong> selected, when an Active Train is has
          reached the end of its Transit, the Transit direction is reversed, and the Train backs up
          through the Transit to its starting point. For back and forth running, the Transit should
          have at least three Sections, one at each end and at least one in the middle, and the
          Active Train should fit into each of the end Sections. Continuous back and forth running
          is accomplished by also checking <strong>Reset when Done</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Enter a <strong>Priority</strong> for the Active Train relative to other Active Trains.
        Larger numbers are higher priority. The priority is used by the dispatcher and/or automated
        dispatching functions to arbitrate between Active Trains if multiple Active Trains are
        requesting the same resources.</li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <strong>Train Type</strong> from the <strong>Train Type:</strong> popup menu.
          The selected train type is displayed in the Dispatcher window to aid in allocation
          decisions.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the train is to start at a specified Fast Clock time, check the <strong>Delayed
          Start</strong> box, and enter the desired start time in the hour and minute fields of the
          <strong>Departure Time:</strong> entry. If the fast clock has not reached the specified
          Departure Time of an Active Train, the scheduled departure time is displayed in that
          Active Train's entry of the Active Train table in the Dispatcher window. If an Active
          Train is waiting for the fast clock, Dispatcher will refuse to allocate Sections to it,
          however, the dispatcher is given a chance to override this restriction. If an Active
          Train is being run automatically by the computer (see below), the Active Train will
          automatically start at the specified fast clock time. This option allows the dispatcher
          to set up a number of Active Trains which will start at various times during a
          session.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Check <strong>Load this Train at Startup</strong> to have Dispatcher automatically load
        this Train when Dispatcher starts. You must <strong>Save Train Info...</strong> for this
        flag to take effect on the next start.</li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <strong>Run Train Automatically</strong> to request that the Active Train be run
          automatically by the computer. If the Active Train is to be run manually by a human
          engineer, skip the next few steps; go directly to the third to last item of these
          instructions. Requesting <strong>Run Train Automatically</strong> will extend this window
          (see below) to display options that are only related to automatic running of trains.</p>
          <img src="images/NewTrainAutoWindow.png" height="777" width="577" alt=
          "new train auto window">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Requirements for automatic running are not validated until
          creation of an Active Train is requested.<br>
          More information about automatic running of Active Trains may be found in the
          <strong><a href="Dispatcher.shtml#automatic">Running Trains Automatically</a></strong>
          help page.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>In the <strong>Loco Speed Correction:</strong> field, enter a percentage (10 - 150%)
          to modify all train speed settings. If the locomotive runs <em>normally</em>, enter 100%.
          If the locomotive runs slower than normal, enter a factor between 100 and 150%. If the
          locomotive runs faster than normal, enter a factor less than 100%. This factor is
          designed to allow the user to compensate for differences between locomotives. The entered
          Correection factor multiplies all speed settings immediately before the speed is sent to
          the locomotive.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>In the <strong>Default Maximum Speed:</strong> field, enter a number (10 - 100%) to
          limit the maximum speed the Active Train will run. For example, entering 60% will limit
          the maximum speed to 60% of the possible speed setting. Maximum Speed can be used to make
          certain Active Trains, for example a local freight, to run slower than signals alone
          would determine. The Maximum Speed entered here is the starting value for the Maximum
          Speed. The Maximum Speed may be changed while running the train automatically by setting
          up <strong><a href="../beantable/ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a></strong> in the
          Transit. <strong>Actions</strong> that change the Maximum Speed can be used, for example,
          to slow an automatically running Active Train when it passes through a town on the
          layout.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <strong>Ramp Rate</strong>. When a train running automatically needs to
          change speed, the computer can send the new speed to the locomotive immediately
          (RAMP_NONE), or it can <strong>Ramp</strong> the speed to its new value (change the speed
          gradually) bringing the train to the new speed over a period of time. The Ramp Rate to
          use depends upon the decoder in the locomotive and how the decoder is set up. Some
          decoders have features that can change speed gradually (this decoder option is named
          differently for different decoders). If the decoder is doing the desired job, select
          RAMP_NONE. Otherwise select one of the ramp rates offered.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Use Speed Profile</strong> - If a locomotive has a <a href=
          "../roster/swing/speedprofile/SpeedProfileFrame.shtml">Speed Profile</a>, the speed will
          be set using the Warrant Preferences settings and the speed profile. So if the speed
          calls for "restricted", it looks that up in the Warrant Preferences, gets the required
          speed & units and uses the Profile to set the Throttle percentage.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Stop By Speed Profile</strong> The loco will begin to stop when it enters the
          Section and -if the profile is accurate and the block lengths are accurate- stop at the
          far end.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Adjust</strong> Set the percentage of the final Block length to be used for
          stopping when stopping By Speed Profiles is set. Small values in small Blocks tend to
          cause the loco to just stop.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <strong>Loco has sound decoder.</strong> if the locomotive has a sound decoder.
          If this item is not checked, <strong>Actions</strong> that require a sound decoder, such
          as ringing the bell or sounding the horn will be skipped.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <strong>Run in reverse</strong> if the locomotive is to be run in reverse
          through the Transit. This should not be confused with the direction through the Transit,
          which is always FORWARD when the Active Train starts up. Checking this item is equivalent
          to using the reverse setting on a manual throttle.<br>
          This option allows a locomotive to back up through the Transit. For example, a local
          moves out of a yard automatically in the forward direction to a siding, cars are switched
          manually, then the locomotive needs to back up automatically to the yard. This could be
          accomplished using two Active Trains, both running automatically. One would move the
          train from the yard to the siding with the locomotive moving forward, and the second one,
          using a different, but similar Transit would back from the siding to the yard, with the
          Active Train in reverse. This should also cover the situation where <em>forward</em> and
          <em>reverse</em> are backwards in the locomotive.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <strong>All cars have resistance wheels</strong> if the entire train is
          detectable by occupancy detectors of all Blocks in Sections in the Transit. There must be
          no gaps in detection if this option is checked. This usually means that all cars in the
          train will have resistance wheels. This is especially important for stopping Active
          Trains without using point sensors (Stopping Sensors in <strong><a href=
          "../beantable/SectionAddEdit.shtml">Sections</a></strong>). If an automatically running
          Active Train needs to stop in a Section, it will use a Stopping Sensor if one is present.
          If no Stopping Sensor is configured, and if the train will fit in the Section (see
          below), and if this option is checked, the train will stop when the previous Section
          becomes UNOCCUPIED. If this option is not checked, or if the train will not fit, the
          train is stopped when it enters the Section.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter the maximum length the train can have while traversing the Transit in the
          <strong>Maximum Train Length:</strong> field. The length should be entered in scale feet
          or scale meters, depending upon the dimension selection in the <strong><a href=
          "Options.shtml">Dispatcher Options</a></strong> accessed from Dispatcher's
          <strong>Options</strong> menu. Entering a reasonable value for the maximum length of the
          train is important for deciding if a train will fit in a Section when stopping the train
          (see above). When NOT stopping by Speed Profile, if the length of the train does not fit
          in a Block when stopping it is stopped immediately. Otherwise it is stopped as soon as
          the preceding Block goes UNOCCUPIED. Remember this uses <em>debounce timings</em>, which
          -if large- can result in the train overrunning the block if it only just fits.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Click <strong>Create</strong> after all the above have been set to create and activate
          the new Active Train. The new Active Train will immediately appear in the Dispatcher
          window, and this window will be dismissed.</p>

          <p>- OR -</p>
