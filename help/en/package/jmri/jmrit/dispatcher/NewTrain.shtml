      <h1>JMRI Dispatcher: Activate New Train</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The <b>Activate New Train</b> window supports the creation
      of a new <b>Active Train</b>. To create an Active Train, the
      dispatcher uses this window to assign a <b><a href=
      "../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit</a></b>, assign a
      train, and specify a starting Block (Train location at start)
      and an end Block (Train location when transit of the layout
      is complete). Options for the new <b>Active Train</b> are
      also set using this window.</p>

      <p>Transits are selected from the Transits defined in the
      Transit Table. Dispatcher will list all Transits that are
      not currently in Active Trains.</p>

      <p>Trains may come from any one of three sources:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Trains from Roster</b> - Dispatcher will list all
        trains in the JMRI Roster that are not currently in Active
        Trains.</li>

        <li><b>Trains from Trains</b> - Dispatcher will list all
        trains available from <a href=
        "../operations/Operations.shtml#Trains">Operations</a>
        that are not already in any Dispatcher Active Trains.</li>

        <li><b>Trains from User Entry</b> - Dispatcher will replace
        the train selection box in the Activate New Train window
        with two entry fields allowing the user to enter a Train
        name and a loco Address.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Dispatcher's train source is set by selecting one of the
      above in the <b><a href="Options.shtml">Options</a></b>
      window accessed from Dispatcher's <b>Options</b> menu.</p>

      <p>Active Trains must start from a Block in the selected
      Transit, or from a Block connected to a Block in the selected
      Transit. Active Trains must stop in a Block within the
      selected Transit. Transits have a direction, so for a
      starting Block outside the Transit to be a valid starting
      Block, entry to the Transit from the starting Block must
      result in travel in the Transit's defined direction. This
      window only allows selection of valid starting and stopping
      Blocks. Initially the first occupied block is selected for
      you in the combo box.<br>
      Note: If an expected Block is not in the starting Block
      selection box, it may be because of this requirement.</p>

      <a name="loadsave" id="loadsave"></a>
      <h2>Saving and Retrieving Active Train Information</h2>

      <span class="since">since 2.5.2</span>
      <p>To facilitate easy set up of Active Trains that are used
      more than once, Dispatcher provides for saving and loading
      train information from disk.</p>

      <p>To save your train information to disk, click the <b>Save
      Train Info...</b> button after all selections and options have
      been set up but <i>before</i> clicking the <b>Create</b>
      button. This will bring up a small window allowing
      you to name the saved train information file. The name you
      enter will be normalized automatically with any
      non-alphanumeric characters replaced, and a .xml suffix added
      if needed. Train information files are saved as .xml files in
      the <b>dispatcher</b> folder in the user's preferences area
      on disk.</p>

      <p>To load previously saved train information, click the
      <b>Load Train Info...</b> button immediately after the Activate
      New Train window is displayed. This will bring up a small
      window allowing you to select the train information file to
      load from all the train information files in the dispatcher
      folder. When a train information file is loaded all items in
      the Activate New Train window are set according to the saved
      train information if possible. If an item cannot be set, for
      example if the specified Transit is in use, a warning is
      displayed and a default selection is made. After loading, you
      may change any option or selection and again save your new
      train information, before clicking the <b>Create</b>
      button.</p>

      <p>To permanently remove an unneeded Train Info file from the
      <b>dispatcher</b> folder in your user preferences area, click
      the <b>Delete...</b> button, then select the train information
      file to be deleted.</p>

      <h2>Using the Activate New Train Window</h2>

      <p>To create a new <b>Active Train</b>, use the following
      procedure:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Click the <b>New Train...</b> button in the
          <b><a href="Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b> window
          to bring up the window shown below.</p><img src=
          "images/NewTrainWindow.png" height="567" width="434">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If you want to use saved Train information, click
          <b>Load Train Info...</b> See <a href="#loadsave">above</a>
          for more on loading Train information.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a Transit from the Transit selection box. The
          selected Transit specifies the route the Active Train
          will follow while running on the layout. Transits are
          displayed and new Transits are created using the
          <b><a href="../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit
          Table</a></b> accessed from the <b>Tables</b> submenu of
          the JMRI <b>Tools</b> menu. This Transit selection box
          will allow selection of any Transit in the Transit Table
          that is not in use by an Active Train.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the window shown above is displayed, select a train
          from the Train selection box. This window is displayed if
          the <b>Trains from Roster</b> or the <b>Trains from
          Trains</b> options are selected as Dispatcher's train
          source.</p>

          <p>- OR -</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          If <a href="Options.shtml">Dispatcher Options</a> is
          set to <b>Trains from User Entry</b>,
          the following pane is displayed.<br>
          Enter a train name in the <b>Train:</b> field, and set a numeric
          address from 1 to 9999 as the <b>DCC Address</b>.</p><img src=
          "images/NewTrainAltWindow.png" height="593" width="463">
          <p>
          Any short name that identifies the train may be used,
          provided the name is not being used by another Active
          Train. DCC addresses must be a number in the range 1 -
          9999.<br>
          Note: If the train will not be run automatically,
          the dcc address need not be accurate. This window is
          displayed if <b>Trains from User Entry</b> is selected as
          Dispatcher's train source.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the starting location of the Active Train is a
          Block within the selected Transit, check the <b>Train in
          selected Transit</b> box. If the starting location of the
          Active Train is outside the selected Transit, (in a Block
          connected to a Block within the selected Transit) uncheck
          this box. Checking and unchecking this box results in
          different selections in the <b>Starting Location of
          Train:</b> select box.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <b>Starting Location of Train:</b> from the
          select box. This select box lists all Blocks consistent
          with the check box above and the selected Transit. To
          identify each Block uniquely, the Block identifier
          consists of the Block system name, followed by the Block
          user name (in parentheses) followed by the sequence
          number of a Section in the Transit definition. If the
          train is located in the Transit, this sequence number
          identifies the Section where the train is located. If the
          train is located in a connected Block, the sequence
          number identifies the Section that will be entered when
          the train enters the Transit. If the train spans two
          blocks, select the Block where the engine is located.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <b>Destination Location of Train:</b> from
          the select box. This select box lists all Blocks
          consistent with the selected Transit that can be reached
          from the selected starting location by travel in the
          direction of the Transit. The Block identifier in the
          select box consists of the Block system name, followed by
          the Block user name (in parentheses). If a Section is in
          the Transit more than once, the sequence number of the
          destination Section is appended to the Block identifier
          to identify the destination Block uniquely.</p>
        </li>

        <li><a name="allocateOptions" id="allocateOptions"></a>
        Allocation Options <span class="since">since 4.9.5</span>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <b>As Far As Pos</b> (Allocate As Far As Possible) -
          Select to allow Dispatcher, when using Auto Allocation, to
          allocate as far ahead of the Train as allowed by other
          circumstances such as an occupied Block. Allocation is
          of course also limited by the
          <b>Destination Location of Train</b> selection.
          </li>
          <li>
          <b>To Safe Secs</b> (Allocate to Safe Sections) - Choose
          this option if you have different trains going through a
          single Block in both directions.<br>
          Define Transits and mark as Safe the Sections that form
          passing places for opposing traffic. If there are Alternative
          Sections in the Transit, mark those as Safe as well.<br>
          Note: If you notice that, upon assignment, Turnouts are being
          set that were already set, you need to select "Trust Known
          State of Turnouts" in the <a href=
          "Options.shtml">Dispatcher Options</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
          <b>Number of Sections</b> - When using Auto Allocation,
          Dispatcher will allocate ahead of the current location of the
          Train no more than the entered number of Sections set in the
          Spinner.<br>
          Because a value of 1 in the current version is known to cause
          unexpected results, be advised to set it to 2 or higher.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </li>


        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Reset when Done</b> to set up the Active
          Train for continuous running. When checked, the train
          will restart based on the "Add Delay" value. When an
          Active Train has completed running through its
          Transit, it is immediately reset to run around its
          Transit again. Continuous running requires that the
          selected Transit be set up in a certain way--the first
          Section and the last Section must be the same. If the
          selected Transit is not capable of continuous running,
          the user is warned and <b>Reset when Done</b> remains
          unchecked.<br>
          For more information on setting up a Transit
          for continuous running see the <b><a href=
          "../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit Table</a></b>
          help file.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Reverse at End</b> to set up the Active Train
          for back and forth running. With <b>Reverse at End</b>
          selected, when an Active Train is has reached the end of
          its Transit, the Transit direction is reversed, and the
          Train backs up through the Transit to its starting point.
          For back and forth running, the Transit should have at
          least three Sections, one at each end and at least one in
          the middle, and the Active Train should fit into each of
          the end Sections. Continuous back and forth running is
          accomplished by also checking <b>Reset when Done</b>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          Enter a <b>Priority</b> for the Active Train relative
          to other Active Trains. Larger numbers are higher priority.
          The priority is used by the dispatcher and/or automated
          dispatching functions to arbitrate between Active Trains if
          multiple Active Trains are requesting the same
          resources.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <b>Train Type</b> from the <b>Train Type:</b>
          popup menu. The selected train type is displayed in the
          Dispatcher window to aid in allocation decisions.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the train is to start at a specified Fast Clock
          time, check the <b>Delayed Start</b> box, and enter the
          desired start time in the hour and minute fields of the
          <b>Departure Time:</b> entry. If the fast clock has not
          reached the specified Departure Time of an Active Train,
          the scheduled departure time is displayed in that Active
          Train's entry of the Active Train table in the Dispatcher
          window. If an Active Train is waiting for the fast clock,
          Dispatcher will refuse to allocate Sections to it,
          however, the dispatcher is given a chance to override
          this restriction. If an Active Train is being run
          automatically by the computer (see below), the Active
          Train will automatically start at the specified fast
          clock time. This option allows the dispatcher to set up a
          number of Active Trains which will start at various times
          during a session.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          Check <b>Load this Train at Startup</b> to have
          Dispatcher automatically load this Train when Dispatcher
          starts. You must <b>Save Train Info...</b> for this flag to
          take effect on the next start.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Run Train Automatically</b> to request that
          the Active Train be run automatically by the computer. If
          the Active Train is to be run manually by a human
          engineer, skip the next few steps; go directly to the
          third to last item of these instructions. Requesting
          <b>Run Train Automatically</b> will extend this window
          (see below) to display options that are only related to
          automatic running of trains.</p><img src=
          "images/NewTrainAutoWindow.png" height="710" width="550">

          <p><b>Note:</b> Requirements for automatic running are
          not validated until creation of an Active Train is
          requested.<br>
          More information about automatic running of Active Trains
          may be found in the <b><a href=
          "Dispatcher.shtml#automatic">Running Trains
          Automatically</a></b> help page.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>In the <b>Loco Speed Correction:</b> field, enter a
          percentage (10 - 150&#37;) to modify all train speed settings. If the
          locomotive runs <i>normally</i>, enter 100&#37;. If the
          locomotive runs slower than normal, enter a factor
          between 100 and 150&#37;. If the locomotive runs faster than
          normal, enter a factor less than 100&#37;. This factor is
          designed to allow the user to compensate for differences
          between locomotives. The entered Correection factor multiplies
          all speed settings immediately before the speed is sent
          to the locomotive.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>In the <b>Default Maximum Speed:</b> field, enter a
          number (10 - 100&#37;) to limit the maximum speed the Active
          Train will run. For example, entering 60&#37; will limit the
          maximum speed to 60&#37; of the possible speed setting.
          Maximum Speed can be used to make certain Active Trains,
          for example a local freight, to run slower than signals
          alone would determine. The Maximum Speed entered here is
          the starting value for the Maximum Speed. The Maximum
          Speed may be changed while running the train
          automatically by setting up <b><a href=
          "../beantable/ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a></b>
          in the Transit. <b>Actions</b> that change the Maximum
          Speed can be used, for example, to slow an automatically
          running Active Train when it passes through a town on the
          layout.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select a <b>Ramp Rate</b>. When a train running
          automatically needs to change speed, the computer can
          send the new speed to the locomotive immediately
          (RAMP_NONE), or it can <b>Ramp</b> the speed to its new
          value (change the speed gradually) bringing the train to
          the new speed over a period of time. The Ramp Rate to use
          depends upon the decoder in the locomotive and how the
          decoder is set up. Some decoders have features that can
          change speed gradually (this decoder option is named
          differently for different decoders). If the decoder is
          doing the desired job, select RAMP_NONE. Otherwise select
          one of the ramp rates offered.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <b>Use Speed Profile</b> - If a locomotive has a <a href=
        "../roster/swing/speedprofile/SpeedProfileFrame.shtml">Speed Profile</a>,
        the speed will be set using the Warrant Preferences settings
        and the speed profile. So if the speed calls for "restricted",
        it looks that up in the Warrant Preferences, gets the required
        speed &amp; units and uses the Profile to set the Throttle
        percentage.
        </li>

        <li>
        <p><b>Stop By Speed Profile</b> The loco will begin to stop when
        it enters the Section and -if the profile is accurate and the
        block lengths are accurate- stop at the far end.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <p><b>Adjust</b> Set the percentage of the final Block length to be
        used for stopping when stopping By Speed Profiles is set. Small
        values in small Blocks tend to cause the loco to just stop.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Loco has sound decoder.</b> if the locomotive
          has a sound decoder. If this item is not checked,
          <b>Actions</b> that require a sound decoder, such as
          ringing the bell or sounding the horn will be
          skipped.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Run in reverse</b> if the locomotive is to be
          run in reverse through the Transit. This should not be
          confused with the direction through the Transit, which is
          always FORWARD when the Active Train starts up. Checking
          this item is equivalent to using the reverse setting on a
          manual throttle.<br>
          This option allows a locomotive to back up through the
          Transit. For example, a local moves out of a yard
          automatically in the forward direction to a siding, cars
          are switched manually, then the locomotive needs to back
          up automatically to the yard. This could be accomplished
          using two Active Trains, both running automatically. One
          would move the train from the yard to the siding with the
          locomotive moving forward, and the second one, using a
          different, but similar Transit would back from the siding
          to the yard, with the Active Train in reverse. This
          should also cover the situation where <i>forward</i> and
          <i>reverse</i> are backwards in the locomotive.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>All cars have resistance wheels</b> if the
          entire train is detectable by occupancy detectors of all
          Blocks in Sections in the Transit. There must be no gaps
          in detection if this option is checked. This usually
          means that all cars in the train will have resistance
          wheels. This is especially important for stopping Active
          Trains without using point sensors (Stopping Sensors in
          <b><a href=
          "../beantable/SectionAddEdit.shtml">Sections</a></b>). If
          an automatically running Active Train needs to stop in a
          Section, it will use a Stopping Sensor if one is present.
          If no Stopping Sensor is configured, and if the train
          will fit in the Section (see below), and if this option
          is checked, the train will stop when the previous Section
          becomes UNOCCUPIED. If this option is not checked, or if
          the train will not fit, the train is stopped when it
          enters the Section.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Enter the maximum length the train can have while
          traversing the Transit in the <b>Maximum Train
          Length:</b> field. The length should be entered in scale
          feet or scale meters, depending upon the dimension
          selection in the <b><a href=
          "Options.shtml">Dispatcher Options</a></b> accessed from
          Dispatcher's <b>Options</b> menu. Entering a reasonable
          value for the maximum length of the train is important
          for deciding if a train will fit in a Section when
          stopping the train (see above). When NOT stopping by
          Speed Profile, if the length of the train does not fit
          in a Block when stopping it is stopped immediately.
          Otherwise it is stopped as soon as the preceding Block goes
          UNOCCUPIED. Remember this uses <i>debounce timings</i>,
          which -if large- can result in the train overrunning the
          block if it only just fits.</p>
