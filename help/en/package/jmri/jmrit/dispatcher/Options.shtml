      <h1>JMRI: Dispatcher Options</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The <b>Dispatcher Options</b> pane provides for tailoring
      <b><a href="Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b>
      according to user needs and preferences. The <b>Options</b>
      menu provides access to these options and to
      another choice for saving Dispatcher Options to disk for later use.
      Both are described below.</p>

      <h2>Using Dispatcher Options</h2>
      <img src="images/OptionsWindow.png" height="649" width="606"
           style="float:right;margin:2em;">

      <p>Selecting <b>Dispatcher Options...</b> in the <b>Options</b>
      menu of the Dispatcher window brings up the pane shown at
      right.</p>

      <p>This window shows options currently set for
      Dispatcher. To change Dispatcher Options, change to the
      desired option configuration, and click the <b>Apply</b>
      button. All options are set to the selections in the Dispatcher Options
      pane, and the pane disappears. To close this pane without changing
      any options, click <b>Cancel</b>.<br>
      The available options are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Use connectivity from Layout Editor
          panel:</b> and select a Layout Editor panel (if there's
          more than one panel), if you have a Layout Editor panel
          that fully describes your layout, including blocks and
          turnouts, and would like Dispatcher to make use of this
          connectivity. Uncheck this item if no Layout Editor panel
          with full connectivity is available. If this item is
          checked, Dispatcher will automatically check if turnouts
          are set correctly when allocating a Section, and will
          inform the dispatcher if the turnouts are not set
          correctly. This item must be checked if Dispatcher is to
          set turnouts when a Section is allocated (see below), and
          if trains are to be run automatically.</p>
          <p>Select the type of Signaling control that is use on
          the panel from the drop down:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Signal Heads/SSL</b> - Uses (traditional)
            Signal Heads and Simple Signal Logic</li>

            <li><b>Signal Masts/SML</b> - Uses (more advanced) Signal
            Masts and associated Signal Mast Logic</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select one of these three options for Dispatcher to
          select Trains from when creating Active Trains:</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: none">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Trains from Roster</b> - Dispatcher will list
            all trains in the JMRI Roster that are not currently in
            Active Trains.</li>

            <li><b>Trains from Operations</b> - Dispatcher will list
            all trains available from Operations that are not in
            Active Trains.</li>

            <li><b>Trains from User Entry</b> - Dispatcher will
            replace the train selection box in the <b><a href=
            "NewTrain.shtml">Activate New Train</a></b> window with
            two entry fields allowing the user to enter a train
            name and a dcc Address.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Layout has block detection hardware</b> if
          block occupancy detection is available from the layout.
          Uncheck if the layout does not have block occupancy
          detection, or if Dispatcher should not make use of block
          occupancy detection. Block detection hardware is required
          for automatic running of trains.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Automatically allocate Sections to Active
          Trains</b> to activate automated allocation. Uncheck to
          deactivate automated allocation. This item is equivalent
          to the <b>Auto Allocate</b> option check box in
          Dispatcher's window above the <b>Allocated Sections</b>
          table. It is also equivalent to <b>Auto Allocate</b> in
          Dispatcher's <b>Options</b> menu. Checking it here, then
          saving Dispatcher Options (see below) will select Auto
          Allocate and Auto Release when Dispatcher is started.
          <b>Note: The current version of Dispatcher provides
          limited support for automated allocation of Sections</b>.
          Support will be enhanced in future versions.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Automatically set turnouts when a Section is
          allocated</b> to activate automatic setting of turnouts.
          Uncheck to deactivate automatic setting of turnouts. This
          item is equivalent to <b>Auto Set Turnouts</b> in
          Dispatcher's <b>Options</b> menu. This item requires that
          <b>Use connectivity from Layout Editor panel</b> be
          checked (see above). Turnouts will not be set unless the
          Section to be allocated is free and unoccupied, except
          for the first Section of an Active Train that starts in
          the Transit. If turnouts cannot be set, the dispatcher
          will be warned. When setting turnouts, Dispatcher only
          issues commands to set turnouts; it does not wait for
          turnouts to actually change. This item is required for
          automatic running of trains.<br>
          Note that signals dependent on those turnouts will not
          change until the turnout is changed, so Dispatcher may
          (indirectly) wait for turnouts to align.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Trust Known State of Turnouts?</b> to
          suppress sending of turnout commands if the known state
          already matches the desired state. This can be used where
          reliable turnout feedback is in place.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Use short Active Train names</b> to use the
          train name as the Active Train name in tables and
          selection boxes where Active Trains are referenced.
          Uncheck to use the full Active Train name in those
          locations.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Place train name in starting Block</b> to
          request that Dispatcher set the "value" of the starting
          Block to the train name when creating a new Active Train.
          Uncheck to suppress setting the starting Block value to
          the train name. This feature is designed to facilitate
          Train Tracking in Layout Editor panels.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Use alternate color for allocated Blocks</b>
          to use the Layout Editor alternate unoccupied color for
          allocated Blocks in Layout Editor panels. This option is
          designed to make it easier for the dispatcher to see
          which Sections have been allocated.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Check <b>Place train name in allocated Blocks</b> to
          place the name of the Active Train to which a Section is
          allocated as the value of Blocks of the Allocated
          Section. This feature, coupled with the above alternate
          color option, makes it easy for the dispatcher to see
          which Allocated Section is allocated to which Active
          Train when viewing a Layout Editor panel.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select layout scale in the <b>Layout Scale</b>
          selection box. The selected scale is used to convert
          Block length as used in automatic running of trains.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select the preferred <b>Units</b>, either <b>Scale
          Feet</b> or <b>Scale Meters</b> for referencing train
          length and block length in Dispatcher.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Minimum Throttle Interval</b> is used to manage
          throttle traffic, by sending throttle commands no more
          often than this value. Increasing this value reduces
          traffic on your DCC bus, but will affect "smoothness" of
          speed changes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="since">since 4.3.7</span>
          <p><b>Time to Fully Ramp</b> is used to calculate the
          Ramping values. Specifically, it is how long (in
          milliseconds) it would take to go from 0&#37; to 100&#37;.
          Increasing this value causes ramping operations to take
          longer.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="since">since 3.4</span>
          <p>Check the <b>Open Dispatcher with Panel</b> to open up
          the Dispatcher window when the panel file is loaded.
          Please note that this option is saved when the panel file
          itself and is saved and not when the "Save Options" is
          selected.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Important Note: Remember to save your Options</b> (see
      below). If new Dispatcher Options are not saved, they revert
      to the previous values the next time Dispatcher is run.</p>

      <h2>Using the Options Menu</h2>

      <p>The <b>Options</b> menu is used to access, edit, and save
      Dispatcher options. Items in this menu and their use are
      explained below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Auto Allocate</b> - This check box is used to turn
          automated allocation functions on (checked) or off
          (unchecked). This item is equivalent to the <b>Auto
          Allocate</b> option check box in Dispatcher's window
          above the <b>Allocated Sections</b> table. It is also is
          equivalent to an item in the <b>Options Window</b>.
          Automated dispatching may be turned on or off at any
          time. The item is repeated here for convenience of the
          dispatcher. <b>Note: Automated allocation of Sections has
          limited support in the current version of
          Dispatcher.</b></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Auto Set Turnouts</b> - This check box is used to
          turn on (checked) or off (unchecked) automatic setting of
          turnouts when Sections are allocated. This item is
          equivalent to an item in the Options Window. Automatic
          setting of turnouts may be turned on or off at any time,
          except for automatically running Active Trains. The item
          is repeated here for the convenience of the
          dispatcher.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Options Window...</b> - Selecting this item brings
          up the Options Window described above.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Save Options...</b> - Selecting this item saves
            Dispatcher Options to disk.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <a id="saveoptions" name="saveoptions"></a></a>
      <h2>Saving Dispatcher Options</h2>

          <p>To save the Dispatcher settings currently in effect into
          a small XML file (<i>dispatcheroptions.xml</i>) in the user's
          preferences directory, select <b>Save Options...</b> from the
          <b>Options</b> menu.</b> This is the same location where
          JMRI preference files are saved. When Dispatcher is
          started, if a file named "<i>dispatcheroptions.xml</i>"
          is found in the user's preference directory, that file is
          read, and Dispatcher options are set accordingly. If the
          file is not present when Dispatcher is started, default
          options are used. <b>Note: Dispatcher Options are not
          saved automatically.</b> Saving Dispatcher Options is
          optional. Selecting this menu item is the only way to
          save Dispatcher Options.</p>
