<H1>Allocated Sections Window
</H1>
<H2>Introduction
</H2
<p>The <b>Allocated Sections</b> window displays a table of all Sections 
currently allocated to Active Trains. This window serves two purposes.  It 
shows which Allocated Sections are allocated to which Active Trains, and it 
allows the dispatcher to <i>release</i> an Allocated Section for use by a 
different Active Train. This table could have been displayed in the Dispatcher 
window, but instead is displayed separately to allow more flexibility in arranging 
windows on the computer screen. This window may be minimized or dismissed using 
the standard items in its title bar. It is listed in the Window menu, which may 
be used to bring it to the front if it becomes buried.</p>
<p>The <b>Allocated Sections</b> window is requested by clicking the 
<b>Show Allocations...</b> button in the 
<b><a href="Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b> window. Clicking this 
button brings up the small window shown below.</p>
<img src="AllocatedSectionsWindow.jpg" height="171" width="543"/>
<p> The table has four columns as follows:
<li><p><b>Active Train</b> - Shows the Active Train to which the Section is assigned. 
Active Train names are displayed in either short form (shown above) or long form 
depending on the option selected in the Dispatcher's 
<b><a href="Options.shtml">Options</a></b> window.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Allocated Section</b> - Shows the name of the Section allocated to 
the Active Train on the left.<p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Occupancy</b> - Displays whether the Allocated Section is <b>OCCUPIED</b> 
by a train, or <b>UNOCCUPIED</b>. The Occupancy column is updated whenever 
the occupancy of the Allocated Section changes. If the user has not specified 
that the layout has occupancy detection in the Dispatcher's 
<b><a href="Options.shtml">Options</a></b> window, Occupancy for all Sections 
will be displayed as <b>UNKNOWN</b>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last column displays a <b>Release</b> button for each Allocated Section.
If the Release button is clicked, that Section is immediately <i>released</i>. Section status becomes <b>FREE</b>, and 
the Section is available for allocation to an Active Train.</p>
<p> Often a Section should not be released if it is still <b>OCCUPIED</b>. When 
an Active Train is terminated, all of its allocated Sections are automatically 
released, regardless of occupancy. The automated dispatcher will not release an 
<b>OCCUPIED</b> Section automatically. <b>Caution: With manual dispatching, the 
dispatcher is responsible for determining whether it is appropriate to release 
an OCCUPIED Section.</b></p>
