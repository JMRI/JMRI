      <h2>Introduction to Dispatcher</h2>

      <span class="since">since 2.3.5</span>
      <p>JMRI <strong>Dispatcher</strong> provides functions and organizes
      information relating to dispatching trains on a model
      railroad layout. Its main function is the allocation of
      sections of track to various trains running around the layout.
      Dispatcher is not designed to completely replace a human
      dispatcher during a session of running trains, but it should
      make the dispatching job easier and more fun. Dispatcher is
      envisioned to work alongside a Panel, constructed in either
      Layout Editor or Panel Editor, which provides visual feedback
      of layout status. An example of a Dispatcher Panel in
      action is shown next. No attempt was made to make Dispatcher
      look or feel <em>prototypical</em>. It was simply designed to
      be functional for dispatching a model railroad layout.</p>

      <p>Note that in this document "<em>Dispatcher</em>" refers to
      the JMRI Dispatcher software, and "<em>the dispatcher</em>"
      refers to the person running the Dispatcher software.<br>
      Many of the terms in this introduction to Dispatcher may
      be new to users. Some terms and settings were created
      specifically for use with Dispatcher. Please review
      the <strong><a href="#glossary">Glossary of Terms</a></strong>, and
      come back to it as needed when reading the remainder of
      this documentation.</p>

      <p>Functionality provided by Dispatcher includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support for train start up and termination</li>
        <li>Information to allow easy set up of meets at passing
        sidings</li>
        <li>Automation of some dispatcher functions</li>
        <li>Set up for automatic running of trains</li>
        <li>Support for starting trains according to a Fast Clock</li>
        <li>Support for linking signals to allocation via
        simple APB signaling support</li>
        <li>Optional automatic setting of turnouts when a section
        of track is allocated</li>
        <li>Fully automatic running of trains, along with manually
        run trains.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Central to <strong>Dispatcher</strong> is the concept of an
      <strong>Active Train</strong>, which carries the information needed
      to run a train around part of the layout.<br>
      Basically, an <strong>Active Train</strong> is created by the
      dispatcher by linking a <strong>Transit</strong> and a <strong>Train</strong>.
      The <strong><a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Transits.shtml">Transit</a></strong> provides a
      description of the itinerary to be followed by the Train,
      including which <strong><a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Sections.shtml">Sections</a></strong> need to be
      allocated in sequence along the route, and, when running
      automatically, any <strong><a href=
      "../beantable/ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a></strong> that
      need to be initiated in specific Sections.<br>
      The <strong>Train</strong> specifies what is to be run along the route
      defined in the Transit.
      Trains can be complete descriptions of all engines
      and cars as provided by JMRI <strong>Operations</strong>, or engines
      selected from the JMRI <strong>Roster</strong> menu, or simply a train
      name and dcc address entered by the dispatcher.</p>

      <p>When creating an Active Train, the dispatcher also
      specifies where the Active Train is <em>currently</em> located,
      and the location of the Active Train when it is <em>terminated</em>
      after it completes its transit of the layout. Other options are
      entered, like train Priority and Type, a request to start the
      Active Train at a specified Fast Clock time, and a request to run
      it Automatically.</p>

      <p>All Active Trains are displayed in a table in the
      <strong><a href="#window">The Dispatcher Window</a></strong>, along with
      status information about the Active Train.
      The Dispatcher Window also contains a table
      of pending <strong>Requested Allocations</strong>, a table of currently
      <strong>Allocated Sections</strong>, and buttons that allow the
      dispatcher to easily allocate Sections, create new Active
      Trains, and terminate Active Trains. Allocated Sections are
      released using buttons in the Allocated Sections table, or
      automatically if the <strong>Auto Release</strong> option is selected.
      The <strong>Dispatcher Window</strong> is
      discussed in detail <a href="#window">below</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The current version of Dispatcher contains
      an automated allocation option still under development. To
      request Dispatcher to attempt to automatically allocate
      Sections to Active Trains, select the <strong>Auto Allocate</strong>
      box. <strong>Auto Allocate</strong> (discussed in detail
      <a href="#autoallocate">below</a>)
      works fine for single Active Trains, and for some cases of
      multiple Active Trains. Enhancements are planned in future
      releases.</p>

      <a name="requirements" id="requirements"></a>
      <h2>Dispatcher Requirements</h2>

      <p>Dispatcher requires that a layout be divided into
      <strong>Blocks</strong>, and that Blocks along the mainline be
      organized into <strong><a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Sections.shtml">Sections</a></strong>.<br>
      It also requires that these Sections be used to define
      itineraries, called <strong><a href=
      "../../../../html/tools/Transits.shtml">Transits</a></strong>, that
      describe paths that trains will follow when active on the
      layout.</p>

      <!-- image by Egbert Broerse @silverailscolo 2018 -->

           alt="Dispatcher Sections Transits Concept Track Diagram">

      <p><strong>Blocks</strong> are portions of track whose occupancy
      can be monitored individually. <strong>Sections</strong> are groups of
      one or more Blocks that are <em>allocated</em> as a unit by the
      dispatcher using <strong>Dispatcher</strong> functions. <strong>Blocks</strong>
      are usually defined to support signaling on a layout.
      Simplest use of Dispatcher does not require that block
      detection hardware or signals be installed on the physical
      layout, or even that the physical layout be divided into
      blocks. Dispatcher will work if layout blocking is defined in
      a panel only. However, Dispatcher works best if hardware
      blocks with block detection are present. It works even better
      if hardware signals are present on the layout, and signal
      logic uses Section direction sensors.</p>

      <a name="glossary" id="glossary"></a>
      <h2>Glossary of Terms</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>Block</dt>
        <dd>A portion of track whose occupancy may be
        individually monitored. Blocks are defined by subdividing the
        track in a layout. Blocks normally correspond to physical
        blocks on a layout, each wired for occupancy detection.
        However, if the layout track is not subdivided into blocks,
        dividing a Layout Editor Panel track diagram into Blocks will
        allow Dispatcher to be used for manually running trains.<br>
        Hardware occupancy detection is also optional for manual running
        trains. More on
        <a href="../beantable/BlockTable.shtml">Blocks</a>.<br>
        Automatic running of trains requires hardware blocks
        and hardware occupancy detection. For all Dispatcher use,
        blocking of mainline track on a Layout Editor panel is
        required. Dispatcher works best if hardware block occupancy
        detection is present, but it can be used to run trains
        manually without it.</dd>

        <dt>Section</dt>
        <dd>A group of one or more connected
        <strong>Blocks</strong> that may be allocated to a train for travel in
        a given direction. Blocks are normally defined to facilitate
        signals. This often results in short Blocks, sometimes
        containing only one track switch. Sections allow Blocks to be
        grouped into track sections that are reasonable for a
        dispatcher to allocate. More information is contained in the
        <strong><a href="../../../../html/tools/Sections.shtml">Section
        Documentation</a></strong>, along with instructions on how to
        create a Section.</dd>

        <dt>Transit</dt>
        <dd>A group of two or more connected
        <strong>Sections</strong> that describes a route around the layout for
        a train traveling in a given direction. Transits are required
        for Dispatcher, and at least one must be defined before
        Dispatcher can be opened. Transits also contain information
        about user-specified actions when running Active Trains
        automatically. A detailed description of Transits, how they
        are created, and how they are used is contained in the
        <strong><a href="../../../../html/tools/Transits.shtml">Transit
        Documentation</a></strong></dd>

        <dt>Train</dt>
        <dd>An engine (or consist) usually attached to
        a group of cars, that travels around the layout as an entity.
        For use with Dispatcher, Trains may be selected from the list
        of engines in the JMRI engine Roster, selected from the Trains
        created in JMRI
        <a href="../operations/Operations.shtml">Operations</a>, or
        basic train information may be entered manually by the
        dispatcher.</dd>

        <dt>Active Train</dt>
        <dd>A combination of a Train and a
        Transit, along with other information and options. The Train
        describes what is traveling, and the Transit describes where
        it is going. Details are filled in by other information and
        options selected when the Active Train is created. Active
        Trains are central to Dispatcher. How Active Trains are used
        is described in detail <a href="#transits">below</a>.
        <strong><a href="#atrains">Active Trains Table</a></strong> provides more
        details. Active Trains are created and terminated from the
        <a href="#window">Dispatcher Window.</a></dd>

        <dt>Auto Active Train</dt>
        <dd>An Active Train that is run
        automatically by a <em>virtual engineer</em> instead of
        manually by a human engineer. An Auto Active Train is a
        special type of Active Train that is operated automatically
        by the computer using a computer throttle. Automatic
        operation is requested by the dispatcher when the Active
        Train is created. Auto Active Trains are described in detail
        <a href="#automatic">below</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Requested Allocations</dt>
        <dd>A request to allocate (assign)
        a <strong>Section</strong> for the exclusive use of an <strong>Active
        Train</strong>. Allocation Requests that are not immediately acted
        upon are gathered in a queue that is displayed in the
        Dispatcher window. Fulfilling an Allocation Request may be
        delayed for a number of reasons, for example, if the
        requested Section is not FREE, but is allocated to a
        different Active Train, or if the dispatcher is setting up a
        meet. Allocation Requests are acted upon manually by the
        dispatcher, or automatically if using the <strong>Auto
        Allocate</strong> option.</dd>

        <dt>Allocated Section</dt>
        <dd><strong>Section</strong> that is
        currently assigned to an <strong>Active Train</strong> for its
        exclusive use. When a Section is allocated, if there are
        alternate Sections following the Allocated Section, the
        dispatcher must choose the next Section from the alternate
        Sections contained in the Transit. A table listing all
        Allocated Sections is displayed in the Dispatcher window. The
        Allocated Sections table is where Sections are released,
        either manually by the dispatcher, or automatically if using
        the <strong>Auto Release</strong> option.</dd>

        <dt>Alternate Section</dt>
        <dd>An <em>alternate</em> <strong>Section</strong> connecting two Sections
        in a <strong>Transit</strong>.
        In user-specified areas of a Transit, <em>alternate</em>
        Sections may be designated. For example, to move between the
        "2nd" and "4th" Sections in a Transit, there may be multiple
        "3rd" Sections, any of which might be used to travel between
        the 2nd and 4th Sections. Alternate Sections provide for
        passing tracks and staging yards.</dd>

        <dt>Safe Section</dt>
        <dd><strong>Sections</strong> in a <strong>Transit</strong> where Trains in
        opposing directions can pass without blocking the other Train,
        are marked as <strong>Safe</strong>. This is not a property of a Section
        itself, but is to be determined during creation of a Transit.
        Active Trains can then be allocated To Safe Sections.</dd>
      </dl>

      <a name="transits" id="transits"></a>
      <h2>Using Transits and Sections in Dispatching Active
      Trains</h2>

      <p>When a <strong>Transit</strong> is paired with a <strong>Train</strong> to
      form an <strong>Active Train</strong>, the starting Block (Active Train
      location at start) and ending Block (Active Train location
      when the travel is complete) are specified. The Active Train
      is referred to by its Train name and its Transit name, each
      of which must be unique among Active Trains. A Train and a
      Transit may be in only one Active Train at a time. When an
      Active Train is terminated, its Transit and its Train are
      <em>deactivated</em>, and both may be reused in different
      Active Trains.</p>

      <p>Either an Active Train starts from a Block outside of the
      Transit, but connected to a Block within the Transit, or an
      Active Train starts from any Block within a Section in the
      Transit. When an Active Train starts, it moves through a
      Transit in one direction (FORWARD)--defined by the order in
      which Sections are included in the Transit. Trains move from
      lower sequence number Sections toward higher sequence number
      Sections. To facilitate back and forth running, an option is
      available for an active train to reverse itself upon reaching
      the end of its Transit, and back up through the Transit to
      the first Section of the Transit. To facilitate continuous
      running of an Active Train, and option is available to
      automatically restart the Active Train after the Transit is
      completed.</p>

      <p>When an Active Train is created, an <strong>Allocation
      Request</strong> is placed for a starting <strong>Section</strong>. If the
      Section is free, the Section will be <em>allocated</em> to the
      Active Train. <em>Allocation</em> means that the Section is
      assigned to the Active Train, and the Active Train is
      authorized by the dispatcher to proceed to the end of that
      Section.</p>

      <p>An Active Train may be run by an engineer using a
      throttle, or automatically by the computer. Dispatching for
      the Active Train consists of <em>allocating</em> Sections, one
      by one, to the Active Train, and holding the Active Train in
      a Section when its needs conflict with the needs of other
      Active Trains. The actual allocation may be done by the
      dispatcher by manually clicking buttons in the Dispatcher
      Window, or the dispatcher may request <strong>Auto Allocate</strong> by
      checking <strong>Auto Allocate</strong> above the Allocated Sections
      table or by selecting it in the <strong><a href=
      "Options.shtml">Options</a></strong> menu of the Dispatcher
      window, and allow the computer do some of the routine work.
      If a requested Section is currently in use, an Allocation
      Request is placed in the Requested Allocations table in the
      Dispatcher window.</p>

      <p>For Auto Active Trains (Active Trains run automatically),
      Transits provide for <strong><a href=
      "../beantable/ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a></strong> to be
      initiated when a train is in a Section of the Transit.
      Actions are set up when Transits are created or edited in the
      <strong><a href="../beantable/TransitTable.shtml">Transit
      Table</a></strong>.</p>

      <a name="window" id="window"></a>
      <h2>The Dispatcher Window</h2>

      <p>The <strong>Dispatcher</strong> window is opened when
      <strong>Dispatcher...</strong> is selected in the JMRI <strong>Tools</strong>
      menu.</p>

      <p>It displays a table of <strong>Active Trains</strong> and their
      status, a table of pending <strong>Requested Allocations</strong>, and a table
      of <strong><a href="#allocated">Allocated Sections</a></strong>.  It provides buttons
      that allow the dispatcher to easily allocate Sections, create new Active Trains,
      terminate Active trains, etc.  The Dispatcher window buttons are discussed below.
      The <strong><a href="#atrains">Active Trains</a></strong> table and the
      <strong><a href="#arequests">Requested Allocations</a></strong> table are
      discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>

      <p>The sequence of columns in each table can be changed by dragging the column
      header.  The visibility of individual columns can be changed by using the right
      click context menu and clicking on the column name. The ID columns have been
      hidden in the images to reduce clutter.</p>

      <p>A typical Active Trains window early in a train running
      session might look like this:</p>
      <img src="images/DispatcherWindow.png" width="1194" height="705" alt="Dispatcher Window">

      <p>In the example above, two Active Trains have been
      created:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The top Active Train, Amtrak 139, has been allocated a
        Section and is RUNNING in MANUAL mode (manual throttle).</li>
        <li>The second Active Train, GTW 6418, is scheduled to start
        at 8:15 on the fast clock, and will run in DISPATCHED mode.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>Allocation Requests
      have been entered for the next Sections needed by the two
      Active Trains. The requested Sections are FREE and
      UNOCCUPIED, so the dispatcher could allocate either of them
      by clicking the <strong>Allocate</strong> button in the Requested
      Allocations table or the <strong>Allocate Next</strong> button in the
      Active Trains table. Allocating a Section to GTW 6418 would
      require the dispatcher override its scheduled start time. The
      Sections currently allocated to the two Trains are shown in
      the Allocated Sections table.</p>

      <p>The four buttons below the Active Trains table are
      described below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>New Train...</strong> - Click this button to bring up an
          <strong>Activate New Train</strong> window that allows the
          dispatcher to create an Active Train. The Train source
          used by this window is set in <strong><a href=
          "Options.shtml">Dispatcher Options</a></strong>. More information
          on creating new Active Trains may be found in the help
          file for the <strong><a href="NewTrain.shtml">Activate New
          Train</a></strong> window, along with a simple procedure to
          follow when creating an Active Train. Dispatcher Options
          should not be changed with the Activate New Train window
          open.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Allocate Extra...</strong> - Click this button to bring
          up a pane that allows the dispatcher to allocate
          Sections to an Active Train that may not be the "next"
          Section in the Active Train's Transit. Any Section that
          is FREE and is connected to an Allocated Section of the
          Active Train may be allocated to the Active Train using
          this pane. More information and a simple procedure for
          allocating extra Sections may be found in the
          <strong><a href="AllocateExtra.shtml">Allocate Extra</a></strong> help.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Cancel Auto Restart...</strong> - Click this button to
          cancel Auto Restart of an Active Train. This button
          provides the dispatcher with a way to stop trains that
          have been set up for continuous running. If there is only
          one Active Train that is set up for continuous running,
          Auto Restart is turned off for that Active Train when
          this button is pressed. If there is more than one Active
          Train set up for Auto Restart, a small window appears to
          allow the dispatcher to select which Active Train should
          no longer Auto Restart when completing its transit
          through the layout. To avoid possible conflicts, this
          button is not active when the <strong><a href=
          "NewTrain.shtml">Activate New Train</a></strong> window is
          open.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Terminate Train</strong> - Click this button to
          <strong><em>terminate</em></strong> an <strong>Active Train</strong>. If
          there's more than one Active Train, a dialog pane
          appears to allow the selection of which <strong>Active
          Train</strong> the dispatcher wants to terminate. When an
          Active Train is terminated, all Sections allocated to it
          are automatically released. The Train and Transit are
          freed up to be used in other Active Trains as needed.</p>

          <p>An Active Train is usually terminated when it reaches
          its destination Block, however, it may be terminated at
          any point during its transit of the layout. The
          dispatcher is responsible for deciding whether it is
          appropriate to terminate an Active Train before it
          reaches its destination.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Dispatcher options allow tailoring of the dispatcher
      function. The pane to set these options is accessed via the Dispatcher
      window's <strong>Options</strong> menu. Descriptions of items available in the
      Dispatcher Options pane, and of the Options menu, are contained in
      the <strong><a href="Options.shtml">Dispatcher Options</a></strong> help.</p>

      <h3>The Active Trains Table</h3>

      <p>The Active Trains table from the above Dispatcher
      example is repeated below.</p>
      <img src="images/ActiveTrainsTable.png" width="1194" height="111" alt="Active trains table">

      <p>Each row of the <strong>Active Trains</strong> table corresponds to one
      Active Train. The columns are as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Transit ID</strong> - The system name of the Transit of the Active
          Train is shown.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Transit</strong> - The user name of the Transit of the Active
          Train is shown.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Train</strong> - The name of the Train of the Active
          Train is shown.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Train Type</strong> - The train type selected when the
          Active Train was set up is shown. Allowed types are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>none - Nothing is displayed if no Train Type was
            selected.</li>

            <li><strong>LOCAL_PASSENGER</strong></li>

            <li><strong>LOCAL_FREIGHT</strong></li>

            <li><strong>THROUGH_PASSENGER</strong></li>

            <li><strong>THROUGH_FREIGHT</strong></li>

            <li><strong>EXPRESS_PASSENGER</strong></li>

            <li><strong>EXPRESS_FREIGHT</strong></li>

            <li><strong>MOW</strong> - Maintenance Of Way</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Train Status</strong> - Active Train status is displayed
          here. An Active Train may have any one of the following
          statuses:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>RUNNING</strong> - Actively running on the layout,
            according to its mode of operation.</li>

            <li><strong>PAUSED</strong> - Paused waiting for a user-specified
            number of fast clock minutes. The Active Train is
            expected to move to either RUNNING or WAITING once the
            specified number of minutes has elapsed. This is
            intended for automatic station stops. (Automatically
            running trains only)</li>

            <li><strong>WAITING</strong> - Stopped waiting for a Section
            allocation. This is the status the Active Train is in
            when it is created.</li>

            <li><strong>WORKING</strong> - Performing work under control of a
            human engineer. This is the status an Active Train
            assumes when an engineer is picking up or setting out
            cars at industries or in a yard. (Automatically running
            trains only)</li>

            <li><strong>READY</strong> - Indicates the Active Train has
            completed WORKING, and is <em>awaiting</em> a restart -
            dispatcher clearance to resume running. (Automatically
            running trains only)</li>

            <li><strong>STOPPED</strong> - An automatically running train was
            stopped by the dispatcher. The dispatcher must resume
            automatic operation when appropriate.</li>

            <li><strong>DONE</strong> - Indicates the Active Train has
            reached its destination and is ready to be terminated
            by the dispatcher.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some Active Trains will not use all the
          above statuses.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Mode</strong> - Mode of operation of the Active Train is
          displayed. The following modes are allowed:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>DISPATCHED</strong> - Indicates the Active Train is
            run by a human operator using a throttle. The
            dispatcher will allocate Sections to the Active Train
            as needed, control optional signals using a CTC panel
            or computer logic, and arbitrate any conflicts between
            Active Trains. If signals are present, the operator is
            expected to follow signals as set by the computer or
            the dispatcher.</li>

            <li><strong>AUTOMATIC</strong> - Indicates the Active Train will
            be run under automatic control of the computer. Under
            AUTOMATIC running, the computer is expected to follow
            signals set by the dispatcher or computer logic.
            Actions will occur, as described above. If the Active
            Train reaches a Section where work must be done (e.g.
            setting out or picking up cars), the mode of operation
            changes to MANUAL until the work is complete. When the
            dispatcher resumes automatic operation after MANUAL
            work has been completed,the mode is changed back to
            AUTOMATIC.</li>

            <li><strong>MANUAL</strong> - Indicates an Active Train running
            in AUTOMATIC mode has reached an Action in its Transit
            that requires MANUAL operation. When this happens, the
            status changes to WORKING, and the mode changes to
            MANUAL. While in MANUAL mode, the Active Train is run
            by a human operator using a throttle. AUTOMATIC running
            is resumed by the dispatcher when the work has been
            completed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Allocated Section ID</strong> - Displays the system name of the
          <strong>Section</strong> of the <strong>Transit</strong> that was last
          allocated to this Active Train.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Allocated Section</strong> - Displays the user name of the
          <strong>Section</strong> of the <strong>Transit</strong> that was last
          allocated to this Active Train.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Next Section ID</strong> - Displays the system name of the
          <strong>Section</strong> of the <strong>Transit</strong> that will need to be
          allocated next.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Next Section</strong> - Displays the user name of the
          <strong>Section</strong> of the <strong>Transit</strong> that will need to be
          allocated next.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Allocate Next Button</strong> - Click this button to
          request that the <strong>Section</strong> shown in the <strong>Next
          Allocation</strong> column be allocated to this Active Train.
          If the Section is FREE and not occupied it will be
          allocated immediately, and the Sections in the Allocated
          Section and Next Section columns will be updated.</p>

          <p>If the Section is not FREE, an <strong>Allocation
          Request</strong> will be entered into the <strong>Requested
          Allocations</strong> table (see below). If the Section is FREE,
          but is OCCUPIED, the dispatcher will be queried. The
          dispatcher is responsible for deciding whether an
          OCCUPIED Section should be allocated. If the Next Section
          is the first Section to be allocated, and the Active
          Train is occupying that Section, Dispatcher knows that
          allocating the OCCUPIED Section is appropriate, so the
          dispatcher is not queried.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Terminate Train Button</strong> - Terminate the train and release
          its resources.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>AutoRestart</strong> - Enable or Disable automatic restart.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Auto</strong> - Checked if the train was defined as an automatic train.
          The value cannot be changed.</p>

      <h3>The Requested Allocations Table</h3>

      <p>The Requested Allocations Table from the above example
      Dispatcher window is shown below.</p><img src=
      "images/RequestedAllocationsTable.png" width="978" height="117" alt="Requested allocations table">

      <p>This table, headed <strong>Requested Allocations waiting for
      Dispatch</strong>, displays pending <strong>Allocation Requests</strong>.
      Each row corresponds to one <strong>Allocation Request</strong>.
      The columns are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Transit ID</strong> - The transit system name.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Transit</strong> - The transit user name.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Train</strong> - Shows the <strong>Active Train</strong>
          requesting the Section. Active Train names are displayed
          in either short form (shown above) or long form depending
          on the option selected in the Dispatcher's <strong><a href=
          "Options.shtml">Options</a></strong> window.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Priority</strong> - Shows the priority of the <strong>Active
          Train</strong> requesting the Section. Larger numbers are
          higher priority. If two Active Trains are requesting the
          same Section, the higher priority Active Train would
          normally take precedence.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Train Type</strong> - The train type selected when the
          Active Train was set up is shown. Allowed types are:</p>

          <ul>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Section Status</strong> - Shows the allocation status of
          the requested <strong>Section</strong>. The Section will be
          either:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>FREE</strong> - Available for allocation.</li>

            <li><strong>ALLOCATED</strong> - Allocated to a different Active

          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Occupancy</strong> - Shows the occupancy of the
          requested <strong>Section</strong>. Three entries are possible:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>UNOCCUPIED</strong> - Nothing is detected in any
            Block of the Section. (The occupancy sensors of all
            Blocks in the Section are INACTIVE.)</li>

            <li><strong>OCCUPIED</strong> - Something is detected in one of
            the Blocks of the Section. (The occupancy sensor of at
            least one Block in the Section is ACTIVE.)</li>

            <li><strong>UNKNOWN</strong> - The occupancy status of at least
            one of the Blocks of the Section is not known. This
            indicates that the occupancy sensor of at least one
            Block in the Section is neither ACTIVE nor INACTIVE.
            <strong>- OR-</strong> The Dispatcher option <strong>"Layout has block
            detection hardware"</strong> is not checked - see
            <strong><a href="Options.shtml">Dispatcher

          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Length</strong> - The length of the requested Section in
          either scale feet or scale meters depending upon the
          units choice set in <strong><a href="Options.shtml">Dispatcher
          Options</a></strong>. The Section length is calculated from
          the lengths of its Blocks as entered in the <strong><a href=
          "../beantable/BlockTable.shtml">Block Table</a></strong>
          accessed from the Tools -&gt; Tables JMRI submenu.
          Section length is important for stopping trains run in
          AUTOMATIC mode.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Allocate Button</strong> - Click this button to request
          immediate allocation of the Section to the requesting
          Active Train. If the Section is FREE, and if the Section
          occupancy is either UNOCCUPIED or UNKNOWN, the Section
          will be allocated to the requesting Active Train. If the
          Section is FREE, but the Section is OCCUPIED, the
          dispatcher is prompted to either override the occupancy
          or wait.</p>

          <p>If the Section is ALLOCATED to another Active Train,
          the button click will be ignored. A Section may be
          allocated to only one Active Train at a time. If an
          ALLOCATED Section needs to be reallocated to a different
          Active Train, it must first be <strong>released</strong>. (See the
          <strong><a href="#allocated">Allocated
          Sections</a></strong> help for instruction on
          <em>releasing</em> Allocated Sections.)</p>

          <p>If "<em>Use connectivity...</em>" is checked in
          <strong>Dispatcher Options</strong>, Dispatcher will check that
          turnouts are set correctly before actually allocating a
          Section. If turnouts are not set correctly, Dispatcher
          will attempt to set the turnouts if <strong>Auto Set
          Turnouts</strong> is checked in the <strong>Options</strong> menu (or
          checked in the <strong>Dispatcher Options</strong> window).
          If turnouts are not set correctly, the dispatcher is
          warned and given the option of overriding the turnout
          check and proceeding with allocation of the Section.<br>

      <h3>The Allocated Sections Table</h3>

      <p>The <strong>Allocated Sections</strong> table displays all Sections
      currently allocated to Active Trains. This table serves two
        purposes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It shows which Allocated Sections are allocated to
          which Active Trains, and</li>
          <li>it allows the dispatcher to <em>release</em> an Allocated
          Section for use by a different Active Train.</li>
        </ol>
      <img src="images/AllocatedSectionsTable.png" width="808" height="181" alt="Allocated sections table">

      <p>The table columns are as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Transit ID</strong> - The transit system name.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Transit</strong> - The transit user name.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Train</strong> - Shows the Active Train to which
          the Section is assigned. Active Train names are displayed
          in either short form (shown above) or long form depending
          on the option selected in the Dispatcher's <strong><a href=
          "Options.shtml">Options</a></strong> window.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Allocated Section ID</strong> - Shows the sysetm name of the
          Section allocated to the Active Train on the left.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Allocated Section</strong> - Shows the user name of the
          Section allocated to the Active Train on the left.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Occupancy</strong> - Displays whether the Allocated
          Section is <strong>OCCUPIED</strong> by a train, or
          <strong>UNOCCUPIED</strong>. The Occupancy column is updated
          whenever the occupancy of the Allocated Section changes.
          If the user has not specified that the layout has
          occupancy detection in the Dispatcher's <strong><a href=
          "Options.shtml">Options</a></strong> window, Occupancy for all
          Sections will be displayed as <strong>UNKNOWN</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Use Status</strong> - Displays whether the Allocated
          Section has been used by its train. The Use Status column
          shows either <em>Not Entered</em>, <em>Entered</em>, or
          <em>Exited</em>. The Use Status of the Allocated Section
          changes as the occupancy of the Allocated Section
          changes. An Active Train is assumed to be done with an
          Allocated Section if its Use Status is <em>Exited</em>. The
          <strong>Auto Release</strong> option looks for Allocated Sections
          that have an <em>Exited</em> Use Status. If the user has
          not specified that the layout has occupancy detection in
          the Dispatcher's <strong><a href=
          "Options.shtml">Options</a></strong> window, Use Status will
          not display correctly.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The last column displays a <strong>Release</strong> button for
          each Allocated Section. If the Release button is clicked,
          that Section is immediately <em>released</em>. Section
          status becomes <strong>FREE</strong>, and the Section is available
          for allocation to an Active Train.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <a id="autoallocate" name="autoallocate"></a>
      <h4>Auto Allocate</h4>
      <p>The <strong>Auto Allocate</strong> check box, immediately above the
      <strong>Allocated Sections</strong> table, is used to switch on
      (checked) or off (unchecked) the automated allocation option.
      If <strong>Auto Allocate</strong> is off, the dispatcher is responsible
      for allocating all <strong>Sections</strong> using the <strong>Allocate</strong>
      button of the <strong>Allocation Request</strong> in the Requested
      Allocations table or the <strong>Allocate Next</strong> button of the
      <strong>Active Train</strong> in the Active Trains table (see
      above).</p>

      <p>The <strong>Auto Allocate</strong> option works cautiously. It will
      never allocate an <strong>OCCUPIED</strong> Section. It will never
      override a fast clock start time. It will attempt to avoid
      gridlock by looking ahead to see if a requested Section will
      be needed by another Active Train that has started. When
      possible, it attempts to allocate three Sections ahead of the
      current position of the head of each Active Train.</p>

      <p>The current version of <strong>Auto Allocate</strong> works fine for
      single Active Trains and for multiple Active Trains whose
      Transits don't overlap. It has limited support for
      simultaneous Active Trains that require the same Sections.
      Future versions will contain enhanced support for multiple
      Active Trains.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Auto Release</strong> check box, immediately above the
      <strong>Allocated Sections</strong> table, is used to switch on
      (checked) or off (unchecked) the automated release option. If
      <strong>Auto Release</strong> is off, the dispatcher is responsible for
      releasing <strong>Allocated Sections</strong> using the Allocated
      Section's <strong>Release</strong> button (see above). If <strong>Auto
        Release</strong> is on, the program will automatically release
      <strong>Allocated Sections</strong> which are <strong>UNOCCUPIED</strong>, show a
      <strong>Use Status</strong> of <em>Exited</em>, and are next-in-line to
      be released. <strong>Auto Release</strong> will only release
      <strong>Allocated Sections</strong> in the order in which they were
      allocated. <strong>Auto Release</strong> will not release Sections
      allocated using the <a href="AllocateExtra.shtml"><strong>Allocate
        Extra...</strong></a> button. Extra Allocated Sections must be
      released manually by the dispatcher.</p>

      <p>Often a Section should not be released if it is still
      <strong>OCCUPIED</strong>. When an Active Train is terminated, all of
      its Allocated Sections are automatically released, regardless
      of occupancy. <strong>Auto Release</strong> will not release an
      <strong>OCCUPIED</strong> Section automatically. <strong>Caution: The
        dispatcher is responsible for determining whether it is
        appropriate to release an OCCUPIED Section.</strong></p>

      <p>The dispatcher may turn <strong>Auto Release</strong> and <strong>Auto
      Allocate</strong> on and off at any time. Also the dispatcher may
      override the automatic allocation process by allocating a
      Section that the Auto Allocate option is refusing to
      allocate. Turning off <strong>Auto Allocate</strong> cancels any plans
      the option might be working on involving multiple Active
      Trains. <strong>Note: Auto Allocate and Auto Release require
      reliable block occupancy hardware to operate
      dependably</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Running Trains Automatically with Dispatcher</h2>

      <p>Dispatcher supports running trains around the layout
      automatically, provided the layout meets minimum
      requirements. Once an automatic Active Train (called an
      <strong>Auto Active Train</strong>) is created, it is run automatically
      by a <em>virtual engineer</em> using a computer throttle. The
      Auto Active Train follows signals around the layout, and
      performs user-specified <strong><a href=
      "../beantable/ViewSpecialActions.shtml">Actions</a></strong>,
      separate from Dispatcher. When an Active Train is created by
      the dispatcher, automatic running may be requested in the
      <strong><a href="NewTrain.shtml">Activate New Train</a></strong>
      window, and options specific to the Auto Active Train are set
      at that time.</p>

      <p>The dispatcher allocates Sections to an <strong>Auto Active
      Train</strong> in the same manner as allocating Sections to an
      Active Train run manually by a human engineer. From the
      dispatcher point-of-view, Auto Active Trains are treated the
      same as manually run Active Trains. There are two exceptions
      to this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>When an Auto Active Train derails or otherwise
          misbehaves, the dispatcher may need to take over control
          of that Auto Active Train from the <em>virtual
          engineer</em> to correct the problem. When the first Auto
          Active Train is created, an <strong><a href="AutoTrains.shtml">Auto
          Trains</a></strong> window is
          created to the right of the Dispatcher window. This
          window has an entry for each Auto Active Train currently
          active on the layout. Functions in each entry allow the
          dispatcher to easily take over control of an Auto Active
          Train, to operate it as required to correct the
          malfunction, and to resume automatic operation once the
          problem is fixed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>One of the user-specified <strong>Actions</strong> is <strong>Go to
          Manual Mode</strong>. This Action supports running an Auto
          Active Train automatically to a work site, where a human
          engineer takes over to preform operations (perhaps
          switching cars), after which automatic running is
          continued following the same Transit. After the human
          engineer has completed work, the human engineer informs
          the dispatcher that automatic operation may be resumed.
          The dispatcher resumes automatic operation using a button
          in the Auto Active Train's entry in the
          <a href="AutoTrains.shtml">AutoTrains</a> pane.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><span class="since">since 4.3.7</span>Support is provided
      for <strong>RAMPING</strong> the speed of an
      Auto Active Train when changing from its current speed to a
      new speed. This option is controlled by selecting a Ramp Rate
      for each Auto Active Train when it is created. The best Ramp
      Rate for an Auto Active Train depends upon that train's
      locomotive engine, the type of decoder, and settings of the
      decoder CV's. Available Ramp Rates are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>RAMP_NONE</strong> - Ramping is turned off. When a speed
          change occurs, the new speed is immediately sent to the
          decoder. Some decoders have features that can change
          speed gradually (this decoder option is named differently
          for different decoders). If the decoder is doing the
          desired job, select RAMP_NONE.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>RAMP_FAST</strong> - Change to new speed in steps, but
          quickly. This is probably appropriate for most
          decoders.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>RAMP_MEDIUM</strong> - Changes to new speed in steps
          about twice as slow as RAMP_FAST.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>RAMP_MED_SLOW</strong> - Changes to new speed in steps
          about three times slower than RAMP_FAST.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>RAMP_SLOW</strong> - Changes to new speed in steps about
          four times slower than RAMP_FAST. Too slow for almost all
          decoders.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note: Overall ramping rates can be adjusted in Dispatcher
      <a href="Options.shtml">Options</a>.</p>

      <p>When traversing the layout, an Auto Active Train changes
      speed in response to the signals it passes. If the next
      signal it faces is dark, red or flashing red, the train will
      stop in the current Section (see below). If the facing signal
      is green or flashing green, the train will run at its
      <em>maximum allowed speed</em>. If the facing signal is yellow
      or flashing yellow, the train will run at a reduced speed of
      35&#37; of the allowable speed range.</p>

      <p>If using SignalMasts, the speed between two SignalMasts is
      set to the lesser of the SignalMast indicated speed vs. the
      Block and Turnout speed for that path. This allows you to
      specify maximum speeds for specific trackage.</p>

      <p>When an Auto Active Train is created, a default <em>maximum
      allowed speed</em> is specified as a fraction of the allowable
      speed range. Each new speed value is compared to the
      <em>maximum allowed speed</em>, and reduced if necessary. This
      allows different Auto Active Trains to run at maximum speeds
      appropriate to the type of train, regardless of the speed
      capability of its locomotive. The <em>maximum allowed
      speed</em> may be changed while running by using the <strong>Set
      Maximum Speed</strong> Action. This provides for slowing down or
      speeding up at specified locations in the Transit, for
      example, when passing through a town.</p>

      <p>Since all locomotives do not run the same, when an Auto
      Active Train is created, a <strong>Loco Speed Compensation</strong> in the range
      of 50 to 150&#37; is specified. This Compensation factor multiplies all
      speed values immediately before the speed is sent to the
      throttle (after the speed has been tested against the
      <em>maximum allowed speed</em>). For "normally" running
      locomotives, a speed factor of 100&#37; is appropriate. For
      locomotives that run slower than "normal", use a factor
      greater than 100&#37; and for trains that run faster than
      "normal", a factor less than 100&#37; is best.</p>

      <p>Three different methods are provided currently for
      stopping an Auto Active Train when it needs to stop. If the
      Section has hardware stop Sensors, the train is halted when
      it reaches the Stop Sensor for its direction of travel. If no
      Stop Sensors are available for the Section, the train length
      is compared to the length of the Section to determine if the
      Auto Active Train will fit in the Section. If the Auto Active
      Train will fit in the Section, and if all cars of the train
      are detectable, the Auto Active Train is stopped when it
      exits the Section previous to the current Section. If neither
      of the two methods apply, the train is stopped when it enters
      the Section.<br>
      Stopping using a Stop Sensor is the most precise way to stop
      an Auto Active Train at a specific location. Stop Sensors
      need not be in place for all Sections, but their use for
      automatic station stops and passing tracks is strongly
      recommended.<br>
      For the second stopping method to work, train length must be
      entered, lengths of all Blocks in the Transit must be present
      in the Block Table, and the train must be fully detectable
      (this usually means all cars must have resistance wheels on
      one or more trucks). Block lengths should not include the
      turnouts at the ends of the Section, or portions of a Section
      not normally traversed by the Auto Active Train.</p>

      <h3>Requirements for Automatic Running</h3>

      <p>Automatic running of Active Trains requires the layout and
      the train have required hardware and that a fully configured
      Layout Editor panel be present to provide layout connectivity
      information. Some of the automatic running requirements are
      strongly recommended for manual running also. Requirements
      include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The layout must have a DCC command station that
          supports JMRI computer throttles.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The layout must be divided into Blocks, and each Block
          along the mainline must have occupancy detection
          hardware, providing occupancy Sensors to JMRI.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Turnouts (track switches) along the mainline must be
          switchable by the computer. It is recommended that
          turnouts have feedback, but feedback is not required.
          Automatic running of trains requires that the computer
          set turnouts for travel along the Transit as Sections are
          allocated. Automatic setting of turnouts is available as
          an option when running manually.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Blocks, turnouts, and signals must be configured on a
          Layout Editor panel that fully describes the connectivity
          of the layout. The Layout Editor panel need not be
          displayed, but must show up in the submenu of Panels/Show
          Panel. If multiple Layout Editor panels are present,
          Dispatcher will use the Layout Editor panel selected in
          Dispatcher <a href="Options.shtml">Options</a>.
          The Layout Editor panel acts
          as a connectivity database, supplying connectivity
          information as needed to Dispatcher or the Auto Active
          Train's <em>virtual engineer</em>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Auto Active Trains follow signals, requiring signals
          as part of the Layout Editor panel. Hardware signals on
          the layout need not be physically present, but signals
          and signal logic (Either SignalHeads &amp; SSL or
          SignalMasts &amp; SML) must be configured in the Layout
          Editor panel, and must be connected to the track at the
          proper block transition points.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Sections and Transits must be set up for the layout.
          This is also required for manual running of Active
          Trains. Sections must be configured so that Sections
          interconnect only once in each direction. This impacts
          the way Blocks are set up.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>All entry points and exit points from Sections in the
          Transit must have signals on the Layout Editor panel. If
          Using Signal Heads/SSL then boundaries between Blocks in
          Sections should be signaled on the Layout Editor panel.
          Portions of the layout that are not in Sections in
          Transits only need those signals that are necessary to
          allow setup of signal logic, either SSL (Simple Signal
          Logic) or SML (Signal Mast Logic) for signals in Sections
          of the Transit. <span class="since">since 3.3.5</span>
          Use of the Layout Editor tools to
          configure signals on the Layout Editor panel is required
          (this is how Layout Editor knows which signals apply to
          which turnout, block boundary, etc.). Use of these tools
          to set up signal logic is strongly recommended. When
          checking for direction sensors in signal logic,
          Dispatcher looks in the SSL of each signal head (see
          below). If signal logic is set up without use of the
          Layout Editor tools, make sure each SSL or SML is
          configured correctly.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>(SSL Only) All Sections must be configured with
          direction Sensors. When an Auto Active Train is created,
          Dispatcher will check that direction Sensors are present
          and are configured in signal logic of signals in all
          Sections of the Transit. Dispatcher will place direction
          Sensors in signal logic if they are not found.
          <strong>Note:</strong> Direction Sensors may be cleared from signal
          logic using a tool in the Section Table when not running
          automatic trains.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The lengths of Blocks on the physical layout should be
          entered in the Block Table to facilitate stopping Auto
          Active Trains.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Hardware stop sensors are not required in Sections,
          however, hardware stop sensors are strongly recommended
          in Sections where accurate stopping locations are
          desired.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Resistance wheels on all cars of an Auto Active Train
          are not required unless <strong>Auto Allocate</strong> and/or
          <strong>Auto Release</strong> are being used (applies to both
          manual and automatic running of trains). <strong>Resistance
          wheels on all cars are highly recommended</strong> for all
          Auto Active Trains. If they are not present, the
          <em>virtual engineer</em> has no way of knowing when the
          last car has exited a Block. Without the train being
          fully detectable along its entire length, the Auto Active
          Train will not stop at acceptable locations, and waiting
          trains may allocate and set turnouts before the
          undetectable train has passed.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Even if the above requirements are met, automatic running
      will not be successful unless the layout and the rolling
      stock are in very good condition. The track must be clean,
      and the wheels of automatically running trains must be very
      clean, allowing good block detection. Locomotives must run
      smoothly, especially at slower speeds. Derailing problems
      must have been solved. <strong>A train should run flawlessly in
      manual mode, before automatic running is attempted.</strong></p>

      <p>Because Auto Active Trains use JMRI signaling for stops,
      starts and speeds, the signaling should also be flawless,
      including all blocks, turnouts and direction indicators
      needed.</p>
