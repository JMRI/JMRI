      <h2>JMRI: USB Input Control</h2><a href=
      "TreeFrame.jpg"><img src="TreeFrame.jpg" align="right"
      height="132" width="325"></a> The USB Input Control window
      lets you connect JMRI sensors and memories to USB input
      devices on your computer. For example, you could have a JMRI
      sensor go ACTIVE when when you type a key or press a joystick
      button. You can then use <a href=
      "../../../../../html/tools/Routes.shtml">Routes</a> and
      <a href="../../../../../html/tools/Logix.shtml">Logix</a> to
      use that USB input to control your layout.

      <p>On the left side of the window is a tree displaying the
      available USB controllers and components within them.
      Depending on details of your computer, this tree might be
      completely populated when the window opens, or you might have
      to change the inputs (e.g. click a button) to have it show
      up. Devices that are plugged in after the program starts may
      or may not appear, depending on the specifics of your
      computer setup.</p>

      <p>When you select a single component in the left-hand tree
      display, the right side pane will show you the details of
      that component and it's current value.</p>

      <p>Below that is an area for configuring the program to drive
      a JMRI <a href=
      "../../../../../html/tools/Sensors.shtml">Sensor</a> and/or
      <a href="../../../../../html/tools/Memories.shtml">Memory</a>
      from the USB input. You can enter a Sensor name in the top
      text field, and then check the "Copy to JMRI Sensor" box.
      When the input goes On (for a digital input), or has a value
      greater than zero (for an analog input), the Sensor will be
      set to ACTIVE, and it will otherwise be set to INACTIVE. You
      can watch this work in the <a href=
      "../../../jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor
      Table</a>.</p>

      <p>Note that you can't edit the sensor name while the box is
      checked; you have to uncheck the box so the Sensor stops
      following the USB input before changing to a new Sensor
      Name.</p>

      <p>This feature was added on an experimental basis in JMRI
      2.1.5. In that version, your configuration information isn't
      restored after you quit and restart the program. That will be
      added in the next JMRI version.</p>
