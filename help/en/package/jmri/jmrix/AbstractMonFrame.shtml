      <h1>Communications Monitor Window</h1>JMRI provides a
      communications monitor window so you can see what's happening
      on the communications link between the program and the layout
      hardware.

      <p>Once you open a monitor window, it will automatically
      display all traffic on the link as long as "Filter Bytes" is
      blank.</p>

      <h2>Controls</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>Clear Screen</dt>

        <dd>Erases the log area at the top of the screen</dd>

        <dt>Freeze Screen</dt>

        <dd>Stops acquiring new information, so that the captured
        information stops scrolling up</dd>

        <dt>Show raw data</dt>

        <dd>Normally, the monitor displays the program's
        interpretation of what it's seeing. If you want to see the
        raw bytes, check this box.</dd>

        <dt>Show timestamps</dt>

        <dd>Normally, the program just displays the data from the
        communication link. If you'd like each message to be
        preceded by the time it was sent or received, check this
        box.</dd>

        <dt>Add message</dt>

        <dd>If you want to insert a message into the captured
        information, e.g. to make a note about what you're about to
        do, you can type it into the text field next to the "Add
        Message" button and then click that button. This is
        particularly useful when you're logging to a file (see
        below) and want to make a note for later about what's
        happening.</dd>

        <dt>Filter Bytes</dt>

        <dd>You can filter unwanted messages from the window by
        entering each message's first hex value into the "Filter
        Bytes" field. This can be especially helpful when there is
        a lot of routine comm traffic. Separate multiple values by
        spaces. e.g. "B0 D0 CC". This example will suppress any
        messages whose raw data starts with "B0", "D0" or "CC" You
        can determine the available hex values by turning on "Show
        raw data."</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Logging To A File</h2>Sometimes, it's helpful to capture
      what's happening. For example, you might encounter a bug
      (!!), and want to send a copy of what's happening to the
      people who are trying to fix it.

      <p>Small amounts of data can be copied from the log window
      with your computers "copy" command (e.g. ctrl-C or cmd-C),
      and then pasted into an email.</p>

      <p>If you want to capture more, you can have the window write
      a log file on your computer's disk. To do this:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Click "Choose log file". A file-chooser window will
        open. Navigate to where you want to store the file, enter a
        name for the new log file, and click "Save". Note that if
        you pick a file that already exists, it will be
        overwritten.</li>

        <li>When you're ready to capture the data you want, click
        "Start logging" on the monitor window.</li>

        <li>When you're done, click "Stop logging" to store the
        data and close the file.</li>
      </ol>
