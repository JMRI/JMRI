      <h1>JMRI: ECoS Preferences</h1>
      The ECoS User Preferences allows you to control the way
      that the ECoS interacts with JMRI for different features:

      <h2>Roster</h2>
      <b>Add Locos to the ECoS</b><br>
      When a new roster entry is created in JMRI, this option
      allows you to set whether the loco should be added to the
      ECoS.

      <p><b>Remove Locos from the ECoS</b>
        <br>
      When a roster entry is deleted in JMRI, this option allows
      you to set whether the loco should be deleted from the ECoS
      or not.</p>

      <p><b>Add Locos to JMRI Roster</b><br>
      When JMRI detects that a new loco has been added in the ECoS
      Database, this option allows you to set whether the loco
      should be added into the roster or not.</p>

      <p><b>Remove Locos from JMRI Roster</b><br>
      When JMRI detect that a loco has been removed from the ECoS
      Database, this option allows you to set whether the loco
      should be deleted from the roster or not. Note: Currently if
      a loco has been removed from the ECoS when it is not
      connected to JMRI, this removal is not detected.</p>

      <p><b>ECoS Loco Description Template</b><br>
      Enter a combination of plain text and one or more of the
      special field-codes shown below this field to use as a template
      for display of Loco information.</p>

      <h2>Throttle</h2><b>Temporary Locos</b><br>
      The ECoS requires an entry in its database before it is
      possible to control a loco. When you select either a roster
      entry or enter in an address of loco in the address box of a
      throttle and that addresses doesn't already exist in the ECoS
      database, JMRI will automatically create an entry to match
      with a description of "Created By JMRI". When JMRI is
      shutdown, these temporary locos can either be left on the
      ECoS or removed. This setting allows you set how this works.

      <p><b>Loss of Control</b><br>
      If another controller has exclusive control over a loco, then
      it is not possible for JMRI to take control or operate that
      loco. JMRI will make three attempts at trying to gain over
      the loco, if the third attempt fails, the user will be
      presented with a prompt on whether to force control over
      loco. Here you can set whether to always force a controlled
      take over, never force a controlled take over or to always
      prompt.</p>

      <h2>Turnouts</h2><b>Remove Turnouts from the ECoS</b><br>
      If a turnout is removed from the turnout table in JMRI, this
      determines whether the turnout should be deleted from the
      ECoS.

      <p><b>Add Turnouts to JMRI</b><br>
      If JMRI receives a notification that a turnout or accessory
      has been added to the ECoS while JMRI is running, this
      setting determines how JMRI should react.<br>
      Note: That this does not prevent JMRI from populating the
      turnout table when the application is first opened.</p>

      <p><b>Remove Turnouts from JMRI</b><br>
      If JMRI receives a notification that a turnout or accessory
      has been removed from the ECoS, this setting determines how
      JMRI should react.</p>
