      <h1>JMRI: ECoS Preferences</h1>
      The ECoS User Preferences allows you to control the way that the ECoS interacts with JMRI for
      different features:
      <h2>Roster</h2>
      <strong>Add Locos to the ECoS</strong><br>
      When a new roster entry is created in JMRI, this option allows you to set whether the loco
      should be added to the ECoS.
      <p><strong>Remove Locos from the ECoS</strong><br>
      When a roster entry is deleted in JMRI, this option allows you to set whether the loco should
      be deleted from the ECoS or not.</p>

      <p><strong>Add Locos to JMRI Roster</strong><br>
      When JMRI detects that a new loco has been added in the ECoS Database, this option allows you
      to set whether the loco should be added into the roster or not.</p>

      <p><strong>Remove Locos from JMRI Roster</strong><br>
      When JMRI detect that a loco has been removed from the ECoS Database, this option allows you
      to set whether the loco should be deleted from the roster or not. Note: Currently if a loco
      has been removed from the ECoS when it is not connected to JMRI, this removal is not
      detected.</p>

      <p><strong>ECoS Loco Description Template</strong><br>
      Enter a combination of plain text and one or more of the special field-codes shown below this
      field to use as a template for display of Loco information.</p>

      <h2>Throttle</h2>
      <strong>Temporary Locos</strong><br>
      The ECoS requires an entry in its database before it is possible to control a loco. When you
      select either a roster entry or enter in an address of loco in the address box of a throttle
      and that addresses doesn't already exist in the ECoS database, JMRI will automatically create
      an entry to match with a description of "Created By JMRI". When JMRI is shutdown, these
      temporary locos can either be left on the ECoS or removed. This setting allows you set how
      this works.
      <p><strong>Loss of Control</strong><br>
      If another controller has exclusive control over a loco, then it is not possible for JMRI to
      take control or operate that loco. JMRI will make three attempts at trying to gain over the
      loco, if the third attempt fails, the user will be presented with a prompt on whether to
      force control over loco. Here you can set whether to always force a controlled take over,
      never force a controlled take over or to always prompt.</p>

      <h2>Turnouts</h2>
      <strong>Remove Turnouts from the ECoS</strong><br>
      If a turnout is removed from the turnout table in JMRI, this determines whether the turnout
      should be deleted from the ECoS.
      <p><strong>Add Turnouts to JMRI</strong><br>
      If JMRI receives a notification that a turnout or accessory has been added to the ECoS while
      JMRI is running, this setting determines how JMRI should react.<br>
      Note: That this does not prevent JMRI from populating the turnout table when the application
      is first opened.</p>

      <p><strong>Remove Turnouts from JMRI</strong><br>
      If JMRI receives a notification that a turnout or accessory has been removed from the ECoS,
      this setting determines how JMRI should react.</p>
