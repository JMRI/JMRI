      <h1>Configure Grapevine Nodes</h1>This is the
      help/jmri/jmrix/grapevine/nodetable/NodeTableFrame help page

      <p>The "Node Table" tool lets you see all your nodes at once.
      Each line in the table corresponds to one node address. The
      columns are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Address</dt>

        <dd>The node number</dd>

        <dt>Status</dt>

        <dd>
          The current status of this node.

          <dl>
            <dt>Configured</dt>

            <dd>This node has been configured in JMRI. You can talk
            to its Turnouts, SignalHeads, Sensors, etc.</dd>

            <dt>Present</dt>

            <dd>This node has been detected on the Grapevine, but
            it you need to configure it before you can access it in
            the program.</dd>

            <dt>(blank)</dt>

            <dd>The node is not configured, and has not been seen
            on the Grapevine.</dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>

        <dt>Add/Edit</dt>

        <dd>The third column provides a button for you to add a
        missing node or edit the configuration of an existing node.
        If you do add or edit a node, remember to save your
        preferences again!</dd>

        <dt>Init</dt>

        <dd>If the node is configured, there's a button in the 4th
        column that lets you send the initialization messages to
        the node. This is useful if e.g. the node has been turned
        off and on, so needs to be reinitialized. This is only
        available for configured nodes.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>At the bottom of the window is a "Check" button and a
      status field. Click "Check" to scan the Grapevine to check
      its status and locate nodes. The status field is:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Starting</dt>

        <dd>A scan is starting, but no reply has been heard from
        the Grapevine yet.</dd>

        <dt>Checking</dt>

        <dd>Scan in progress, and the Grapevine seems to be
        working.</dd>

        <dt>OK</dt>

        <dd>Scan completed OK.</dd>

        <dt>Grapevine failed</dt>

        <dd>Scan completed without hearing anything from the
        Grapevine. Perhaps the cable isn't completely connected, or
        some piece isn't powered up.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>There's also a "Change Node Board Address" button, which
      can be used to change the address of a Grapevine node. It
      opens a <a href="RenumberFrame.shtml">new window</a>.</p>
