      <h1>Edit NCE Consist</h1>This tool allows you to review,
      edit, and save NCE style consists. It also allows you to
      backup and restore all the NCE command station consists to
      and from a file. The file format is identical to NCE, so you
      can restore a file that was generated by the NCE backup
      command. Very useful since the restore and backup commands in
      the 2007 EPROM don't currently work! We recommend that you
      set the baud rate at 9600 when using this tool.

      <p>There is also a separate JMRI <a href=
      "../../../../../html/tools/consisttool/ConsistTool.shtml">generic
      consist tool</a>, whose <a href=
      "../../../../../html/tools/consisttool/ConsistTool.shtml">help
      page</a> also has a small tutorial on the various forms of
      consisting.</p>

      <h2>Backup</h2>To backup all of your consists to a file,
      press the "Backup" button located on the bottom row of the
      JMRI consist editor. A default file name will appear in the
      Save window, you can change the name it to whatever you wish.
      Press the "Save" button and the JMRI consist editor will read
      the NCE command station memory and store the contents into
      the file you selected.

      <h2>Restore</h2>To restore all of your consists from a file,
      press the "Restore" button located on the bottom row of the
      JMRI consist editor. Select a file by typing the name, or
      clicking on it. Press the "Open" button and the JMRI consist
      editor will write the NCE command station memory with the
      contents of the file you selected. The JMRI consist editor
      will check the contents of the file before writing the
      command station memory to verify that the file is indeed a
      NCE consist backup file! Note that the "Restore" only updates
      the NCE command station memory. It doesn't program the locos
      on your layout.

      <h2>Get</h2>To review a consist, enter the number of the
      consist in the text box under the heading "Consist" and press
      the "Get" button. This will retrieve the consist from the
      command station's memory.

      <h2>Add Loco</h2>To add a loco to a consist, enter the loco's
      address and then press the "??" button until the desired
      direction "Forward" or "Reverse" appears. If you want the use
      the short address format press the "Long" button and "Short"
      should appear. To program the loco with the consist address
      and update the NCE command station, press the "Add" button
      and the loco will be added to the consist.

      <h2>Add Loco from Roster</h2>To add a loco from your
      locomotive roster, select the desired loco and the program
      will automatically fill in the loco address and address
      format. Select the loco direction and press "Add" to complete
      the operation.

      <h2>Replace</h2>To replace the lead or rear loco, press the
      "Replace" button. This will delete the selected loco from the
      consist. Enter the address of the new loco along with its
      direction and press "Add" to program this loco with the
      consist address. If you want a mid loco to now be a lead or
      rear loco, just enter the mid loco's address and then press
      "Add".

      <h2>Delete</h2>To delete an loco from the consist, press the
      "Delete" button across from the loco address you wish to
      remove.

      <h2>Clear</h2>To remove all locos from a consist, press the
      "Clear" button located on the bottom row.

      <h2>Previous and Next</h2>The "Previous" and "Next" buttons
      allow you to search for consists. If you're looking for an
      empty consist, click the "Empty Consist" box located in the
      upper right hand corner.

      <h2>Verify Loco Checkbox</h2>When checked, the program will
      verify that the loco that you are adding isn't assigned as a
      lead or rear loco in another consist. It takes several
      seconds for the program to verify that the add loco is
      available. An error message will appear if the program
      determines that the add loco address is already in use.

      <p>However, if the add loco was previously assigned as mid
      loco loco in another consist, the program will delete the
      loco from the other consist and add it to the new one without
      any warnings.</p>

      <h2>Consist Roster Checkbox</h2>When checked, the program
      will create and manage a roster of consists. A consist must
      have a lead and rear loco before the program will create an
      entry for you to manage. Two additional buttons will appear
      when the "Consist roster" checkbox is selected, "Save" and
      "Delete", and the "Consist" pull down menu becomes enabled.
      If you already have a NCE consist that you want to add to the
      consist roster, simply press the "Clear" button when the
      "Consist roster" checkbox is selected and the program will
      ask you if you want to add the NCE consist to your roster. If
      you pressed "yes", the "Consist" menu should then have a new
      entry which is the address of the lead loco of your consist.
      To load your consist back into NCE memory and reprogram your
      locos, simply select the consist from the "Consist" menu and
      press "Load". If you don't want to load the consist, press
      "Cancel".

      <p>There isn't a limit to the number of consist that the
      consist roster can manage. This means those of you that are
      lucky enough to have more than 127 consists can use the NCE
      Consist editor to manage an "unlimited" number of
      consists.</p>

      <p>When managing a large number of consist, it might be
      useful to identify your consists by assigning the lowest
      number of your end locos as the lead loco. This way you can
      quickly select a consist by using the lowest number of your
      two end locos.</p>

      <h2>Save and Load button</h2>The label for this button can be
      "Save" or "Load". If the program detects that a consist has
      been created or changed the "Save" button will become
      enabled. The program will enable the "Save" button when
      there's at least a lead and rear loco and the direction for
      each has been selected.

      <p>When you select a consist to load from the "Consist" menu,
      the "Save" button becomes "Load". You must specify the loco's
      direction to enable the "Load" button. You can also modify
      the consist before loading it and the program will ask if you
      want to save the changes. When loading a consist the program
      will search for the first empty consist number in the NCE
      command station starting at consist number 127. If you select
      a consist from the "Consist" menu that is already in the NCE
      command station, the program will pop up a message stating
      that the consist has already been loaded. You can press
      "Load" to reprogram your locos if you wish, otherwise press
      the "Cancel" button.</p>

      <h2>Delete button</h2>To remove a consist from your roster,
      press the "Delete" button located on the bottom row. The
      "Delete button only becomes active after you've selected a
      consist from the "Consist" menu.

      <h2>Status:</h2>There are many states that the NCE consist
      editor can be in and the "Status:" field provides an
      indication of what is happening and whether the operation was
      successful. Listed below is a brief description of the
      various "Status:" states.

      <dl>
        <dt>okay</dt>

        <dd>Operation completed successfully.</dd>

        <dt>error</dt>

        <dd>Operation failed. A popup error message should also
        appear.</dd>

        <dt>waiting</dt>

        <dd>The editor is waiting for the NCE command station to
        respond. The NCE command station should respond within a
        couple of seconds, otherwise there's a problem with the
        connection or command station.</dd>

        <dt>searching</dt>

        <dd>The editor is reading the NCE command station for the
        desired information. Normally the state after pressing
        "Previous" or "Next". Also when loading a consist from the
        roster the editor will search the NCE command station
        memory for an empty consist number to assign to the
        consist. Searches should complete in a few seconds,
        otherwise there's a problem with the connection or command
        station.</dd>

        <dt>none</dt>

        <dd>The editor wasn't able to find a consist or an empty
        consist.</dd>

        <dt>verifying</dt>

        <dd>The editor is reading the NCE command station memory to
        see if a loco has already been assigned as a lead or rear
        loco in a consist. If a loco is already assigned, a popup
        message will appear and "Status:" will show "error".</dd>

        <dt>unknown</dt>

        <dd>The initial state of the NCE consist editor. Also when
        the "Consist roster" checkbox is selected means that the
        consist in the NCE command station wasn't created by the
        editor. Therefore the editor doesn't know the direction of
        the locos in the consists.</dd>

        <dt>Modified!</dt>

        <dd>The editor knows about the consist, but the consist has
        been modified. If a loco has been added, the direction of
        the loco isn't known. And if a loco has been deleted from
        the consist, the editor wants you to know!</dd>
