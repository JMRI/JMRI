      <h1>Edit NCE Macro</h1>This tool allows you to review, edit,
      and save NCE style macros. It also allows you to backup and
      restore all the NCE command station macros to and from a
      file. The file format is identical to NCE, so you can restore
      a file that was generated by the NCE backup command. Very
      useful since the restore and backup commands in the 2007
      EPROM don't currently work! We recommend that you set the
      baud rate at 9600 when using this tool.

      <h2>Backup</h2>To backup all of your macros to a file, press
      the "Backup" button located on the bottom row of the JMRI
      macro editor. A default file name will appear in the Save
      window, you can change the name it to whatever you wish.
      Press the "Save" button and the JMRI macro editor will read
      the NCE command station memory and store the contents into
      the file you selected.

      <h2>Restore</h2>To restore all of your macros from a file,
      press the "Restore" button located on the bottom row of the
      JMRI macro editor. Select a file by typing the name, or
      clicking on it. Press the "Open" button and the JMRI macro
      editor will write the NCE command station memory with the
      contents of the file you selected. The JMRI macro editor will
      check the contents of the file before writing the command
      station memory to verify that the file is indeed a NCE macro
      backup file!

      <h2>Get</h2>To review a macro, enter the number of the macro
      in the text box under the heading "Macro" and press the "Get"
      button. This will retrieve the macro from the command
      station's memory. If there's currently a macro, the "Reply:"
      will be "macro found". If the macro doesn't exist, the
      "Reply:" will be "macro empty". If there is a macro, the JMRI
      NCE editor will show a list of accessories that the macro is
      programmed to activate.

      <p>To change an accessory address, type in a new accessory
      address and press the button next to the accessory address
      box to "Closed" or "Thrown". If you want to save it to the
      NCE command station you must press the "Save" button located
      at the bottom of the editor. The "Save" button only becomes
      active if the macro has been modified.</p>

      <h2>Add</h2>To add an accessory to a macro, enter the
      accessory's address and then press the "Add" button until the
      desired action "Thrown" or "Closed" appears. Again, use the
      "Save" button if you wish to update the NCE command station
      memory.

      <h2>Delete</h2>To delete an accessory, push the "Delete"
      button across from the accessory you wish to delete. And
      "Save" if you want to update the NCE command station memory.

      <h2>Link macro</h2>To link this macro to another one, enter
      the macro that you want to link to in the last text box of
      the JMRI NCE editor. Press the "Link macro" button and "Save"
      if you want to update the NCE command station memory. To
      delete the link, press "Delete" and "Save".

      <h2>Previous and Next</h2>The "Previous" and "Next" buttons
      allow you to search for macros. If you're looking for an
      empty macro, click the "Empty Macro" box located in the upper
      right hand corner. And finally, if you're a diehard NCE fan
      and just can't stand using the terms "Thrown" and "Closed" to
      describe a turnout, click the "NCE Turnout" box and the
      accessory buttons will become "Normal" and "Reverse" just
      like your NCE throttle! <!--#include virtual="/Footer" -->
