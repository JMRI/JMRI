      <h1>NCE USB Interface Tool</h1>

      <p>This tool will change options in the NCE USB interface.
      Currently this only sets the cab id of the USB interface.</p>

      <p>The valid range of cab id values for the USB Interface
      vary depending the command station, software version in the
      command station, and version of the firmware in the USB
      interface.</p>

      <p>This tool used to (prior to 4.1.1) try to find the current
      USB cab id, but the method was imperfect and did not allow
      for resetting the id when the cab id was not vaild for the
      system it was plugged into.</p>
