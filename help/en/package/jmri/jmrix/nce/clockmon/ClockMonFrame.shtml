      <h1>NCE Fast Clock</h1>

      <p>The NCE fast clock can be either a source of fast time or can be commanded to follow the
      internal clock. The best synchronization is when the NCE clock is the master source. It works
      by adjusting the internal clock ratio so the fast minutes will be the same. The provides for
      the clocks to be basically in sync all the time. Adjustments are made about every 20 fast
      seconds.</p>

      <p>You may also have the internal clock drive the NCE fast clock. However, this requires some
      number of seconds to be added or skipped in the NCE fast clock so the minutes will roll over
      at the same time. That minute roll over is critical for the NCE as that is when the time is
      sent to all the Pro cabs. Due to limited adjustments in the NCE fast clock this method causes
      the clock to run fast for part of the minute and slow for the other part of the minute so the
      minute roll over is correct.</p>

      <h1>NCE Clock Monitor</h1>

      <p>When running in the NCE as clock master mode, the internal clock rate is adjusted to match
      time with the NCE command station clock. The goal is the minute should roll over at the same
      time for the internal clock and ProCab displays should change the same as clocks on PanelPro
      etc....</p>

      <p>When running with the internal clock as master, the NCE clock is adjusted, forward or
      backwards, some number of seconds just before the minute rolls over. So NCE time does jump
      slightly as time is adjusted but the goal is the minutes tick off at the same time as the
      internal clock.</p>

      <p>This service depends on being able to do memory read and write commands to the command
      station. This is currently supported by the serial connection on the command stations only.
      Those devices that rely on the NCE-USB adapter, like the PowerCab or SB3, are not currently
      supported due to lack of command station memory access.</p>

      <h2>Clock Status Lines</h2>

      <p>These lines display current status of each clock and settings. When running in sync mode,
      the line that is the master will be so marked. Also the current error between the NCE and
      internal clock will be displayed.</p>

      <h2>Clock Settings</h2>

      <p>These are the same as making changes from the ProCab throttle. If the sync mode is
      'Internal Master' these are disabled and you have to make your changes via the internal clock
      control panel.</p>

      <p>Changing clock settings while in sync mode will cause the sync mode to reset and perform
      initialization for that sync mode.</p>

      <h2>Polling Speed</h2>

      <p>This sets how often a clock read is made just for the purpose of updating the clock
      monitor display. Setting this low will increase the serial traffic to the command station.
      But setting this high will also cause the clock status display to lag considerable and the
      indicated 'error' will tend to look worse but that is cosmetic only.</p>

      <h2>PID Constants</h2>

      <p>These values should generally be left alone. They adjust how the calculations are handled
      to keep the NCE and internal clock in sync. It was a very loose 'PID' type calculation.
      Generally the clock sync will improve as it is allowed to run. The first few minutes may hunt
      around while finding the best adjustments.</p>

      <h3>P Factor</h3>

      <p>This adjusts how much the current error is used to adjust the clocks.</p>

      <h3>I Factor</h3>

      <p>This adjusts how much the difference between the current error and prior error is used in
      the clock adjustments.</p>

      <h3>D Factor</h3>

      <p>This adjusts how much the rate of change between the current error and the prior error is
      used in adjusting the clock.</p>
