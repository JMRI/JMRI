      <h1>NCE Cab Monitor</h1>

      <p>This tool will show what each cab device is doing. It can identify the type of cab, AIU,
      and other device.</p>

      <p>You must press the refresh button for it to pull the status from the command station. It
      takes about 10 seconds to poll all 64 addresses in the CS02, this lower speed is to insure it
      doesn't interfere with other commands being processed.</p>

      <p>The purge button will remove a cab id from the 'active' polling list. This will reduce the
      frequency that the cab is polled which will improve the response speed of the other active
      cabs. Generally this only helps larger club type layouts with many active cabs.</p>
