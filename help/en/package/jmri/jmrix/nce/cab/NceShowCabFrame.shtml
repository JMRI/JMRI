      <h1>NCE Cab Monitor</h1>

      <p>This tool will show what each cab device is doing. It can
      identify the type of cab, AIU, and other device.</p>

      <p>You must press the refresh button for it to pull the
      status from the command station. It takes about 10 seconds to
      poll all 64 addresses in the CS02, this lower speed is to
      insure it doesn't interfere with other commands being
      processed.</p>

      <p>The purge button will remove a cab id from the 'active'
      polling list. This will reduce the frequency that the cab is
      polled which will improve the response speed of the other
      active cabs. Generally this only helps larger club type
      layouts with many active cabs.</p>
