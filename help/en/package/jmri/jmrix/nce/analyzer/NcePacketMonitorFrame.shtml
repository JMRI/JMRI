The NCE DCC Packet Analyzer tool works with the
<a href="http://www.ncedcc.com/component/virtuemart/?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=67&category_id=8">NCE Packet Analyzer<a/>
product to read and present the DCC packets on your track.
It connects via a separate serial port from your 
command station connection.

<h2>Using the Analyzer</h2>
Select the "Serial port:" and push the "Open" button before using any of
the radio buttons. The baud rate is fixed at 38.4Kbps. Press the "Init"
button to initialize the analyzer.

<P>The "+ on" checkbox allows you to suppress identical packets.
Each time the JMRI program detects a packet that it identical to the
previous it will replace the packet with a "+" character. Warning, the
JMRI program will only display the suppressed packets ("+" characters)
after receiving a packet that isn't identical to the previous. If
there's little activity it is recommended that you not use the suppress
feature. This way you will immediately see all packets being captured by
the analyzer.</P>

<P>Use the radio buttons to configure the analyzer to your liking.
Note that the NCE analyzer will remember the configuration when it is
powered down.</P>

contents. The display is cryptic but understandable. Unless stated
otherwise all numbers are displayed in decimal. Any packet that isn't
understood by the analyzer will be displayed in hex.
