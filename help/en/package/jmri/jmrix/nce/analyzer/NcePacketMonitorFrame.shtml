            <p>The NCE DCC Packet Analyzer tool works with the <a href=
            "https://ncedcc.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200979515-Packet-Analyzer" target=
            "_blank">NCE Packet Analyzer</a> product to read and present the DCC packets on your
            track. It connects via a separate serial port from your command station connection.</p>

            <p>If you do not have an NCE system, configure a new second connection in <a href=
            "/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/Start_Preferences.shtml#Connections" target=
            "_blank">Preferences-&gt;Connections</a> to "NCE Simulator" so you can access the NCE
            "DCC Packet Analyzer" menu item. If you do this, you will need to restart JMRI and then
            open <a href="/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/Start_Preferences.shtml#Defaults" target=
            "_blank">Preferences-&gt;Defaults</a> to check that the NCE Simulator has not "stolen"
            any of your real connections.</p>

      <h2>Using the Analyzer</h2>
      Select the "Serial port:" and push the "Open" button before using any of the radio buttons.
      The baud rate is fixed at 38.4Kbps. If nothing appears on the screen immediately, select a
      new display mode (e.g. "Verbose") and some packet types to display (e.g. "Idle Packets").
      <p>Use the radio buttons to configure the analyzer to your liking. Note that the NCE analyzer
      will remember the configuration when it is powered down.</p>

      <p>The "+ on" checkbox allows you to suppress identical packets. Each time the JMRI program
      detects a packet that it identical to the previous it will replace the packet with a "+"
      character. Warning, the JMRI program will only display the suppressed packets ("+"
      characters) after receiving a packet that isn't identical to the previous. If there's little
      activity it is recommended that you not use the suppress feature. This way you will
      immediately see all packets being captured by the analyzer.</p>

      <p>The "Info" button will cause the analyzer to display its inbuilt help screen and the
      Analyzer version number. Press the "Res." button to resume normal operation.</p>

      <h2>Hex mode displays:</h2>
      <strong>H0 mode (compatible with the ICC analyzer):</strong><br>
      Displays packets in hex mode preceded by one character indicating how many start bits in the
      packet preamble. There are no spaces between any characters or bytes.<br>
      Example: $03686B<br>
      Description: 14 start bits with three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68, 0x6B
      <p><strong>H1 mode:</strong><br>
      Same as H0 mode except spaces will delimit preamble char and each pair of hex characters.<br>
      Example: $ 03 68 6B<br>
      14 start bits with three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68, 0x6B</p>

      <p><strong>H2 mode:</strong><br>
      Displays packets in hex mode with no indication of how many preamble bits. There are no
      spaces between any characters or bytes.<br>
      Example: 03686B<br>
      Three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68, 0x6B</p>

      <p><strong>H3 mode:</strong><br>
      Same as H2 mode except spaces will delimit each pair of hex characters<br>
      Example: 03 68 6B<br>
      Three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68, 0x6B</p>

      <p><strong>H4 mode:</strong><br>
      Displays packets in hex mode preceded by Pxx where xx indicates how many preamble bits (in
      hex). There are no spaces between any characters or bytes.<br>
      Example: P0E03686B<br>
      14 start bits with three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68, 0x6B</p>

      <p><strong>H5 mode:</strong><br>
      Same as H4 mode except spaces will delimit preamble chars and each pair of hex characters<br>
      Example: P0E 03 68 6B<br>
      14 start bits with three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68, 0x6B</p>

      <p><strong>H6 mode:</strong><br>
      Displays packets in hex mode with no indication of how many preamble bits but preceded by the
      letter P. There are no spaces between any characters or bytes.<br>
      Example: P03686B<br>
      Three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68, 0x6B</p>

      <p><strong>H7 mode:</strong><br>

      Three byte packet following with bytes of 0x03, 0x68, 0x6B</p>

      <h2>Verbose mode displays:</h2>
      Verbose mode displays are intended to allow humans to interpret packet contents. The display
      is cryptic but understandable. Unless stated otherwise all numbers are displayed in decimal.
      Any packet that isn't understood by the analyzer will be displayed in hex.
      <p>Reset packets will be displayed as: "RESET"</p>

      <p>Idle packets are displayed as: "IDLE"</p>
