      <h1>SDF Sound File Editor</h1>
      <p>Digitrax sound decoders are
      loaded with "sound projects", stored in "Sound Project"
      (.spj) files. Those contain a number of "sound fragments" in
      .wav format, plus a small program that tells the decoder when
      to play the various sounds, and controls the use of functions
      and CVs. That program is stored in a "Sound Definition" (SDF)
      format.</p>

      <p>The SDF Sound File Editor allows you to make certain kinds
      of changes to the SDF information in a sound project. It's
      used with the <a href="../soundloader/EditorFrame.shtml">SPJ
      editor</a> because the SDF information is stored in a
      Digitrax SPJ sound project file. After you edit the SDF
      information, you can save it to a file from the <a href=
      "../soundloader/EditorFrame.shtml">SPJ editor</a>, and then
      download it to a Digitrax sound decoder with a Digitrax PR2
      or PR3 and the <a href=
      "../soundloader/LoaderFrame.shtml">JMRI sound downloader
      tool</a> or the Digitrax SoundLoader program.</p>

      <p>Digitrax provides sample sound project files at their
      Sound Depot <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/sounddepot.php">(http://www.digitrax.com/sounddepot.php)</a>
      web site. You can also find links to documentation and
      additional tools there.</p>

      <p>When you open the SDF editor by clicking the "Edit" button
      in the <a href="../soundloader/EditorFrame.shtml">SPJ
      editor</a>, a new window opens that has two parts:<br>
      <a href="SdfInitSound.gif"><img src="SdfInitSound.gif" width=
      "415" height="235" alt="SDF Editor"></a><br>
      On the left is a view of the entire SDF information as a tree
      of nested elements. On the right is a window that shows
      additional information on the element that's selected on the
      left.</p>

      <p>The right hand window has the "assembly" format for the
      selected element at the top, then an explanation of what the
      element does in the middle. If an editor for that particular
      type of element has been defined, the section at the bottom
      will have checkboxes and selection boxes for modifying the
      content of the element.</p>

      <h2>SDF Structure</h2>Sound definitions define a series of
      layers that together control the decoder. By opening and
      closing the icons on the left side of the editor window, you
      can explore the structure of a sound definition. Feel free to
      explore! Until you save the file, you can't actually hurt
      anything.

      <h3>Scheme</h3>At the top level are "schemes", which are like
      programs for the decoder. A decoder can only be using one
      scheme at a time, although there can be several present in
      memory at once. The schemes are numbered, starting with 0,
      and the active scheme is selected via the contents of CV.
      Scheme 31 marks the end of the file.

      <p>There are no options to the scheme itself for you to edit,
      but you can open the scheme to work with its contents.</p>

      <p>The first element of a scheme is a version number tag.
      These defines the format used to store the scheme's contents.
      Currently, only version 1 is a defined format.</p>

      <p>After the version tag, one or more "channels" are
      defined.</p>

      <h3>Channel</h3>The decoder hardware is capable of handling
      several things at once. These are called "channels", and one
      or more of them make up each scheme. How many there can be
      depends on the specific decoder hardware, but it's quite
      common to see four channels within a scheme.

      <p>Although all the channels can be playing sounds
      simultaneously, each channel can only play one sound (one
      .wav fragment) at a time. The purpose of the commands within
      the channel is to define which sounds it should play, and
      when they should start and end.</p>

      <p>The channel element itself has no options for you to edit,
      but you can open it and work with its contents.</p>

      <h3>Sequence</h3>Within each channel, there can be one or
      more sequences. Each one has a condition under which it
      starts, and then a series of operations to take then it's
      started.

      <p>The operations can be things like starting to play a
      particular sound, or modifying how a sound is played, or
      changing various information internal to the decoder. When
      the sequence is started, it runs right to the end, leaving
      behind things for the decoder to do in the future. For
      example, it can define which sound fragment to play next when
      the current one is done, or stop the sound that's currently
      being played by the channel and start a new one.</p>

      <p>The sequence starts when a trigger condition becomes true.
      You can examine and change the trigger condition using the
      lower-right part of the editor frame. Some examples
      include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Trigger when a function becomes true, e.g. when the
        user sets F1 on.</li>

        <li>Trigger on how the decoder is controlling the
        locomotive, for example:

          <ul>
            <li>when the motor speed increases</li>

            <li>when the motor direction changes</li>

            <li>when the motor starts moving</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Trigger on other events from the outside, such as:

          <ul>
            <li>when the chuff cam goes active</li>

            <li>when a CV is written in ops mode</li>

            <li>when an input connection goes active</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>There are a lot of possibilities, which are listed in
      the selection box and (partially) documented on a <a href=
      "TriggerConditions.shtml">separate page</a>.

      <p>There are also four options that can be selected to change
      when the sequense is started:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Zap</dt>

        <dt>Run while triggered</dt>

        <dt>No preemptive trigger</dt>

        <dt>Not triggered</dt>

        <dd>The sequence starts when the opposite condition
        happens. For example, if the trigger is "When F1 goes
        active", and this option is selected, the sequence will
        start when F1 goes inactive.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Each sequence contains one or more instructions, the last
      of which has to be an "End Sequence" instruction.</p>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>Within each sequence are instructions
      that tell the decoder what to do as it's processing the
      sequence. We describe the most important ones here.

      <h4>Set Modifier</h4>

      <h2>Status and Future Work</h2><img src=
      "../../../../../images/bangdesk.gif" align="right" height=
      "45" width="45" alt="Cute image of work"> This editor tool is
      still very much a work in progress. It's good at browsing the
      content of the file, but it needs a lot more explanatory text
      added. Also, it currently only provides a way to make small
      changes to the contents of an SDF file, but doesn't (yet)
      allow you to make larger changes to structure of the file.
      For example, if you selected an "Initiate Sound" element,
      which tells the decoder to start playing a sound under
      certain conditions, you can change those conditions. But the
      editor (at present) doesn't provide a way to add new
      "Initiate Sound" elements.

      <p>The editor is meant to be a beginner's tool, and we need a
      lot of explanatory text on each window so people know what
      the options do.</p>
