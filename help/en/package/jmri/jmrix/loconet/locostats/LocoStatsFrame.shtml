      <h1>LocoNet Statistics</h1>
      <p>Advanced LocoNet interfaces like
      the LocoBuffer series from RR-CirKits or the PRn series from
      DIgitrax collect statistics on the operation of the attached
      LocoNet. This window displays those.</p>

      <p>The "Update" button requests information from the
      interface for display.</p>

      <h2>LocoBuffer Values</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>Version</dt>

        <dd>The version number of the unit.</dd>

        <dt>Breaks</dt>

        <dd>The number of LocoNet breaks seen since the last time
        the interface was powered on. This is the number of times
        that the locobuffer sees a problem with its output message
        to the loconet and issues a break, that tells the devices
        that are receiving the data to throw that packet away and
        the locobuffer then resends the packet.</dd>

        <dt>Errors</dt>

        <dd>The number of LocoNet errors seen since the last time
        the interface was powered on. This happens when the
        Locobuffer detects a problem on a packet it is receiving
        off the loconet. This should be a result of the sending
        device seeing a problem with the packet it is sending and
        issuing a break. The data is not lost when this happens,
        the sending device then sends the packet again. The worst
        case is if the Locobuffer seeing a problem with a packet it
        is receving and the transfitting device does not. The
        packet is then lost.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Digitrax PRn</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>Serial Number</dt>

        <dd>The serial number of the unit.</dd>

        <dt>PR2 Status</dt>

        <dd>The status bits from an interface in PR2 (programmer)
        mode.</dd>

        <dt>Current</dt>

        <dd>The current being drawn by the track, in some arbitrary
        units.</dd>

        <dt>Hardware Version</dt>

        <dd>The version number of the interface's hardware.</dd>

        <dt>Software Version</dt>

        <dd>The version number of the interface's software.</dd>

        <dt>Good Message Count</dt>

        <dd>The number of good LocoNet messages seen since the last
        time the interface was powered on.</dd>

        <dt>Bad Message Count</dt>

        <dd>The number of bad LocoNet messages seen since the last
        time the interface was powered on.</dd>

        <dt>MS100 Status</dt>

        <dd>The status bits from an interface in MS100 (LocoNet
        adapter) mode.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Some of these are displayed when the interface is acting
      as a programmer (PR2 mode), and others when it's acting as an
      interface (MS100 mode).</p>
