      <h1>Configure LocoNet ID Tool</h1>

      <h2>What is LocoNet ID?</h2>

      <p>The "LocoNet ID" is a number which is used by throttles
      and UR90, UR91, UR92, and UR92CE devices when a throttle is
      operating in a tetherless mode using infrared or simplex
      radio communications. When receiving infrared signals, the
      UR90, UR91, UR92 will only pay attention to throttles which
      are using the same LocoNet ID number. When receiving simplex
      radio signals, the UR91 will only pay attention to throttles
      which are using the same LocoNet ID number.</p>

      <p>The LocoNet ID number is intended to allow multiple
      Digitrax layouts to operate independently when in close
      proximity. In this case, each each layout must use a
      different LocoNet ID number.</p>

      <p>If there are no other Digitrax layouts in close proximity,
      then there is no need to change the LocoNet ID number.</p>

      <p>When there is more than one UR9x device installed, it is
      important that all UR9x devices use the same LocoNet ID
      number.</p>

      <p>When there are no UR9x devices installed, this tool does
      not perform any useful function.</p>

      <h2>Using the LocoNet ID Tool</h2>

      <p>The LocoNet ID Tool may be used to read and to change the
      LocoNet ID number.</p>

      <p>Use the "Query" button to read the current LocoNet ID
      number. If a UR9x device responds to the query, the reported
      LocoNet ID number will be updated in the tool.</p>

      <p>To change the LocoNet ID number, use the pull-down box to
      select the desired LocoNet ID number, then use the "Set"
      button to write the LocoNet ID number to the UR9x
      devices.</p>

      <p>After changing the LocoNet ID number, all throttles
      capable of tetherless operation must be un-plugged then
      plugged in to LocoNet so that they will accept the new
      LocoNet ID number. <i>Failure to acquire this updated LocoNet
      ID number on a throttle will prevent the throttle from
      communicating with the UR9x device via infrared and/or
      Simplex radio</i>.</p>

      <h2>Note</h2>

      <p>For the purposes of this discussion, the UR92CE is
      equivalent to the UR92. For clarity, this discussion only
      shows the term "UR92".</p>
