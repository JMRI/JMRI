<br>
The Slot Monitor tool displays a table of the "command
station slots'" contents. Slots are used to control
individual locomotives and consists. The display
includes the decoder's speed step format, current speed
and function settings, consist information and status.
You can choose to show either all slots or just the
ones being actively used.

<p>
The checkboxes at the top allow you to show just the active (in use) slots,
or all locomotive slots.  You can also choose whether to show the "system" slots,
which don't carry locomotive information.  The "estop all" button sets the
speed of all the locomotives to "Emergency Stop" very quickly.

<p>
The columns are:
<dl>
<dt>Slot<dd>The number of the slot
<dt>E Stop<dd>Click this button to set the speed of the decoder to emergency stop
<dt>Address<dd>The address of the locomotive the slot controls
<dt>Speed<dd>For unconsisted locomotives and addresses that are the top 
of a consist, this is the current speed setting.  It's an internal value
for consisted slots.
<dt>Status<dd>The format of the commands being sent to the decoder, 
typically either 128 step , 28 step, or 14 step, though other values are possible.
<dt>Use<dd>One of the four possible states:
    <dl>
    <dt>Free<dd>Not reserved for any particular use, no contents
    <dt>Idle<dd>Not reserved for any particular use, no contents
    <dt>Common<dd>Not in use at the moment, but still contains valid data for the last decoder to use it
    <dt>In Use<dd>Currently controlling a decoder
    </dl>
<dt>Free<dd>Click this button to free the slot, so it can be reused for another locomotive
<dt>Consisted<dd>Displays the consist status of the slot, whether it's not consisted,
the top of a consist, included in a consist, etc.
<dt>Throttle ID<dd>The ID of the throttle using this slot.  It's displayed as two hexadecimal bytes.
The second pair can be configured into the throttle, see the Digitrax instructions.
<dt>Direction<dd>Whether the decoder is currently being commanded to go Forward or Reverse
<dt>F0-F8<dd>The current function settings. Check mark indicates function is On.
