      <h2>JMRI: Select DCS240 USB Mode</h2>
      A <a href="../../../../../../html/hardware/loconet/DCS240.shtml">Digitrax DCS240</a> USB
      interface can act either as a stand-alone programmer, or as an interface to a LocoNet, but it
      can only do one at a time. Normally, you choose the USB mode as part of <a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/loconet/PR3.shtml">setting the JMRI connection
      preferences</a>.
      <p>In some cases, you might want to quickly change the mode during debugging. This tool
      provides two buttons to allow you to change the DCS240 USB mode immediately. <em>Note that
      this may result in unusual (and usually bad) behavior from the program!</em> It's generally
      better to switch mode by changing the JMRI preferences and restarting the program.</p>

      <p>For more information on the DCS240, please see its <a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/loconet/DCS240.shtml">JMRI reference page</a>.</p>
