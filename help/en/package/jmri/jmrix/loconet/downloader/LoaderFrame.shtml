      <h2 id="General">General information</h2>

      <p>Some LocoNet devices allow users to update the firmware
      (internal program) via the LocoNet connection. The LocoNet
      Download Firmware tool provides a mechanism to perform
      updates via a LocoNet connection.</p>

      <p><em>This tool is not used for loading sound projects into
      Digitrax sound decoders. The <a href=
      "../soundloader/LoaderFrame.shtml">Sound Download Tool</a>
      may be used for that purpose.</em></p>

      <p>This tool supports firmware update files distributed as
      either the ".dmf" (Digitrax Mangled Firmware) file format or
      a ".hex" file format (sometimes referred to as the Intel
      "I8HEX" file format).</p>

      <p>This version of the tool automatically determines how to
      interpret the firmware update and performs a number of file
      and data integrity checks before the update information can
      be used. If any issues are identified in the firmware file,
      the user is informed and the tool will not allow the user to
      update the device with what could be erroneous firmware
      information. This significantly reduces the risk of
      corrupting the device firmware as compared to previous
      versions of this tool.</p>

      <h2 id="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

      <p><strong>This tool is capable of modifying the firmware in
      LocoNet devices in ways that could make the devices
      inoperable.</strong> The developers of this tool have
      attempted to reduce the chances that the tool would corrupt a
      LocoNet device's firmware. We have successfully tried this
      tool with a variety of LocoNet devices, computers, operating
      systems, LocoNet interfaces, and firmware update files.</p>

      <p><strong>We cannot guarantee that there is no risk of
      corrupting device firmware when using this tool.</strong> It
      is impossible for the tool developers to predict every way of
      using the tool and it is impossible to predict the nuances of
      various devices, firmware files, computer operating systems,
      computer-to-LocoNet interface hardware, etc.</p>

      <p>In cases where a firmware update attempt does not apply
      properly, it is often possible to <a href="#Problem">re-apply
      the firmware update to the device</a> to restore proper
      device functionality. This has been recommended by at least
      one LocoNet device manufacturer and has been found to be
      effective in some cases by the developers of this tool.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Use this tool at your own
      risk.</strong></em></p>

      <h2 id="Updating">Updating Device Firmware Contents</h2>To
      use this tool to update a LocoNet device's firmware:

      <ul>
        <li>Consult the device manufacturer to determine if the
        device supports user updates of firmware.</li>

        <li>Acquire the appropriate firmware file from the device
        manufacturer.</li>

        <li>It is best to perform LocoNet firmware updates with a
        very simple LocoNet environment, including as little
        LocoNet hardware as possible. A good choice for a simple
        LocoNet firmware update configuration would include the
        device to be updated, a LocoNet-based command station, and
        a PC-to- LocoNet interface device. A simple LocoNet
        configuration helps reduce the amount of other LocoNet
        message traffic that could potentially disrupt the firmware
        update process. If you plan to re-configure your LocoNet
        connectivity to perform firmware updates, be sure that you
        will be able to restore your LocoNet connectivity properly
        once you have completed the update process. Take notes or
        make a drawing if necessary.</li>

        <li>The device being updated must be plugged into a live
        LocoNet connection. If the device can be battery powered,
        ensure that the batteries are good before starting this
        process. If the device uses an external power supply,
        ensure that it is powered and attached.</li>

        <li>Some devices may require changes to jumpers or DIP
        switch settings, and perhaps require removal and
        restoration of power, in order to allow the device to
        accept the firmware update via LocoNet. Devices produced by
        Digitrax which support LocoNet firmware updates do not
        require any physical configuration changes to the device.
        Consult the LocoNet device manufacturer's firmware update
        instructions for details.</li>

        <li>Open the LocoNet Firmware Download tool by selecting
        the "Download Firmware" item from the LocoNet menu. If you
        have more than one LocoNet connection, you must open the
        tool from the LocoNet menu which is associated with the
        connection which communicates with the device you wish to
        update.</li>

        <li>Click the Select button, and select the .dmf file or
        .hex file you want to use as the source of your firmware
        update. Click the Open button to select the file for use.
        The file will then be read and inspected for errors.

          <p>If the file is read and parsed successfully, the tool
          window will enable the "Download" and "Verify" buttons,
          and update the status message at the bottom of the window
          to state "Click Download to download new firmware".</p>

          <p>If the file cannot be read and parsed successfully, a
          pop-up message will appear or the tool window will update
          the status message at the bottom of the window with a
          description of the problem it found. For more
          information, see <a href="#ErrorMessages">Error
          Messages</a>, below.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Only if instructed to by the device manufacturer,
        change the various values in the Firmware File Properties
        portion of the display. It is usually not necessary to
        change any of the values.</li>

        <li>Click the Download button to update the firmware in the
        device. This may take a few seconds or minutes, depending
        on the amount of firmware to be updated and the speed at
        which the messages are sent to the device. A progress bar
        is displayed below the "Download", "Verify", and "Abort"
        buttons to show progress of the update process. The bar
        will darken from one end to the other as the update gets
        closer to completion.</li>

        <li>Once the update tool completes its work, <em>the tool
        is unable to tell if the LocoNet device has properly
        accepted the update</em>. This is a limitation of the
        LocoNet messaging used for the firmware update and firmware
        verify processes. Because of this limitation, the tool is
        only able to report that it has completed its work.

          <p>The device may provide an indication that the update
          process has completed (or failed) using lights on the
          product or on the display of the product. Consult the
          device manufacturer's instructions for further
          information.</p>
        </li>

        <li>After performing the firmware update, it may be
        necessary to reset or remove and restore power to the
        device. Consult the manufacturer's firmware update
        instructions.</li>

        <li>If you re-configured your LocoNet connectivity for a
        simplified LocoNet at the beginning of the firmware update
        process as described above, restore the LocoNet
        connectivity to its normal state.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="Problem">What if my device does not work correctly
      after updating the firmware?</h2>

      <p>Sometimes the device firmware update process does not
      appear to work, and the device may fail to provide its normal
      functionality. <em>Often, repeating the firmware update
      process one or more times will solve the problem.</em> This
      has been recommended by at least one LocoNet device
      manufacturer and has been found to be effective in many cases
      by the developers of this tool.</p>

      <p>As an example, if the firmware in a Digitrax DT402D
      throttle has been updated and that update was not successful,
      when the DT402D throttle is powered up, the display will
      usually show a series of dim, filled-in rectangles rather
      than the normal power-up display of model and firmware
      revision information. In this case, re-updating the device,
      using the process shown above, will usually restore the
      throttle to proper functionality.</p>

      <p>In other cases, a device may not be easily restored to
      proper operation after a firmware update attempt. In this
      case, consult the device manufacturer for further
      instructions.</p>

      <p>Consult your device documentation and, if necessary, the
      device manufacturer's technical support if your device fails
      to function properly after updating its firmware.</p>

      <h2 id="Verify">Verifying Device Firmware Contents</h2>

      <p>Some devices support a firmware "verify" process. This
      tool can perform the process to send the appropriate LocoNet
      messages by using the "Verify" button in the tool window.
      This tool <em>cannot</em> provide any indication of whether
      the device firmware does or does not match the firmware
      update file's information because there is no well-defined
      LocoNet message that conveys this type of information to the
      tool. Instead, the device may provide the pass or fail
      results of the verify process, perhaps by a specific blink
      sequence on an LED or by displaying a message on a display on
      the device. If a LocoNet device supports the verify
      operation, the manufacturer' s instructions should describe
      how the product provides status information for the results
      of the verify process.</p>

      <h2 id="ErrorMessages">Error Messages</h2>

      <p>This tool can identify problems at two different stages of
      the firmware update process. The tool checks for problems
      within the firmware update file when reading the file. When
      the user activates the "Download" or "Verify" button, the
      tool checks the validity of the parameters which the user can
      change in the tool window for obvious problems. If any issues
      are found at either of these stages, the tool will update the
      message at the bottom of the tool window. If a parameter is
      found to be out of range, that parameter value will be shown
      with red text instead of black text. The "Download" and
      "Verify" buttons will not perform any useful function if any
      of the parameters are invalid.</p>

      <p>Typically, when this type of pop-up window appears, a
      message in the JMRI "console" log will provide additional
      technical detail about the problem. The firmware update file
      provider may find this information useful in correcting
      firmware update file issues.</p>

      <p>The tool may also create a pop-up window under certain
      circumstances.</p>

      <h3 id="NoInputFile">"You Must Select An Input File" Pop-up
      Window</h3>

      <p>The tool will open a pop-up window with this message if
      the user uses the "Cancel" button on the file selection
      pop-up window. The tool cannot perform a firmware update if
      no firmware file is selected.</p>

      <h3 id="FileNotFound">"File Not Found" Pop-up Window</h3>

      <p>The tool will open a pop-up window if the file selected by
      the user does not exist. The pop-up window will state that
      the file was not found. Use the "Select" button to re-specify
      the correct firmware file.</p>

      <h3 id="InvalidOptionsInFile">"Invalid value for Options key"
      Pop-up Window</h3>

      <p>The tool will open a pop-up window if the file selected by
      the user contains a value for the "Options" key which is not
      supported by this tool. Consult the device manufacturer for
      advice if this occurs.</p>

      <h3 id="FileReadError">"Firmware file cannot be read." Status
      Message</h3>

      <p>This status message is shown when an abnormal event occurs
      which prevents the tool from reading the file from the disk.
      This is typically a problem with the computer or the media
      from which the file is being read.</p>

      <h3 id="ParameterValidationProblem">"Invalid parameter(s)
      above." Status Message</h3>

      <p>This message indicates that one or more of the values are
      out of range. Usually it is unnecessary for the user to
      change any of the parameter values because either the tool's
      default values are appropriate or because the firmware file
      specifies the required values. If an invalid value is found
      in one of the parameter entry fields, the invalid parameter
      will be highlighted in red. To resolve the problem, close the
      Firmware Download tool, then re-open it and re-read the file.
      Be careful not to change any of the parameter field values.
      If the tool still identifies a value as invalid, consult the
      device manufacturer.</p>

      <h3 id="nullFirmwareData">Do not have any firmware
      information to send." Status Message</h3>

      <p>This status message indicates that the firmware file did
      not contain any valid firmware information. Consult the
      device manufacturer for a valid firmware file.</p>

      <h3 id="ContentNotUnderstood">"Firmware content in the file
      is not understood" Status message</h3>

      <p>When the tool reads a firmware file which it does not
      understand, it will show the message "Firmware content in the
      file is not understood by this reader." in the status line at
      the bottom of the tool window. Consult the device
      manufacturer for support - usually this means that the
      manufacturer must provide a new firmware file.</p>
      
      <h3 id="InvalidParameterInFile">"Invalid Prog Blk Size parameter in file" dialog box message</h3>
      <p>When the tool reads a firmware file and can determine that the file
      requires a process which the tool cannot support, the tool will pop-up a dialog
      box saying "Invalid Prog Blk Size parameter ...".  The tool will prevent 
      itself from attempting to update the device.  This applies to firmware 
      updates for some newer Digitrax hardware which requires a different firmware 
      update process.  For these devices, the Digitrax <em>DigiIPLII</em> software
      should be used.</p><br clear="all">

          because this tool does not implement the correct protocol.  <em>Using the 
          protocol implemented in this tool when a newer protocol is required 
          would result in a corrupted firmware image in the device.</em>  Use

      <h2 id="Notes">Other Notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>The LocoNet Firmware Download tool is similar to the
        "DigiIPL.exe" and "DigiIPLII.exe" which have been released 
        by Digitrax.  "DigiIPLII.exe" is available from their web site as 
        part of the SoundLoader2 package. Support for the DigiIPLII.exe
        program is provided by Digitrax. Note that DigiIPLII.exe is
        intended for use with Digitrax products and is not able to
        perform firmware updates on at least some non-Digitrax
        hardware.</li>

        <li>This tool does <strong>not</strong> receive any LocoNet
        messages from the device as part of the firmware update
        process. At the time this tool was written, the firmware
        protocol does not define any sort of feedback from the
        device to the programming tool. As such, it is not possible
        for this tool to provide any definitive indication of the
        success of a firmware update or firmware verify operation.
        It is up to the user to determine if the device has been
        properly updated.</li>

        <li>This version of the tool does <strong>not</strong>
        allow the user to configure the file addressing format. The
        tool automatically determines whether the file uses 16-bit
        or 24-bit addressing. This removes the possibility that the
        wrong setting could be used.</li>

        <li>This tool cannot be used to update the firmware in the
        LocoBuffer-II device.</li>

        <li>It is possible to update firmware on multiple
        devices of the same type at the same time. If attempting
        this, ensure that the devices are all actively connected to
        LocoNet, properly powered, and properly configured before
        activating the "Download" button. The developers of this
        tool do not recommend this as any failure of the process
        could result in all of the hardware being updated becoming 
        unusable.</li>

        <li>Do not open multiple LocoNet Firmware Download tools at
        the same time. Do not perform firmware updates and/or
        verifies from multiple sources (computers) simultaneously,
        as this is likely to result in corrupted device
        firmware.</li>

        <li>If the selected update file's filename is too long to
        fit the tool window, the filename will be displayed in a
        shortened form. If the cursor is placed over the displayed
        filename, the "tool tip" will attempt to show the complete
        file name.</li>
      </ul>
