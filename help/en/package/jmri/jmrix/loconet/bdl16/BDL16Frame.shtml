      <h1>Configure Digitrax BDL16x</h1>
      <a href="BDL16xConfigTool.png"><img src="BDL16xConfigTool.png"
      alt="BDL16x Configuration Tool Screen" width="386" height="423" align="right"></a>

      <p>The JMRI BDL16x programming tool lets you configure the
      internal options of a BDL16, BDL162, or BDL168 directly from
      your computer, when the board is connected to a JMRI LocoNet 
      connection.</p>

      <p>To open this tool select "Configure BDL16/BDL162/BDL168" from the LocoNet
      menu.</p>
      
      <h2>Selecting the BDL16x board</h2>
      
      <p>Each BDL16x device present on the LocoNet connection is identified by its "Board ID".
      This tool may access a particular BDL16x device by entering the "Board ID" number in 
      the selection box at the upper left of the tool window.</p>
      
      <p>Upon start-up, this tool queries the LocoNet connection to create a list 
      of BDL16x devices.  Each BDL16x Board ID is added to the list in the pull-down
      selector, accessed by selecting the downward-pointing triangle which is just 
      to the right of the Board ID text entry space.</p>
      
      <p>Any time that a Board ID number is typed into the Board ID text entry space,
      the number will be added to the list if it is not already present in the list.</p>
      
      <h2>Reading and writing the OpSw settings</h2>
       
      <p>This tool only accesses the board's OpSw values when the "Read Full Sheet" 
          or "Write Full Sheet" button is pressed.</p>
      
      <p>The "Read Full Sheet" button may be used to read the OpSw settings from 
      the BDL16x.  Performing the "Read Full Sheet" operation reads all OpSw values from the
      board selected by the "Board ID" field and updates each of the tool's 
      selections.</p>
      
      <p>The "Write Full Sheet" button may be used to write the OpSw settings 
          currently shown in the tool to the BDL16x device specified by the "Board ID"
          number shown at the top of the window.  Performing the "Write Full Sheet" 
          operation writes all OpSw values to the board.</p>
      
      <h2>The configurable options</h2>

      <p>The basic operating settings are shown grouped into three sections:
      <ul>
        <li>The top-most section shows the options which apply to all BDL16x types.</li>
        <li>Immediately below are the basic operating settings which apply only to the BDL162
        and BDL168.</li>
        <li>Below this are the basic operating settings which apply only to the BDL168.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Each setting may be changed by selecting one of the options from the pull-down
      list of values.</p>

      <p>When performing a "Write Full Sheet" operation to a BDL16 or BDL162 device, 
          this tool will write all of the OpSw values, not just the OpSw values which
          are defined for the BDL16 or BDL162 device.  This is thought to be safe, as
          it is thought that these OpSw values will be ignored by the hardware.  If
          you are concerned that this may not be acceptable, then select the "default" 
          value for the OpSw values which do not apply to the board type which you 
          are configuring. </p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>This tool is not able to detect the difference between
        a BDL16, a BDL162, and a BDL168. As such, it always shows
        all OpSw values and descriptions for the BDL168, and the "Write 
        Full Sheet" operation will write all OpSw values.</li>

        <li>This tool is able to access BDL16x boards with
        addresses between 1 and 256. Users are advised to avoid
        using the factory default board address (board address 1)
        as it will be difficult to program new boards with unique
        data if any in-service board is using the factory default
        board address.</li>

        <li>Because of the way the BDL16x board works, this tool
        can't change the basic address of the unit. The BDL16x
        documentation describes how to change the board
        address.</li>
      </ul>
