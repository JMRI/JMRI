      <p>The JMRI DS64 Configuration tool lets you configure the
      internal options of a Digitrax DS64 Stationary Decoder
      directly from your computer running JMRI.</p>

      <p>To open this tool select "Configure DS64" from the LocoNet
      menu.</p>
      
      <h2>Selecting the DS64 board</h2>
      <p>Each DS64 present on LocoNet is identified uniquely by its <a href=
          "http://www.digitrax.com/tsd/KB805/ds64-setting-board-id-for-additional-ds64s/">
          "Board ID"</a>.  This tool may access a particular DS64 by entering the
          Board ID number in the selection box at the top of the window.</p>
      <p>Upon start-up, this tool queries LocoNet to create a list of DS64s.  Each 
          DS64 Board Id is listed in the pull-down selector.  New Board Id numbers
          may be typed into the box and will be added to the list.</p>

      <h2>Configuring the basic operating modes</h2>
      <p>The basic operations are configured on the "Basic Settings" tab.  This tab 
          gives human-readable descriptions of the various options.  Changes made 
          here are immediately reflected on the "OpSw Values" tab, but are not 
          written to the addressed DS64 until the "Write full sheet" button is 
          pressed.</p>
      <p>The "Read full Sheet" button may be used to read the OpSw settings from the DS64.</p>
          
      <h2>Configuring the OpSws</h2>
      <p>This tab displays the "OpSw" settings which correspond to the settings found
          on the "Basic Settings" tab.  Changes made on this tab will immediately 
          reflected on the "Basic Settings" tab.</p>
      <p>The "Read full Sheet" pushbutton may be used to read the OpSws from the 
          addressed DS64.  The "Write Full Sheet" pushbutton may be used to write 
          the OpSw values to the addressed DS64.</p>

      <h2>Configuring the Output Addresses</h2>
      <p>The "Output Addresses" tab allows reading and writing the DS64 output 
          addresses.  The addresses need not be sequential.  
      <p>The "Read full Sheet" pushbutton may be used to read the Output addresses from the 
          addressed DS64.  The "Write Full Sheet" pushbutton may be used to write 
          the Output addresses to the addressed DS64.</p>

      <h2>Configuring Routes</h2>
      <p>Each DS64 may be programmed to hold up to 8 "Routes".  Each route consists
          of a "Top" (or "trigger") switch command, plus up to seven additional switch commands.
          When the "Top" ("trigger") switch command is seen by the DS64 on LocoNet, the 
          DS64 will send the other switch commands to LocoNet.</p>
      <p>When the proper OpSw settings are made, the DS64 A* and S* input signals may
          each be used to trigger one of the programmed routes.</p>
      <p>This tool allows configuring each of the 8 "Routes" via the "Routes" tab.
          Once the "Routes" tab is selected, an individual "Route" is selected on 
          the left side by selecting one of the tabs.</p>
      <p>Within each individual Route, the "Top" turnout command is the command 
          which begins the sequence.  The received LocoNet command must match the "Top" turnout
          command exactly - both in address and direction, in order to trigger the 
          route.  Once triggered, the DS64 will transmit the subsequent turnout messages
          to LocoNet.</p>
      <p>When DS64 inputs are used to trigger the route, the DS64 will transmit the
          "Top" switch command, as well as the subsequent commands.
      <p>Each entry in the route may be "unused" or may have a turnout address plus 
          a direction.  The DS64 will only send those entries which are not "Unused",
          starting from the "Top" of the list, working downward until the first "Unused" 
          entry is found, or until the last entry is sent.</p>
      <p>Note that it is not necessary to enter a duplicate turnout command to terminate 
          the route before the end of the list.  Simply configure a turnout as "Unused" 
          to terminate the route.</p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>Because of the way the DS64 board works,
          this tool can't change the basic address of the unit.</p>
      <p>This tool does not have the capability to save the DS64 configuration.
