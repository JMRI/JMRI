      <h1>Monitor LocoNet Traffic</h1><a href=

      The LocoNet Monitor tool displays LocoNet traffic in a
      human-readable form. The most recent messages are available
      in a scrolling window. Optionally, you can include the time
      the message was received, and/or the raw packet bytes. The
      log information can also be stored in a text file.

      <h2>LocoNet Monitor "Controls"</h2>For more information on
      the various controls and options, please see the <a href=
      "../../AbstractMonFrame.shtml">Communications Monitor Window
      page</a>.

      <h2>LocoNet Monitor "Raw Data"</h2>

      <p>When the LocoNet Monitor is configured to include "raw
      data" in its output, it differentiates between messages sent
      by JMRI to the interface hardware and those messages coming
      back from the LocoNet interface hardware. The "Raw data" for
      those messages which JMRI sends to the LocoNet interface
      hardware are prefixed with "Tx - ". The "Raw data" for those
      messages which the LocoNet interface hardware provides to
      JMRI are prefixed with "Rx - ".</p>

      <h2>LocoNet Monitor Timestamps</h2>

      <p>When Timestamps are enabled, each message is preceeded by
      the computer time when JMRI sees the message. For a variety
      of technical reasons, these timestamps cannot reflect the
      actual time when the message is on the LocoNet data
      wires.</p>

      <p>Because of this, a wide range of odd effects can be seen.
      Two different messages can be shown with the same timestamp.
      A transmit message and a receive message can have the same
      timestamp. And a "Rx" message show up in the display before
      the "Tx" message is shown.</p>

      <p>These behaviors are normal and expected, even though they
      can be annoying. These behaviors result from a combination of
      the implementations of JMRI, Java, the computer operating
      system, the computer hardware and the LocoNet interface
      hardware. As such, the JMRI implementation has very little
      control over these odd behaviors, although the JMRI
      developers have attempted to minimize the influence of these
      odd behaviors upon JMRI.</p>

      <h2>Filtering LocoNet Messages</h2>

      <p>Users may specify LocoNet "OpCode" values which should be
      filtered (ignored) by LocoNet Monitor. Filtering messages in
      LocoNet monitor does <strong>not</strong> prevent messages
      from getting to other JMRI components, and does
      <strong>not</strong> prevent messages from being sent to the
      LocoNet interface hardware; filtering only affects the
      display of LocoNet messages.</p>

      <p>The "Filter Bytes:" text entry area on the LocoNet monitor
      window may be used to specify one or more LocoNet message
      "OpCode(s)". When the LocoNet monitor is notified of a
      LocoNet message, the message's OpCode value is compared to
      the hexadecimal value(s) in the "Filter Bytes:" text entry
      area. If the message's OpCode value is specified in the text
      entry area, then the LocoNet monitor will ignore the
      message.</p>

      <p>A LocoNet OpCode value is entered as a two character
      hexadecimal value, such as "81", "A0" and "E5", without
      quotes. When multiple OpCode values are to be filtered,
      provide a space between each value, such as "81 E5 A0"
      (without quotes).</p>

      <p>The filtering mechanism checks only the first byte of the
      LocoNet message. This means that the filtering mechanism
      cannot specifically ignore those LocoNet messages which rely
      on more than the OpCode value to define the specific LocoNet
      message. This is a known limitation of the message filtering
      mechanism.</p>

      <p>Specific information on many LocoNet OpCode values can be
      found in documentation provided by Digitrax, while others are
      not publicly documented. Below is a short list of some OpCode
      values and the associated LocoNet functionality.</p>
