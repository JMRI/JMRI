      <h1>SPJ Sound File Editor</h1>
      <p>Digitrax sound decoders are
      loaded with "sound projects", stored in "Sound Project"
      (.spj) files. Those contain a number of "sound fragments" in
      .wav format, plus a small program that tells the decoder when
      to play the various sounds, and controls the use of functions
      and CVs. That program is stored in a "Sound Definition" (SDF)
      format.</p>

      <p>The "Digitrax SPJ Editor" window allows you to examine and
      change the contents of a sound project file. Once you've
      changed them, you can install them into your decoder with the
      <a href="LoaderFrame.shtml">sound downloader</a>.</p>

      <p>Digitrax provides sample sound project files at their
      Sound Depot <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/sounddepot.php">(http://www.digitrax.com/sounddepot.php)</a>
      web site. You can also find links to documentation and
      additional tools there.</p>

      <p>When you invoke the SPJ Sounds File Editor tool from the
      LocoNet menu, you first get a file selection window:<br>
      <img src="OpenFilePane.gif" width="240" height="61" alt=
      "File selection window"></p>

      <p>Click "Open File..." and select the .spj file that you'd
      like to work with. (The examples on this page are from the
      Digitrax AC4400 example) The editor window will then expand
      to show the content of the file:<br>
      <a href="InitEditorPane.gif"><img src="InitEditorPane.gif"
      width="351" height="251" alt="Initial Editor Image"></a><br>
      (Click on any of the images on this page to see a full size
      version)</p>

      <p>Most of the content of a DIgitrax SPJ file is the
      individual .wav sound fragments. For those, the columns of
      the table are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The number of the fragment</li>

        <li>The type, WAV for .wav sound fragments</li>

        <li>The short name given this fragment by the file's
        author</li>

        <li>The handle number, which the SDF sound definition uses
        to refer to the sound</li>

        <li>The original filename for this fragment</li>

        <li>The fragments length in second</li>

        <li>A button that plays the sound on your computers
        speakers</li>

        <li>A "Replace" button</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you click the "Replace" button on a sound fragment, a
      file selection window opens in which you can select a new
      sound file (.wav file) which the replaces the original
      fragment. The new file should contain 8-bit unsigned monaural
      sound sampled 11.025kHz. Other formats might or might not
      work, but we know that this one does.</p>

      <p>After making changes, you can click "Save" at the top of
      the editor window to save the file with the original name, or
      (better) under another name. You can then use the <a href=
      "LoaderFrame.shtml">Sound Downloader</a> tool to load the
      modified file into a Digitrax decoder via a <a href=
      "../../../../../html/hardware/loconet/PR2.shtml">PR2</a> or
      <a href=
      "../../../../../html/hardware/loconet/PR3.shtml">PR3</a>
      interface.</p>

      <p>SPJ files contains some additional parts, visible at the
      bottom of the list here:<br>
      <a href="LowerEditorPane.gif"><img src="LowerEditorPane.gif"
      width="351" height="251" alt="Lower Editor Image"></a></p>

      <p>The "comment" element contains human-readable information
      from the SPJ file's author, in a specific format with other
      parts of DecoderPro are able to read. The View button shows
      it in another window:<br>
      <a href="CommentWindow.gif"><img src="CommentWindow.gif"
      width="360" height="316" alt="Comment View"></a></p>

      <p>The ".map file" element contains the connection between
      sound names (3rd column) and handle number (4th column) used
      by the SDF sound program. The View button shows it in another
      window:<br>
      <a href="MapPane.gif"><img src="MapPane.gif" width="82"
      height="237" alt="MAP View"></a></p>

      <p>The "SDF" element contains the Sound Definition File (or
      Format) information that the decoder uses to determine which
      sound fragments to show when. These are written in a form of
      assembly language, written in a specific format. The file
      only contains the result of that process; the human-readable
      source code is not stored in the SPJ file. Still, JMRI can
      recreate it (except for the original spacing and comments) to
      give you a rough idea of the content, and will show that in
      another window if you click the View button:<br>
      <a href="SDFview.gif"><img src="SDFview.gif" width="620"
      height="439" alt="SDF View"></a><br>
      JMRI also provides a limited capability to edit the SDF
      information using the <a href=
      "../sdfeditor/EditorFrame.shtml">SDF Editor</a>. Click the
      "Edit" button to open a separate SDF editor window, with its
      own <a href="../sdfeditor/EditorFrame.shtml">help
      page</a>.<br>
      <a href="../sdfeditor/SdfInitSound.gif"><img src=
      "../sdfeditor/SdfInitSound.gif" width="415" height="235" alt=
      "SDF Editor"></a></p>

      <p>The "CV data" element isn't used by JMRI. DecoderPro uses
      another method for storing CV information.</p>

      <h2>Related Tools</h2>The JMRI <a href=
      "LoaderFrame.shtml">Sound File Downloader</a> lets you
      download SPJ sound files to a Digitrax decoder if you have a
      Digitrax PR2 interface.

      <p>The <a href="../sdfeditor/EditorFrame.shtml">SDF
      Editor</a>, referenced above, lets you edit the SDF program
      within a SPJ file.</p>
