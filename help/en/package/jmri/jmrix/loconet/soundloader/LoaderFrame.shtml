      <h1>Sound Loader</h1>Digitrax sound decoders are loaded with
      "sound projects", stored in "Sound Project" (.spj) files.
      Those contain a number of "sound fragments" in .wav format,
      plus some additional control information.

      <p>The Decoder Sound Downloader tool lets you load a new .spj
      file into a Digitrax sound decoder via a Digitrax PR2 or PR3
      interface. If you're using a PR3, it needs to be put into
      "Programmer mode" before trying to download, see the main
      <a href="../../../../../html/hardware/loconet/PR3.shtml">PR3
      page</a>.</p>

      <p>Digitrax provides sample sound project files at their
      Sound Depot <a href=
      "http://www.digitrax.com/sounddepot.php">(http://www.digitrax.com/sounddepot.php)</a>
      web site. You can also find links to documentation and
      additional tools there.</p>

      <p>JMRI also provides tools for <a href=
      "EditorFrame.shtml">editing sound project files</a> to
      include new sounds and even to <a href=
      "../sdfeditor/EditorFrame.shtml">change the sound
      logic</a>.</p>

      <h2>Using the downloader</h2>When you first select the
      Download Sounds tool, it opens a window with most of the
      controls disabled:<br>
      <a href="LoaderPane.gif"><img src="LoaderPane.gif" width=
      "236" height="118" alt="Initial Editor Image"></a><br>
      (Click on any image on this page to see a larger version)

      <p>The status line at the bottom will walk you through the
      steps needed.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>First, click "Select" and pick the .spj file you want
        to download.</li>

        <li>Next, click "Read" to read the file (this is a separate
        step so you can just click "Read" multiple times if you're
        editing and saving new versions of the file).

          <p>If everything is OK, the file will be read into the
          program and verified, a version string from the file will
          be displayed, and the "Download" button will be
          enabled.</p>

          <p><a href="LoaderPaneReady.gif"><img src=
          "LoaderPaneReady.gif" width="236" height="118" alt=
          "Initial Editor Image"></a><br></p>
        </li>

        <li>Click "Download" to start the download process. It will
        take a little while. The progress is described in the
        status line:

          <dl>
            <dt>"Starting download; erase flash"</dt>

            <dd>The first step is to erase the decoders memory so
            it can take new data. This will take up to about 30
            secondx, depending on the specific decoder.</dd>

            <dt>"Sending initialization message"</dt>

            <dd>Set up the decoder to accept data after being
            erased. This should only take a fraction of a
            second.</dd>

            <dt>"Send SDF data"</dt>

            <dd>Load the Sound Definition data into the decoder,
            which should only take a few seconds</dd>

            <dt>"Send WAV data"</dt>

            <dd>The sound data is being downloaded. As each block
            is sent you'll get an update: "Send WAV data block 1",
            then 2, then 3, etc.</dd>

            <dt>"Done"</dt>

            <dd>The downloadload completed OK.</dd>
          </dl>If something goes wrong, the final status will be
          "Download aborted". The most common reason is that the
          PR2 couldn't handle the data that was being send, which
          is listed as "PR2 not ready". If this happens repeatedly,
          make sure that the serial port and cable that the PR2 is
          using as the control leads properly connected. An
          intermitted cable can cause problems here.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>If you have more decoders to load with the same file, you
      can just connect them each in turn to the PR2/PR3 and click
      "Download", there's no need to reload the file each time.</p>

      <p>Also, you can use a JMRI <a href=
      "../../../../../html/tools/throttle/ThrottleMain.shtml">Throttle</a>
      to try out your new sounds via the PR2. JMRI takes care of
      converting the PR2/PR3 from a programmer/loader into a low
      power command station to run the locomotive.</p>
