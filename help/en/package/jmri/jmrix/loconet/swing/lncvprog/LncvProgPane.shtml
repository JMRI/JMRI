      <h1>LocoNet LNCV Programming Pane</h1>

      <p><span class="since">since 4.21.4</span>The "Configure LNCV Modules" tool lets you access
      and program connected LocoNet devices that respond to the (Uhlenbrock) LNCV LocoNet
      programming protocol.<br>
      Examples are the Uhlenbrock Switch Module 63410 and Digikeijs DR5033 booster. You find the
      tool in the LocoNet menu as long as a LocoNet connection is available.</p>
      <img src="images/LNCVTool1.png" alt="Initial view of LNCV Programming Tool pane"> <img src=
      "images/LNCVTool2.png" alt="LNCV Programming Tool pane with Article and Address filled in">
      <p>As the tool is new, you might use it in combination with the "Show Raw Data" option in the
      <a href="../../locomon/LocoMonFrame.shtml">LocoNet Monitor</a> to check for any additional
      responses rejected by the LNCV filters.</p>

      <p>Unless a programming session is running, LNCV modules will not respond to Write commands
      (the Read and Write buttons in the tool are enabled during a session).</p>

      <h2>Module LNCV Programming</h2>

      <p>LNCV Programming requires 3 elements to address CV in an LNCV module on LocoNet:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Article Number (aka type/class/productID)</li>

        <li>Module Address (optional, see below)</li>

        <li>CV number</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Uhlenbrock and Digikeijs/Digirails publish the Article number for each (new) device. For
      example, the Digikeijs DigiBoost DR5033 has Article number 5033, which was registered with
      Uhlenbrock.<br>
      Enter the Article number eg. 5033 in the "Article" field before proceeding.<br>
      Next, enter the Module Address in the corresponding field.</p>

      <p>After opening a programming session, the "Open Module Programming" stays highlighted and
      the Read and Write buttons are enabled.<br>
      To close the programming of a module, click the same button, that now reads "Stop Module
      Programming".<br>
      While a programming session is running this button is highlighted and the Address field is
      not editable, to prevent switching module address without first closing the session running.
      Note that changing the module address stored in CV0 won't immediately halt the session, so
      take care and close the current session before opening a new session on the new module
      address.</p>

      <p>For incidental programming, the tool allows reading and writing of individual CV
      value.<br>
      To read, enter a CV number in the fields on the right of the tool pane and click [Read] to
      see the value in the Value field.<br>
      To write, enter a CV number plus the new value to set in the CV, and click [Write].</p>

      <p>LNCV Responses coming back from the layout will be listed in the table. When your Roster
      contains (exactly) one entry for a decoder of this article number and address, it will be
      listed in the table as shown below.<br>
      When no match was found in your Roster but a matching definition was found in the JMRI
      Decoder Index, a [Create Entry] button will show. Be sure to complete the Entry creation
      process by clicking [Save to Roster] on the Roster Entry tab. If your device reponded to a
      general call but is not yet supported, the button will read [No Match in Roster] (and it
      won't work). Once you have a Roster Entry, the button will read [Program] and will directly
      open the entry tabs.</p>

      "LNCV Programming Tool found a Decoder Entry and shows Program button"> <img src=

      "LNCV Programming Tool can't find a matching definition">
      <h2>Broadcast LNCV Programming</h2>

      <p>Older LNCV devices may not have their own address, or even no article ID. They can be
      programmed using Broadcast mode, but you have to be sure only one such device is powered, as
      they all would respond to programming commands.</p>

      <p>Click "Start Broadcast Programming" to start a session.</p>

      <p>To close a Broadcast session, click "Stop Broadcast Programming".</p>

      <p>Using the universal address 65535 (or simply leaving the Article field empty) you can, as
      the name suggests, call up all LNCV Adapters that want to respond (not all do).<br>
      As the universal address is not valid for addressing specific modules, it can only be used to
      call up an individual adapter for which the address is unknown. For this you connect the said
      adapter to the LocoNet. The adapter can then be called up and its address read from LNCV
      0.<br>
      By only filling in an Article number (and leaving the address field empty) you can send a
      Broadcast call to all devices of that specific type, and many devices will respond by
      providing their DCC address, which will be added to the table. Once you have the report back
      from the layout, click [Close Broadcast Session] to exit the general access.<br>
      Click on one of the rows to copy the address to the top, and click [Start Module Programming]
      to continue.</p>

      <h2>Direct Mode</h2>

      <p>Check the 'Direct Mode' checkbox to access 16 state buttons to set LEDs etc. on
      Track-Control items.</p>

      <h2>LNCV Decoder definitions</h2>
      With an LNCV Module Programming session (to a specific device) running, you can use the
      Roster entry programming panes for more advanced (and accessible) configuration. Easily
      switch to DecoderPro Roster either by clicking the [Program] button in the table or manually
      open the entry for the module in your Roster entries list.<br>
      Go to the "LNCV (Booster) Configuration" tab to read and write options supported by the
      device.
      <p>Anyone interested in writing their own LNCV decoder definitions in JMRI, please note that
      in the definition programming mode should be defined as
      <code>&lt;mode&gt;LOCONETLNCVMODE&lt;/mode&gt;</code>.<br>
      The Article part (item 1. in the list above) must be defined in the definition as the<br>
      <code>&lt;model productID="5033" /&gt;</code>. To process LNCV commands in JMRI
      LnOpsProgrammer, elements 1. and 3. are combined into a single CV number as
      "part_1.part_3".<br>
      For example CV6 in the DR5033 is defined as:<br>
      <code>&lt;variable CV="5033.6" readOnly="yes" item="Temperature"&gt;</code></p>
