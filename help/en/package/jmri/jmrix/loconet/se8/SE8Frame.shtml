      <h1>Configure Digitrax SE8c</h1>

      <p>The JMRI SE8c programming tool lets you configure the
      internal options of a Digitrax SE8c Signaling Decoder Board
      directly from your computer.</p>

      <p>To open this tool from the JMRI pane select the
      LocoNet menu and then find the tool on the list.</p>

      <p>To use it, you put the address of an SE8c board in the
      text field and click "Read from SE8c". The tool will read
      back the current state of the various options, and set the
      check boxes to correspond to their current values.</p>

      <p>You can then, if you wish, change the checkboxes and click
      "Write to SE8c" to make your changes permanent.</p>

      <p>The tool relies upon each SE8C board to have a unique "Board ID" (Board
      Address) in order to configure each device individually.  While it is
      possible to change the Board ID number using JMRI, it cannot be done using
      this tool due to limitations of the SE8C design.  Instead,
      follow the instructions found <a href="../../../../../html/hardware/loconet/Digitrax.shtml#deviceBoardId">
      here</a>, but you must consult the SE8C manual and modify the
      JMRI-based process to suit the SE8C device's buttons, button press time,
      and lamp flashes.</p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Because of the way the SE8c board works, this tool
        can't change the basic address of the unit.  It is possible to change
              the Board ID number using JMRI by following the instructions found
              <a href="../../../../../html/hardware/loconet/Digitrax.shtml#deviceBoardId">
              here</a>. Note that it is necessary to consult the SE8C manual and
              modify the JMRI-based process shown at the link above to suit the
              SE8C's buttons, button press time, and lamp flashes.</li>

        <li>The SE8c can be configured to send Sensor status on the
        LocoNet in response to a "track power on" command. The SE8c
        does not send Turnout status in response to a "track power
        on" command.</li>

        <li>This tool is able to access SE8c boards with addresses
        between 1 and 36. Users are advised to avoid using the
        factory default board address (board address 1) as it will
        be difficult to program new boards with unique data if any
        in-service board is using the factory default board
        address.</li>
      </ul>
