      <h1>Bachrus Speedometer</h1>
      - awaiting image -<br>

      <p>Set up the loco to be measured on a running stand with the
      reader unit appropriate to the track gauge, connected to the
      MTS-DCC which is connected, in turn, to the PC.</p>

      <p>Connect the track on which the running stand is installed
      to your DCC system.</p>

      <p>Add both the DCC system and the reader interface as layout
      connections in the JMRI preferences. Open the Speedo console
      from the Speedo menu on the main screen of DecoderPro or
      PanelPro.</p>

      <p>The left side of the window is used for setup and to
      display the current speed:</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../html/hardware/bachrus/images/dial.jpg"><img src=
      "../../../../html/hardware/bachrus/images/dial.jpg" width=
      "336" height="373" alt="Send Frame Tool"></a></p>

      <p><b>Select Scale:</b> The reader type will be detected when
      the loco is driven and speed data is received from the
      reader. Use the Scale drop-down to select the appropriate
      locomotive scale in order to get the correct speed
      values.</p>

      <p><b>Select Mode:</b> If you have a DCC system that can run
      locomotives on the programming track (such as the SPROG) then
      select "Run profile on programming track" as this will allow
      reading the locomotive address, etc. without moving between
      the programming track and a running track. If you can't run
      locomotives on your programming track, then select "Run
      profile on the main track".</p>

      <p><b>Measured Speed:</b> The radio buttons to the right of
      the dial allow the primary (black) speed digits to display
      the scale speed in either Miles-per-Hour (MPH) or
      Kilometers-per-Hour (KPH) units. The secondary (green) digits
      display will show the other units. The speed is displayed
      digitally in the primary units in the small window at the
      bottom of the dial. The units on the speed profile graph also
      change to match. If the measured speed exceeds the maximum
      value on the dial, it will automatically re-scale itself to
      match. This can be reset using the "Reset Graph" button under
      the speed profile chart.</p>

      <p>Selecting the Numeric radio button will change the dial to
      just a box with the speed numerically displayed.</p>

      <p>At this stage you can use a throttle (either part of your
      DCC hardware or a JMRI throttle) to drive the loco and
      observe the scale speed.</p>

      <p>The right side of the window is used to measure the loco
      speed profile:</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../../../html/hardware/bachrus/images/profile.jpg"><img src="../../../../html/hardware/bachrus/images/profile.jpg"
      width="543" height="373" alt="Send Frame Tool"></a></p>

      <p><b>Loco Selection:</b> There are several ways to select
      the locomotive to profile:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You can enter the loco's DCC address manually by
        entering it in the text box, selecting whether it is a long
        or short address in the drop-down, and pressing the "Set
        Loco Address" button.</li>

        <li>If the loco is already in your roster, you can select
        it from the roster drop-down and its address will be
        selected automatically.</li>

        <li>If the DCC hardware supports service mode programming
        and you have selected "Run profile on programming track" in
        the "Select Mode" section, you can press the "Read" button
        to read the address directly from the loco.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Speed Profile Chart:</b> The radio buttons to the right
      of the chart allow you to select whether you want a profile
      for the locomotive running forward, or backwards, or both.
      The grid lines on the chart can be toggled off and on as
      well.</p>

      <p>Underneath the chart area are several buttons that control
      the creation of a speed profile:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Power Up/Power Down: This button allows you to manually
        turn track power on or off. It is also automatically
        invoked when a speed profile run is invoked.</li>

        <li>Start: This will start the running of a speed profile
        based on the other settings on the screen.</li>

        <li>Stop: This can be used to stop a profile run before it
        is finished. When a profile is finished the locomotive is
        automatically stopped and the track power is turned
        off.</li>

        <li>Export: This will allow you to export the results of
        the speed profile to a comma separated variables (CSV)
        file. This is a plain text file that can be opened by many
        other programs, including spreadsheets.</li>

        <li>Print: Use this to print a copy of the speed profile
        chart</li>

        <li>Reset Graph: This button will reset both the speed
        profile chart and speedometer dial scales to their default
        values if they have done an automatic re-scale because the
        speeds exceeded their limits. It also will erase any speed
        profiles being displayed.</li>

        <li>Load Ref: This button allows you to import a prior
        speed profile as a reference to make it easier to do speed
        matching. The profile can be one from another locomotive,
        or one that you create yourself with your desired speed
        values. The file to be loaded needs to match the format
        used for the Export function - there must be no less than
        31 lines in the file with the following format:

          <ul>
            <li>First line is a text header than can be any
            text.</li>

            <li>Second line holds the column headers - the main
            requirement is that the units used in the profile
            appear as "MPH" or "KPH" somewhere on the line. This is
            used for appropriate unit conversions when the profile
            is loaded.</li>

            <li>The next 29 lines hold the speed information, one
            line per speed step. The line must have the speed step
            number followed by a comma, and then the value for the
            speed. There can be more speed values on the line (for
            example if the file is an export of a forward/reverse
            speed profile) but the rest of the line is ignored.
            Note that the speed step number isn't actually used -
            the loading function simply assigns the 29 speed values
            in sequence, but something must be there since the
            second value on the line is used as the speed
            value.</li>

            <li>The easiest way to create an appropriate file is to
            Export a profile and then modify the speed values in
            the exported file (if needed).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>For best results the momentum CVs should be set to zero so
      that speed commands take immediate effect.</p><br>
