JMRI: RPS Tracking Frame

This frame displays a map of the 
<a href="../../../../../html/hardware/rps/index.shtml">RPS system's</a>
view of the layout.

<h2>Display</h2>
There are two types of things drawn:
<ul>
<li>The measured positions and paths of RPS transmitters
<li>The "detection regions" used for RPS blocks and 
<a href="../../../../../html/hardware/rps/sensors.shtml">sensors</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Transmitter Positions</h3>

When a good position reading is made, it's drawn on the screen
as a small circle representative of the measurement's accuracy.
A line is drawn to this new position from the last position.

<p>
Different colors are assigned to different transmitters so
you can tell them apart. If you "hover" the cursor over
a point, a tooltip will pop up that shows you which transmitter
was seen there and what position was measured.

<p>
Normally, bad measurements are just drawn as points, without
connecting them to the next measurement via a line. They often carry
very large position values, and will result in lines running off the panel.
If you do want to see them connected, check the "Show error points" checkbox.

<h3>Regions</h3>

JMRI can keep track of whether a region on the layout contains
working RPS transmitters.  This is used e.g. for the 
<a href="../../../../../html/hardware/rps/sensors.shtml">RPS sensors</a>
that are used to control signals.

<p>
These regions are displayed as blocks of color, possibly overlapping.

<p>
To get the exact coordinates of a region, hover the cursor over it.  
After a short time, a tooltip will display the coordinates of the corners.


<h2>Controls</h2>
In the top part of the window are some simple controls.
<ul>
<li>The "Clear" button erases the transmitter display, leaving the regions visible.
<li>The "Show error points" checkbox, mentioned above, will include 
lines to lower-quality measurements.
<li>"Show receivers", when checked, displays receiver locations as 
slightly larger black dots.
<li>"Show regions" controls whether the regions are drawn or not.
</ul>

The four text boxes and "Set" button let you set the coordinate mapping
for the window.  The top two set the RPS position that corresponds to the upper-right
corner of the display frame, while the lower two set the RPS position that corresponds to
the lower left corner.  The lower-left corner is often set to 0,0, and the upper left
set to large enough values to show your entire layout, but you don't have to do it like that.
