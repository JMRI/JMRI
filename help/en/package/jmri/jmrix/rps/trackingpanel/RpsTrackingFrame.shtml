      <h1>JMRI: RPS Tracking Frame</h1><a href=
      "../../../../../html/hardware/rps/images/RpsTracker.jpg"><img src="../../../../../html/hardware/rps/images/RpsTracker.jpg"

      This frame displays a map of the <a href=
      "../../../../../html/hardware/rps/index.shtml">RPS
      system's</a> view of the layout.

      <h2>Display</h2>There are two types of things drawn:

      <ul>
        <li>The measured positions and paths of RPS
        transmitters</li>

        <li>The "detection regions" used for RPS blocks and
        <a href="../../../../../html/hardware/rps/sensors.shtml">sensors</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Transmitter Positions</h3>When a good position reading is
      made, it's drawn on the screen as a small circle
      representative of the measurement's accuracy. A line is drawn
      to this new position from the last position.

      <p>Different colors are assigned to different transmitters so
      you can tell them apart. If you "hover" the cursor over a
      point, a tooltip will pop up that shows you which transmitter
      was seen there and what position was measured.</p>

      <p>Normally, bad measurements are just drawn as points,
      without connecting them to the next measurement via a line.
      They often carry very large position values, and will result
      in lines running off the panel. If you do want to see them
      connected, check the "Show error points" checkbox.</p>

      <h3>Regions</h3>JMRI can keep track of whether a region on
      the layout contains working RPS transmitters. This is used
      e.g. for the <a href=
      "../../../../../html/hardware/rps/sensors.shtml">RPS
      sensors</a> that are used to control signals.

      <p>These regions are displayed as blocks of color, possibly
      overlapping.</p>

      <p>To get the exact coordinates of a region, hover the cursor
      over it. After a short time, a tooltip will display the
      coordinates of the corners.</p>

      <h2>Controls</h2>In the top part of the window are some
      simple controls.

      <ul>
        <li>The "Clear" button erases the transmitter display,
        leaving the regions visible.</li>

        <li>The "Show error points" checkbox, mentioned above, will
        include lines to lower-quality measurements.</li>

        <li>"Show receivers", when checked, displays receiver
        locations as slightly larger black dots.</li>

        <li>"Show regions" controls whether the regions are drawn
        or not.</li>
      </ul>The four text boxes and "Set" button let you set the
      coordinate mapping for the window. The top two set the RPS
      position that corresponds to the upper-right corner of the
      display frame, while the lower two set the RPS position that
      corresponds to the lower left corner. The lower-left corner
      is often set to 0,0, and the upper left set to large enough
      values to show your entire layout, but you don't have to do
      it like that. <!--#include virtual="/Footer" -->
