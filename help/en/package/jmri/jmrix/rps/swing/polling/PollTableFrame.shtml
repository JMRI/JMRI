      <h1>JMRI: RPS Polling Control</h1>
      <a href="../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/images/PollControl.gif"><img src=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/images/PollControl.gif" height="80" width="300" alt=
      "RPS Receiver Control window" class="floatRight"></a>
      <p>The RPS Polling Control window is where you tell the <a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/index.shtml">RPS system</a> which of your locomotives
      have RPS transmitters installed, and how often to talk to them.</p>

      <p>When you open the window, you should see your entire <a href=
      "../../../../../../manual/DecoderPro3/Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">roster of locomotives</a>
      displayed, one per line.</p>

      <p>If a locomotive has a RPS transmitter installed and you'd like the system to track its
      position, check the box in the "Poll" column.</p>

      <p>To control whether the system as a whole is polling, check or uncheck the "Poll" box in
      the bottom section of the window.</p>

      <p>The table has nine columns:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Roster Name" - This is the locomotive decoder name from the roster.</li>

        <li>"ID" - The name that RPS uses to refer to this transmitter. By default, it's the same
        as the roster name, but you can change it if you'd like.</li>

        <li>"Locomotive Address" and "Long" - The DCC address of the decoder. The "Long" box will
        be checked if this is a "long" ("extended") address.</li>

        <li>"Polled" - Should the RPS system measure this position?</li>

        <li>"Last X", "Last Y", "Last Z" - The most recent measured position for this
        transmitter.</li>

        <li>"Last Time" - The time the last measurement was taken.</li>
      </ul>
      There are three radio buttons that control how polling is done.
      <dl>
        <dt>Use BSC Poll</dt>

        <dd>When checked, this uses a "Binary State Command" to poll the RPS system. If your RPS
        transmitters support this, it is the recommended setting except for with Lenz systems.</dd>

        <dt>Use Direct Poll</dt>

        <dd>When checked, JMRI sends F2 commands directly on the track. Use this if your RPS
        transmitters require F2 polls, and you don't have a Lenz DCC system.</dd>

        <dt>Use Throttle Poll</dt>

        <dd>When checked, JMRI simulates a throttle to send F2 polls. This is currently required
        for Lenz systems, and not recommended for others.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>The interval box controls the number of milliseconds between polls. This should not be set
      below about 80. If you are polling less than 5 transmitters, set it to 300 or above. This
      option will eventually be removed in a later JMRI version, when it becomes automatic.</p>

      <p>To save the values so they'll be automatically used when the program is next started,
      click "Store New Default Values".</p>
