      <h1>JMRI: RPS Polling Control</h1><a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/images/PollControl.gif"><img src="../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/images/PollControl.gif"
      height="80" width="300" alt="RPS Receiver Control window"
      align="right"></a>
      <p>The RPS Polling Control window is where you tell the <a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/index.shtml">RPS
      system</a> which of your locomotives have RPS transmitters
      installed, and how often to talk to them.</p>

      <p>When you open the window, you should see your entire
      <a href=
      "../../../../../../manual/Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">roster of
      locomotives</a> displayed, one per line.</p>

      <p>If a locomotive has a RPS transmitter installed and you'd
      like the system to track its position, check the box in the
      "Poll" column.</p>

      <p>To control whether the system as a whole is polling, check
      or uncheck the "Poll" box in the bottom section of the
      window.</p>

      <p>The table has nine columns:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Roster Name" - This is the locomotive decoder name
        from the roster.</li>

        <li>"ID" - The name that RPS uses to refer to this
        transmitter. By default, it's the same as the roster name,
        but you can change it if you'd like.</li>

        <li>"Locomotive Address" and "Long" - The DCC address of
        the decoder. The "Long" box will be checked if this is a
        "long" ("extended") address.</li>

        <li>"Polled" - Should the RPS system measure this
        position?</li>

        <li>"Last X", "Last Y", "Last Z" - The most recent measured
        position for this transmitter.</li>

        <li>"Last Time" - The time the last measurement was
        taken.</li>
      </ul>There are three radio buttons that control how polling
      is done.

      <dl>
        <dt>Use BSC Poll</dt>

        <dd>When checked, this uses a "Binary State Command" to
        poll the RPS system. If your RPS transmitters support this,
        it is the recommended setting except for with Lenz
        systems.</dd>

        <dt>Use Direct Poll</dt>

        <dd>When checked, JMRI sends F2 commands directly on the
        track. Use this if your RPS transmitters require F2 polls,
        and you don't have a Lenz DCC system.</dd>

        <dt>Use Throttle Poll</dt>

        <dd>When checked, JMRI simulates a throttle to send F2
        polls. This is currently required for Lenz systems, and not
        recommended for others.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>The interval box controls the number of milliseconds
      between polls. This should not be set below about 80. If you
      are polling less than 5 transmitters, set it to 300 or above.
      This option will eventually be removed in a later JMRI
      version, when it becomes automatic.</p>

      <p>To save the values so they'll be automatically used when
      the program is next started, click "Store New Default
      Values".</p>
