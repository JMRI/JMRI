      <p>The debugger window lets you look at information as it moves through the <a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/index.shtml">RPS system</a>.</p>

      <p>The upper left part displays the time value from each active receiver every time a reading
      is taken.</p>

      <p>If a position was successfully computed from a set of times, the "residual" value is
      displayed for each receiver. This is the difference between the measured time and the time
      that the RPS system expected to measure if the locomotive was really in that position.
      Typical value are up to about plus or minus 100, corresponding to about a inch in accuracy.
      If one or two receivers have much larger residual values, there may be a problem with the
      readings from that receiver with the transmitter in its current location.</p>

      <p>The bottom section of the window shows the position calculated from each reading. Below
      the calculated positions is the return code from the calculation. A positive value is
      considered OK, and a zero or negative value indicates some type of error.</p>

      <p>It's also possible to type values into the fields and ask the system to process them as if
      they were inputs. The selection box and button at the bottom are how you do this.</p>

      <p>The "File" menu includes a "Start CSV Export..." item which can be used to copy the raw
      input from the RPS system into a file. After you select this, you're presented with a file
      dialog for selecting the output file name. If you select the name of a file that already
      exists, it will be removed before output starts. Every RPS input after you select a file name
      will be written to that file, and the menu choice will change to "Stop CSV Export...". Select
      that menu choice to stop the logging and ensure that the last lines have been written
      out.</p>
