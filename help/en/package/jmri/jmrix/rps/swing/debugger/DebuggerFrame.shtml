      <h1>JMRI: RPS Debugger</h1><a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/images/Debugger.jpg"><img src="../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/images/Debugger.jpg"
      height="262" width="168" alt="RPS Receiver Control window"
      align="right"></a>
      <p>The debugger window lets you look at information as it moves
      through the <a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/rps/index.shtml">RPS
      system</a>.</p>

      <p>The upper left part displays the time value from each
      active receiver every time a reading is taken.</p>

      <p>If a position was successfully computed from a set of
      times, the "residual" value is displayed for each receiver.
      This is the difference between the measured time and the time
      that the RPS system expected to measure if the locomotive was
      really in that position. Typical value are up to about plus
      or minus 100, corresponding to about a inch in accuracy. If
      one or two receivers have much larger residual values, there
      may be a problem with the readings from that receiver with
      the transmitter in its current location.</p>

      <p>The bottom section of the window shows the position
      calculated from each reading. Below the calculated positions
      is the return code from the calculation. A positive value is
      considered OK, and a zero or negative value indicates some
      type of error.</p>

      <p>It's also possible to type values into the fields and ask
      the system to process them as if they were inputs. The
      selection box and button at the bottom are how you do
      this.</p>

      <p>The "File" menu includes a "Start CSV Export..." item
      which can be used to copy the raw input from the RPS system
      into a file. After you select this, you're presented with a
      file dialog for selecting the output file name. If you select
      the name of a file that already exists, it will be removed
      before output starts. Every RPS input after you select a file
      name will be written to that file, and the menu choice will
      change to "Stop CSV Export...". Select that menu choice to
      stop the logging and ensure that the last lines have been
      written out.</p>
