      The RPS Receiver Control window lets you update and examine
      the <a href=
      "../../../../../html/hardware/rps/index.shtml">RPS
      system</a>'s information about where its receivers are
      located.

      <p>Usually the RPS system will detect how many receivers it
      has and set up the table with the right number of rows. You
      can change that by changing the number of receivers in the
      text bus and clicking "Set".</p>

      <p>Once you have the right number of receivers defined, enter
      each one's X, Y and Z coordinates in the table.</p>

      <p>There's also a checkbox for each receiver that controls
      whether it will be used in position calculations (if checked)
      or ignored (not checked).</p>

      <p>The values "Min Time" and "Max Time" columns are used to
      decide if the receivers time measurement should be used in a
      particular calculation. These can usually be left at their
      default values of -1 and 99999 respectively, in which case
      the program will always attempt to use the receivers
      measurement. If you're having trouble, for example with
      echoes that make very long measurements (high time values)
      inaccurate, you can set a high limit, above which the
      measurement won't be used. You can similarly set a low limit
      if very small time measurements (short distances or certain
      forms of interference) turn out to be inaccurate.</p>

      <p>To help determine those limits, the most recent time
      measurement for each receiver is shown in the "Last Time"
      column of the table.</p>

      <p>By default, the RPS system measures position in inches and
      time in microseconds. If you'd prefer to use some other
      distance unit, such as meters or feet, you change the number
      used for the speed of sound. Typical values are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Inches</dt>

        <dd>0.01345</dd>

        <dt>Feet</dt>

        <dd>0.00112</dd>

        <dt>Meters</dt>

        <dd>0.000345</dd>

        <dt>cm</dt>

        <dd>0.0345</dd>
      </dl>If you change this value, be sure to click the "Set"
      box.

      <p>The "offset" value should usually be left unchanged.</p>

      <p>To save the values as the new defaults, which will be used
      the next time the program is started, click the "Set
      Defaults" button.</p>

      <p>To save the values in a separate file, click "Store...",
      then select where you want to put the file and what you want
      to call it.</p>

      <p>To load values from a previously stored file, click
      "Load..." and select the file.</p>
