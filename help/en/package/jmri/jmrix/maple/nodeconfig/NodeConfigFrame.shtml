      <h2>JMRI: Maple Node Configuration</h2>

      <h3>Background Information:</h3>

      <p>Maple Systems makes touch screen HMI (Human Machine
      Interface) panels that can have application to model
      railroading. In particular, these touch screen HMI panels can
      serve as hi-tech substitutes for fascia panels on a model
      railroad layout. This Maple-to-JMRI implementation supports
      multiple identical HMI panels that can be plugged in at
      various locations around the layout and used to control and
      display items related to that location. Each HMI panel has a
      built-in microcomputer that can be programmed (using a
      programming package supplied by Maple Systems) to display any
      number of user selectable displays. It is envisioned that
      after plugging in his/her panel, the model railroader will
      select that display appropriate to his/her current location,
      allowing the panel to serve as a communication device
      directly into JMRI. After completing tasks at a location, the
      model railroader will unplug the panel and move with it to
      another location, etc. Multiple HMI panels operating
      simultaneously are supported.</p>

      <p>The "coil bits" in the Maple HMI panels are used to
      communicate with JMRI. In this Maple-to-JMRI implementation,
      all panels use the same address space and have exactly the
      same input and output bit assignments. The first 1000 coil
      bits are reserved for configuration as Sensors. Sensors are
      referred to as "Input Bits" and are used to set JMRI Sensors
      according to status bits (coil bits) in your Maple HMI
      panels. Therefore, Sensors pass information from configured
      HMI panels to JMRI. The next 8000 bits are reserved for
      assignment as "Output Bits" and are used to send the current
      settings of Turnouts and Lights to the Maple Panels.</p>

      <h3>Communication between JMRI and Maple HMI Panels</h3>

      <p>Maple communications work by polling. Each panel is polled
      separately, and the results of the polls are ORed together to
      set Sensors. Therefore if a Sensor is ACTIVE (Maple "1") in
      any panel, it is set ACTIVE in JMRI. If a Sensor is INACTIVE
      (Maple "0") in all configured panels, then it is set INACTIVE
      in JMRI. Panels are polled in the order that they are
      configured. <b>Note:</b> The Maple poll command allows a
      maximum of 99 bits to be requested with each poll command, so
      if more than 99 input bits are configured, multiple poll
      commands will be needed for each panel.</p>

      <p>After all panels have been polled, the status of output
      bits is sent to the panels. Output bits are sent in
      "Broadcast Mode" so all panels can receive the bits at the
      same time. Broadcast Mode is indicated by an HMI Station
      Address of "0". Output bits begin with an HMI coil bit
      address of "1001". All configured output bits are sent,
      regardless of if the bit is assigned or not. <b>Note:</b> The
      Maple write command allows a maximum of 99 bits to be written
      with each transmit command, so if more than 99 output bits
      are configured, multiple transmit commands will be needed.
      Keeping the number of configured output bits as low as
      reasonable will reduce the number of transmit commands that
      must be sent.</p>

      <h3>Configuring a new Maple Panel</h3>

      <p>A new Maple Panel (a "Maple Node") is configured by
      specifying its HMI Station Address, specifying timeout times
      for polls and sends, entering the number of input and output
      bits, and clicking the <b>Add Panel</b> button. HMI Station
      Address is unique to each HMI panel, the other items are the
      same for all panels. Each item is described below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>HMI Station Address</b> - This is the address used
        by JMRI to poll the panel. Each panel must have a different
        HMI Station Address. Addresses of 1 through 99 are allowed.
        The addresses need not be consecutive. Panels need not be
        configured in numerical order.</li>

        <li><b>Poll Reply Timeout Time</b> - This is the time
        (milliseconds) to wait for a response after issuing a poll
        command before going on to the next command in the
        communication process. The value displayed is the current
        timeout time, or, if this is the first panel to be
        configured, the default timeout time. Changing it will
        change the timeout time for all panels. This time should be
        set to the smallest number that gives reliable
        communications between the computer and JMRI. <b>Note:</b>
        When a panel is configured, but not plugged in (not
        communicating), it will timeout. This is the expected
        behavior when a user is moving a panel between
        locations.</li>

        <li><b>Send Delay Time</b> - This is the time
        (milliseconds) to wait after issuing a broadcast write
        command before going on to the next command in the
        communication process. The value displayed is the current
        send delay time, or, if this is the first panel to be
        configured, the default send delay time. Changing it will
        change the send delay time for all panels.</li>

        <li><b>Number of Input Bits</b> - This is the number of
        input bits that will be polled when each HMI panel is
        polled. Values of 1 through 1000 are allowed. The number of
        input bits is forced to be the same for each panel, so if
        this number is changed when adding or editing any panel, it
        is changed for all panels. Because of the 99 bit limit in
        Maple polling requests, multiple poll commands will be
        required if this number is greater than 99. So keeping this
        number to the lowest reasonable value will result in faster
        communications.</li>

        <li><b>Number of Output Bits</b> - This is the number of
        output bits that will be sent in broadcast mode at the end
        of each polling cycle. Values of 1 through 8000 are
        allowed. The number of output bits is forced to be the same
        for each panel, so if this number is changed when adding or
        editing any panel, it is changed for all panels. Because of
        the 99 bit limit in Maple write commands, multiple write
        commands will be required if this number is greater than
        99. So keeping this number to the lowest reasonable value
        will result in faster communications.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Important:</b> Always check the messages in the
      <b>Notes</b> box after each operation! That's where success
      or errors will be reported.</p>

      <p><b>Very Important:</b> Remember to save your Maple Panel
      Node configuration information to disk after making changes.
      Use the <b>Save</b> button at the bottom of the Preferences
      window.</p>

      <h3>Other Operations</h3>

      <p>To change any of the four common parameters (poll reply
      timeout time, send delay time, number of input bits, and/or
      number of output bits), enter the HMI Station Address of any
      configured panel, click Edit Panel, make the desired
      parameter changes, and click <b>Update Panel</b>. This
      changes the parameter(s) in all configured panels.</p>

      <p>To see a list of the HMI Station Addresses of all
      configured panels, select <b>List Assignments</b> in the
      <b>Maple</b> menu, and pull down the <b>Nodes</b> popup
      menu.</p>

      <p>To change the HMI Station Address of a previously
      configured panel, enter the HMI Station Address of the panel,
      click <b>Delete Panel</b>, confirm the deletion, enter the
      new HMI Station Address, and click <b>Add Panel</b>. HMI
      Station Addresses cannot be changed via Edit.</p>

      <p>If you add a Sensor with a system name that addresses a
      coil bit beyond the configured number of input bits, the
      Sensor will be added, and a <b>Configuration Warning</b>
      message will be issued. There is no way to access a Sensor
      that corresponds to an HMI coil bit outside the range of
      configured bits. So if you get a <b>Configuration Warning</b>
      message, you should either change your configuration's
      <b>Number of Input Bits</b> or delete the Sensor.</p>

      <p>If you add a Turnout with a system name that addresses a
      coil bit outside the configured range of output bits, the
      Turnout will be added, and a <b>Configuration Warning</b>
      message will be issued. The configured range of HMI bit
      addresses is 1001 through 1000 + the number of output bits,
      corresponding to JMRI addresses of 1 through the number of
      output bits. There is no way to write to a Turnout that
      corresponds to an HMI coil bit outside the range of
      configured bits. So if you get a <b>Configuration Warning</b>
      message, you should either change your configuration's
      <b>Number of Output Bits</b> or delete the Turnout.</p>

      <p>JMRI will refuse to create a Light if it doesn't
      correspond to the configured address range for output bits
      (see above).</p>
