      <h2>JMRI: Maple Input and Output Assignments</h2>

      <p>This tool lets you display Sensor, Turnout and Light assignments for your Maple Panels and
      match them to Maple HMI Panel addresses.</p>

      <p>On Maple, the coil bits in the Maple HMI's are used to communicate with JMRI. The first
      1000 coil bits are reserved for Sensors--these are referred to as "Input Bits" and are used
      to set JMRI Sensors. Sensors pass information from the HMI panels to JMRI. The next 8000 bits
      are reserved for "Output Bits" and are used to send the current settings of Turnouts and
      Lights to the Maple Panels.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Node</strong> popup menu at the top of the display allows the user to see the
      HMI Station Address of all Maple panels that are currently configured. Since all panels use
      the same addresses, selecting a specific panel does not change the information displayed. The
      number of configured input and output bits is also displayed.</p>

      <p>Choose between displaying input or output bits by selecting either <strong>Show Input
      Bits</strong> or <strong>Show Output Bits</strong> at the top of the display. JMRI bit number
      and the corresponding Maple HMI coil bit address are displayed for each configured bit. The
      JMRI System Name and the JMRI User Name is displayed if the bit has a JMRI assignment. Bits
      that do not display a JMRI System Name are configured and are available for assignment.</p>

      <p><strong>Background Information:</strong> In this Maple to JMRI implementation, all panels
      have exactly the same input and output bit assignments. Output bits are sent in "Broadcast
      Mode" so all panels can see the settings. Each panel is polled separately, and the results of
      the polls are ORed together to set Sensors. Therefore if a Sensor is ACTIVE (Maple "1") in
      any panel, it is set ACTIVE. If a Sensor is INACTIVE (Maple "0") in all configured panels,
      then it is set INACTIVE.</p>
