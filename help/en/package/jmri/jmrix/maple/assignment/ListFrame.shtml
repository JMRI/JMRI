      <h2>JMRI: Maple Input and Output Assignments</h2>

      <p>This tool lets you display Sensor, Turnout and Light
      assignments for your Maple Panels and match them to Maple HMI
      Panel addresses.</p>

      <p>On Maple, the coil bits in the Maple HMI's are used to
      communicate with JMRI. The first 1000 coil bits are reserved
      for Sensors--these are referred to as "Input Bits" and are
      used to set JMRI Sensors. Sensors pass information from the
      HMI panels to JMRI. The next 8000 bits are reserved for
      "Output Bits" and are used to send the current settings of
      Turnouts and Lights to the Maple Panels.</p>

      <p>The <b>Node</b> popup menu at the top of the display
      allows the user to see the HMI Station Address of all Maple
      panels that are currently configured. Since all panels use
      the same addresses, selecting a specific panel does not
      change the information displayed. The number of configured
      input and output bits is also displayed.</p>

      <p>Choose between displaying input or output bits by
      selecting either <b>Show Input Bits</b> or <b>Show Output
      Bits</b> at the top of the display. JMRI bit number and the
      corresponding Maple HMI coil bit address are displayed for
      each configured bit. The JMRI System Name and the JMRI User
      Name is displayed if the bit has a JMRI assignment. Bits that
      do not display a JMRI System Name are configured and are
      available for assignment.</p>

      <p><b>Background Information:</b> In this Maple to JMRI
      implementation, all panels have exactly the same input and
      output bit assignments. Output bits are sent in "Broadcast
      Mode" so all panels can see the settings. Each panel is
      polled separately, and the results of the polls are ORed
      together to set Sensors. Therefore if a Sensor is ACTIVE
      (Maple "1") in any panel, it is set ACTIVE. If a Sensor is
      INACTIVE (Maple "0") in all configured panels, then it is set
      INACTIVE.</p><!--#include virtual="/Footer" -->
