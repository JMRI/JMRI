      <h2>Monitor Maple Traffic</h2>

      <p>This window allows you to monitor communication between your Maple panels and your
      computer, so you can see what is happening as JMRI sends information to and receives
      information from your Maple System. You can save this information to a log file for
      troubleshooting purposes.</p>

      <p><strong>Background Information:</strong> On Maple, the coil bits in the Maple HMI's are
      used to communicate with JMRI. In this Maple-to-JMRI implementation, all panels use the same
      address space and have exactly the same input and output bit assignments. The first 1000 coil
      bits are reserved for configuration as Sensors. Sensors are referred to as "Input Bits" and
      are used to set JMRI Sensors according to status bits in your Maple HMI panels. Therefore,
      Sensors pass information from configured HMI panels to JMRI. The next 8000 bits are reserved
      for assignment as "Output Bits" and are used to send the current settings of Turnouts and
      Lights to the Maple Panels.</p>
      Maple communications work by polling. Each panel is polled separately, and the results of the
      polls are ORed together to set Sensors. Therefore if a Sensor is ACTIVE (Maple "1") in any
      panel, it is set ACTIVE. If a Sensor is INACTIVE (Maple "0") in all configured panels, then
      it is set INACTIVE. The panels are polled in the order that they are configured.
      <strong>Note:</strong> The Maple poll command only allows a maximum of 99 bits to be read
      with each poll command, so if more than 99 input bits are configured, you will see multiple
      poll commands for each panel.
      <p>After all panels have been polled, the status of output bits is sent to the panels. Output
      bits are sent in "Broadcast Mode" so all panels can receive the bits at the same time.
      Broadcast Mode is indicated by an HMI Station Address of "0". Output bits begin with HMI coil
      bit address of "1001". All configured output bits are sent, regardless of if the bit is
      assigned or not. <strong>Note:</strong> The Maple write command only allows a maximum of 99
      bits to be written with each transmit command, so if more than 99 output bits are configured,
      you will see multiple transmit commands, with starting addresses increasing by 99 in
      each.</p>
