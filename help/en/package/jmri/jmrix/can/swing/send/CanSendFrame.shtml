      <p>The "Send CAN Frame" tool lets you directly send <a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/can/index.shtml">CAN frames</a>.</p>

      <p>The top section of the window lets you send a single frame, the bottom section acts as a
      frame sequencer.</p>

      <p>You can enter packets in <a href=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/can/cbus/Names.shtml">CBUS® address format</a>, e.g. "+1",
      "-2" or "+n4e1" ( decimal, without the quotation marks ).<br>
      Once you've entered the packet, just click "send" or press Enter.</p>

      <p>You can enter the packet's data contents as hexadecimal numbers, for example "83 7C".</p>

      <p>Any spaces in the packets will be removed before sending.</p>

      <p>If you want to specify header contents, precede the packet data with the header in "( )"
      characters or "[ ]" characters for a standard or extended header, respectively.</p>

      <p>This tool works well in combination with the <a href=
      "../../cbus/swing/console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml">CBUS Console</a>, where the actual frames
      generated and received can be viewed.</p>

      <p>If a message is unable to be created, a popup dialogue box will notify you.</p>

      <p>Remember, if sending out messages to a live CBUS network, these will be received and acted
      upon accordingly!</p>

      <h2 id="sequencer">Sequencer</h2>
      <img src="../../../../../../html/hardware/can/images/can-send-can-frame-sequence-352x393.gif"
      width="352" height="393" alt="JMRI CBUS Send Frame Tool Sequencer" class="floatRight">
      <p>The bottom section lets you enter from one to four frames that will be repeatedly sent in
      sequence, with user-defined delays in between.</p>

      <p>Press the "Go" button to start the transmission sequence, and press it again to stop the
      sequence.</p>

      <p>You can alter the messages while it is running, those changes take effect the next time
      the frame is called in the sequence.</p>

      <p>The last frame to have been sent in the sequence is highlighted by a different background
      colour.</p>

      <p>You will be notified if the sequencer is unable to send a can frame.</p>

      <h2>Options</h2>

      <p>CBUS priority - Adds a priority to the message header.</p>

      <p>Send as outgoing CanMessage - Sends as if message originating from JMRI ( selected by
      default ).</p>

      <p>Send as outgoing CanMessage - Sends as if message originating from outside of JMRI</p>
