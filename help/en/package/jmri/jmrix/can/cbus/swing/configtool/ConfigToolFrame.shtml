      <p>The MERG CBUS Event Capture tool can simplify configuring JMRI
      to work well with your <a href=
      "../../../../../../../html/hardware/can/cbus/index.shtml">CBUS</a>
      installation.</p>

      <p>To <a href=
      "../../../../../../../html/hardware/can/cbus/index.shtml">configure
      JMRI Sensors, Turnouts and Lights</a>, you need to identify the
      associated MERG CBUS events. There are several ways to do this.</p>
      
      <p>This page uses the capture tool to configure a Sensor as an example, 
      similar methods work for Turnouts and Lights.</p>

     <h3><a name="examinemultipleevents" id="examinemultipleevents" 
     >Examine Multiple Events</a></h3>
      <p>The upper part of the screen
      can capture multiple MERG CBUS Events, which you can then use to
      create Sensors and Turnouts.

      <p>When a new MERG CBUS message comes it, it will be captured in
      the highest line that has the "Capture" box checked. The box
      will then be unchecked so the captured message is not
      overwritten by later MERG CBUS messages. If you check a series of
      boxes, you can capture a series of messages.</p>

      <p>Once you've captured the Event you want, you can copy and
      paste it into the boxes in the lower part of the window. If
      your computer allows it, you can also just drag and drop the
      value into the lower field.</p>
      
      
     <h3><a name="eventid" id="eventid">Manually enter the Event ID</a></h3>
      <p>You can just type an <a href=
      "../../../../../../../html/hardware/can/cbus/index.shtml">Event
      ID</a> in the field next to "Active On", and then press
      "Create". A Sensor / Turnout / Light will be created that goes Active when the
      Event is seen, and Inactive when the opposite Event (ON vs
      OFF) is seen.</p>

      <p>If you want to associate Active and Inactive with
      completely separate Events, you can enter the Event IDs in
      the two fields and click "Create".</p>


     <h3><a name="capturenextevent" id="capturenextevent"
     >Capture the Next Event</a></h3>
      <p>If you can make the layout
      emit the desired Event, for example by pressing a fascia
      switch or throwing a turnout, you can capture that Event and
      use it.</p>

      <p>If you press the "Capture Next" button next to one of the
      Event fields, it will stay down (activated) until the next
      MERG CBUS Event (CAN frame) is seen by the program. That Event is
      captured into the neighboring field for later use.</p>

      <p>You can separately capture the two Events for a Sensor,
      Turnout or Light if desired.</p>


     <h3><a name="filterhighlight" id="filterhighlight"
     >Filtering and Highlighting</a></h3>
      <p>You can open up a new 
      <a href="../console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml#filter">filter</a> or 
      <a href="../console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml#highlighter">event highlighter</a>
      window by clicking on the buttons at top of the screen.
        </p>

      <p>You can also open the Capture Tool via the 
      <a href="../console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml">Console Log</a>.
      <br>In this case, the filter and event highlighter used by 
      the console log will be shared with the capture tool.
      </p>

    <p>Any windows opened this way can be identified by the title.</p>  
      

    <h3>JMRI Help</h3>
    
      <p>Once you've created a MERG CBUS Sensor or
      Turnout, you can use the <a href=
      "../../../../../jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor
      Table</a>, <a href=
      "../../../../../jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout
      Table</a> or <a href=
      "../../../../../jmrit/beantable/LightTable.shtml">Light
      Table</a> to adjust the details.</p>

      <p>The <a href="../console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml">MERG CBUS
      Console</a> can help you figure out what events are happening
      on your layout.</p>
      
      <p>You can view this help page within JMRI by selecting Help > Window Help in the top bar of the MERG CBUS Event Capture window.</p>
