      <h1>JMRI: MERGCBUS Event Table</h1><a href=
      "../../../../../../../html/hardware/can/images/CbusEventTable_963x276.png"><img src="../../../../../../../html/hardware/can/images/CbusEventTable_963x276.png"
      width="963" height="276" alt="Event Table Screen" align=
      "right"></a>

      <p>The MERGCBUS Event Table displays event information on your <a href=
      "../../../../../../../html/hardware/can/cbus/index.shtml">CBUS</a>
      connection.</p>
      
      <p>Both incoming to JMRI and outgoing messages are logged to the table.</p>

      <p>While the window is open, it will maintain a list of short on / off events, long on / off events, extended OPC on / off events, on / off accessory response events.</p>

      
      <p>Each event and node combination is unique, the maximum event number is 65,535.</p>
      <p>The maximum node number is also 65,535.</p>
      
      <p>The table will always start with no entries, data is not maintained between sessions.</p>
      

      <p>Short event codes will be stripped of any node number contained within the event CAN message.</p>
      <p>All numeric values decimal.</p>

      
      <p>The filter will highlight any text entered, you can use and spaces in the search field.
      <br>The table will then only show events which contain the search phrase.
      <br>Text in the information panel at the bottom of the event table will also be highlighted.</p>
      

    <h3>Columns</h3>
    <img src="../../../../../../../html/hardware/can/images/CbusEventTable_Columns_123x318.png"
      width="123" height="318" alt="Event Table Screen" align=
      "right">
      
        <p>The order can be rearranged by dragging the column header. </p>
        <p>Right click in the header to select a list of columns to display.</p>
        <p>Change the column sort order by left clicking on the column header.</p>
      
    <h4>Event, Node, </h4>
        <p>Event or device number reported within an event CAN message.</p>
        <p>Node number reported by an event CAN message.</p>
        
    <h4>On or Off</h4>
        <p>Last reported, current state of event, On or Off.</p>
    
    <h4>Send On / Send Off / Toggle</h4>
        <p>Send an on or off event. If the the event has a node number, this will be a long event otherwise short.</p>
        <p>Toggle: If event last reported state is currently on, sends an off event and vice versa.</p>
        
    <h4>Event Name and Comment</h4>
        <p>Editable event name and comments.</p>
        <p>Node name only active when using imported events. </p>
        
    <h4>CAN ID</h4>
      <p>The last CAN ID heard by the event.</p>
      

      
    <h4>On / Off / In / Out / Total Session</h4>
      <p>Running total on events.</p>
      <p>Running total off events.</p>
      <p>Running total events sent by JMRI.</p>
      <p>Running total events received by JMRI.</p>
      <p>Total events.</p>      
      
      
    <h4>Last Heard</h4>      
        <p>Time + datestamp of the last time the event was heard. </p>
      
      

      
    <h4>Get Status Button</h4>  
      <p>On clicking, JMRI sends an event accessory status request message 
      to the network, long if the event has a node, short if without.</p>
      <p>This triggers a JMRI event listener which awaits a response 
      from the event, either a request response or a normal event 
      is accepted as a response.</p>
      <p>If nothing is set in event feedback, the default timeout is 
      5 seconds from the same event and node combination.</p>
      <p>Some users may want to create a new JMRI turnout, sensor or light 
      to represent the get status button and send the event request status message.
      
      <br>The hardware addresses for these request events would look something like:</p>
      
      <table border="1">
      <tbody>
      <tr>
      <th>Hardware Address</th>
      <th>Ops Code Hex</th>
      <th>Ops Code Translated</th>
      <th>Node Dec</th>
      <th>Event Dec</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>X9A0000007B</td>
      <td>9A</td>
      <td>Accessory Request Short</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>123</td>
      </tr>      
      <tr>
      <td>X92007B01C8</td>
      <td>92</td>
      <td>Accessory Request Long</td>
      <td>123</td>
      <td>456</td>
      </tr>  
      </tbody>
      </table>
      
      <p>There are a few methods within JMRI of sending this event to ping every few seconds, one being to create a jython script to ping 1 sensor every few seconds, and use logix on this 1 sensor to create other ping event status requests outputs.</p>

      <p>When an event response request message is heard on the network, the event table will listen for event feedback.</p>
      
      
    <h4>Event Feedback</h4>  
      

      <p>When an event is sent by JMRI 
      which has a number in the feedback response column,
      the event table will listen for its response and warn if this is not received.
      </p>
      
      <p>The system will listen for a feedback event in the 
      form of a response event, or a normal on off event.
      The response events do not have to status ( on or off ) match, 
      and can be any of the data lengths.</p>    
      
      <p>JMRI core does not currently act on response events.</p>
      
      <p>FB Status - Status of the very last feedback request.</p>
      
      <p>FB reqiured - Number of response events required to prove.<br>
      Unavailable if FB Event or Node number is set.</p>


      <p>FB Outstanding - How many feedback events are currently outstanding.</p> 
      
      <p>FB Timeout - ms before alerts set in.<br>
      Unavailable if FB Event or node numbers set.</p>
      
      
      <p>FB Event - If this particular event is feedback for another event, 
      include that other event number.
      <br>Only available when FB Required, timeout o</p>
      
      <p>FB Node - If this particular event is feedback for another event, 
      include that  event node number.</p>
       
        
      <h4>Delete Event</h4>
      <p>Delete event from this table after confirmation, option to disable further confirmatiions.</p>
      <p>The event will be re-added to the table if re-heard on the network.</p>      
      

    <h3>Printing and Export / Import</h3>
    
      <p>You can start the table by adding it to your JMRI startup action list.
      <br>PanelPro > Edit Preferences > Start Up > Add > Perform Action > Open CBUS Event Table.
      </p>
      
      
      

    <p>From the File menu, choose Export to open file save dialog and save
        the contents of the table in a CSV (comma separated values) text file.</p>
        
        <p>Choose the Print (Preview) menu to create a
        hard copy of the Event Table.</p>

        <p>The events are not currently maintained between sessions.</p>
      
        <p>It is not currently possible to load previous session data into the table from file.</p>

        <p>You can import event and node numbers, names and their node names from a FCU config file.</p>
      
      <p>The FCU config file may well contain multiple copies of the event,
      ( for teaching to different nodes ), so only the 1st unique event and node number 
      found in the file is added.</p>
      
      <p>An event name within the file will be added to an existing table entry if it has no event name.</p>
      
      
    <h3>JMRI Help</h3>
      
      <p>You can view this help page within JMRI by selecting Help > Window Help in the top bar of the MERG Event Table window.</p>
      
      <p>The <a href="../console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml">CBUS
      Console</a> can help you figure out what events are happening
      on your layout.</p>
