      <p>JMRI provides a communications monitor window so you can
      see what's happening on the communications link between the
      program and the layout CBUS.</p>

      <p>Once you open a CBUS Monitor window, it will automatically
      display all traffic on the link in the two sections at the
      top of the window.<br>
      The left part contains the raw CAN frames. The right part
      interprets their CBUS meaning.</p>

      <h2>Logging To A File</h2>Sometimes, it's helpful to capture
      what's happening. For example, you might encounter a bug
      (!!), and want to send a copy of what's happening to the
      people who are trying to fix it.

      <p>Small amounts of data can be copied from the log window
      with your computers "copy" command (e.g. ctrl-C or cmd-C),
      and then pasted into an email.</p>

      <p>If you want to capture more, you can have the window write
      a log file on your computer's disk. To do this:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Click "Choose log file". A file-chooser window will
        open. Navigate to where you want to store the file, enter a
        name for the new log file, and click "Save". Note that if
        you pick a file that already exists, it will be
        overwritten.</li>

        <li>When you're ready to capture the data you want, click
        "Start logging" on the monitor window.</li>

        <li>When you're done, click "Stop logging" to store the
        data and close the file.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Buttons</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>Clear Screen</dt>

        <dd>Erases the log area at the top of the screen.</dd>

        <dt>Freeze Screen</dt>

        <dd>Stops acquiring new information, so that the captured
        information stops scrolling up.</dd>

        <dt>Show timestamps</dt>

        <dd>Normally, the program just displays the data from the
        communication link. If you'd like each message to be
        preceded by the time it was sent or received, check this
        box.</dd>

        <dt>Show priorities</dt>

        <dd>If you'd like each message to be preceded by the CBUS
        priorities used in sending the message, check this
        box.</dd>

        <dt>Add Message</dt>

        <dd>If you'd like to annotate the message log with your own
        comments, Enter a comment and click the Add message
        button.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Packet Statistics</h2>This part of the window shows the
      number of CBUS packets received and transmitted and controls
      the format of the display.

      <h3>Buttons</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>Clear</dt>

        <dd>Resets the packet counts to zero.</dd>

        <dt>Decimal Data Entry/Display</dt>

        <dd>Normally, the Console window displays data in
        hexadecimal and treats data entered as hexadecimal. To
        change the default to decimal, check this box.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Most Recently Received Packet</h2>This displays the most
      recent packet received from the layout. The individual
      elements displayed are dynamic and minor priority, the first
      data byte which is the CBUS opcode and the remaining, up to
      seven, data bytes.

        width="471" height="287" alt="Expanded Console Tool Screen showing Events and other options"
        align="right"></a>

      <h3>Buttons</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>Copy</dt>

        <dd>Copies the most recently received packet into the send
        packet data fields.</dd>
      </dl><a name="cbusSend" id="cbusSend"></a>

      <h1>Send Event</h1>
      <p>At the bottom part of the Console, you can construct an Event
      packet to be sent to the layout. For normal operation, do not
      edit the preloaded values in the dynamic and normal priority
      fields.<br>
      Enter the opcode and the correct number of data bytes
      (depending upon the opcode).</p>

      <p>If the decimal data entry/display checkbox is not selected
      then data entry will, by default, be treated as hexadecimal.
      If the decimal data entry/display checkbox is selected then
      data entry will, by default, be treated as hexadecimal.</p>

      <p>At any time, you may force data entered to be treated as
      hexadecimal, decimal or binary by adding a "0x", "0d" or "0b"
      prefix. For example "0x20", "0d32" and "0b00100000" all
      donate a decimal value of 32.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when the decimal data entry/display checkbox
      is not selected (hexadecimal mode), any value with three or
      more digits will be treated as binary. When the decimal data
      entry/display checkbox is selected (decimal mode), any value
      with four or more digits will be treated as binary.</p>

      <h3>Buttons</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>Send</dt>

        <dd>Checks the packet entered and sends it to the layout or
        reports any error condition detected (e.g. the number of
        data bytes does not match the opcode).</dd>

        <dt>Clear</dt>

        <dd>Clears the data entry fields and preloads the priority
        values.</dd>
