    <h1>OpenLCB Event Table Frame</h1>
      <a href="Event_Table.png">
      This provides a table view of the Events, Producers and Consumers
      in your OpenLCB network.
      <p>
        <img src="Event_Table.png" width="1237" height="425""/></a>
     <p>
      The primary purpose of the Event Table is three fold:
    <ul>
    <li>Display the Events used on your OpenLCB network along with all of their related
    Producers and Consumers.
    This is created initially in real time through a query of the actual nodes on your
    network and supplemented by any additional information available to JMRI at the time,
    most usefully open node configuration dialog windows (displaying the node's CDI)
    and JMRI data such as User names from the Turnout or Sensor tables.
    As you open and close the configuration dialog windows for additional nodes,
    these contributions will be added and removed from the Event table in real time.
    For the most complete view of your network's Events and Consumer/Producer relationships,
    open the configuration dialog windows for all of your nodes however you may find
    it more manageable to open just the subset of nodes relevant to your task at hand.
    If the information from all node configuration dialogs are to be considered,
    on a large network open these windows prior to the Event Table for the
    fastest initial response. This information is not retained between sessions.
    <p>
    <li>Apply User names to Events.
    Similar to the use of User defined names in the Turnout or Sensor Tables,
    the Event Table allows you to apply names to Events that are more meaningful as
    to their purpose than just the Event ID itself.
    The Event's user assigned name is retained between sessions and is also shown in the
    OpenLCB Traffic Monitor as an additional aid when the Event box is checked therein.
    <p>
    <li>Provide a document record of your Events and their Consumer and Producer relationships.
    Exported as a *.csv file and then viewed and manipulated through a suitable program like Excel,
    this provides a reference or documentation of all of the Event IDs and their associated
    Consumer/Producer relationships as known by JMRI at the time of the export.
    This document can also be used as a reference source of Event IDs that
    may be cut & pasted into a node configuration dialog as you build additional
    Consumer/Producer relationships on your network.
    This is the same data as displayed in the Event Table at the time of the export
    so the more information available, the more complete the export.
    It is envisioned that the user re-export this reference documentation regularly
    as the network evolves rather than try to maintain the resulting document independently.
    </ul>
      <p>
      You can resize and sort the columns using the header row.
      <p>
      Pressing the "Update from Network" button will load the table from the network.
      This might take a couple seconds.  You should press it again
      after changes like adding nodes, changing their configuration, etc.
      The table cannot detect those changes automatically.
      <p>
      If node names (4th and 6th columns) don't show up immediately, press
      "Update from Network" a second time.
      <p>
      If you have a configuration window open on one or more events and
      click "Update from Network", the right-hand column will show the
      tree-walking display of where each event is referenced in those
      configuration windows.  This can help you determine the function of
      the producers and consumers. You might need to resize the column
      to see the complete entry.
      <p>
      Note that the "Update from Network" button does a "Verify Events" operation
      on the network.  Some nodes consider this to be a start-of-day, power-up
      operation and might change the status of their outputs due to that.
      <p>
      You can enter names for events in the 2nd column.  Click on the cell
      to open it for editing. Hit return when done.  These will be
      saved automatically and loaded when you next start JMRI.
      <p>
      Checking the "Require label" box will display only events with labels.
      This lets you ignore events that you haven't labeled as interesting.
      <p>
      Checking the "Require both producer(s) and consumer(s)" box will
      display only those events that have both at least one producer
      and at least one consumer.  These are the events that actually do something
      on your LCC network.
      <p>
      Checking the "Popcorn mode" will highlight the producer for every event that
      JMRI sees being produced.
      Since the window scrolls to show the event, this can result in the screen
      jumping around when it's enabled.
      If there's a lot of traffic, this can slow your
      computer down significantly, so only enable it when you want to use it.
      <p>
      Entering an event ID in the find box and clicking "Find" will highlight every
      occurrence of that event.  The window will scroll to show the first one if needed.
