        This lets you get the contents of a specific memory space in
        a node and place it into a binary file. It also lets you
        read a binary file and put it into a specific memory space
        in a node.

        <p>
        Hopefully, most of the controls are self-explanatory.

        <p>
        The "Trust Status Info" checkbox is normally checked. OpenLCB
        defines a message to get the length of an address space which
        the tool uses to determine how much data to get. Some nodes
        don't reply to this message or give a wrong value.  In that
        case, you can uncheck the box and rely solely error checking
        to determine the amount of data returned from the node.

        <p>
        Be careful when putting data back to a node.  This tool
        doesn't make any checks on whether the data is valid for that
        node. If you load an invalid file, you might badly mess up
        the node, up to and including bricking it.

        <p>
        You can use the "Configuration" option under the "Supported Protocols"
        item in the
        <a href="../networktree/NetworkTreePane.shtml">Configure Nodes tool</a>.
