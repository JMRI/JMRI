      <h2 id="General">General information</h2>

      <p>Some OpenLCB devices allow users to update the firmware
      (internal program) via the OpenLCB connection. The OpenLCB
      Download Firmware tool provides a mechanism to perform
      updates via an OpenLCB connection.</p>

      <p>This tool supports firmware update files distributed in
      ".hex" file format (sometimes referred to as the <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX">Intel "I8HEX" file
      format</a>).</p>

      <p>The tool automatically determines how to interpret the
      firmware update and performs a number of file and data
      integrity checks before the update information can be used.
      If any issues are identified in the firmware file, the user
      is informed and the tool will not allow the user to update
      the device with what could be erroneous firmware
      information.</p>

      <h2 id="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

      <p><strong>This tool is capable of modifying the firmware in
      OpenLCB devices in ways that could make the devices
      inoperable.</strong> The developers of this tool have
      attempted to reduce the chances that the tool would corrupt a
      OpenLCB device's firmware. <strong>We cannot guarantee that
      there is no risk of corrupting device firmware when using
      this tool.</strong> It is impossible for the tool developers
      to predict every way of using the tool and it is impossible
      to predict the nuances of various devices, firmware files,
      computer operating systems, computer-to-OpenLCB interface
      hardware, etc.</p>

      <p>In cases where a firmware update attempt does not apply
      properly, it is often possible to <a href="#Problem">re-apply
      the firmware update to the device</a> to restore proper
      device functionality. This has been recommended by at least
      one OpenLCB device manufacturer and has been found to be
      effective in some cases by the developers of this tool.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Use this tool at your own
      risk.</strong></em></p>

      <h2 id="Updating">Updating Device Firmware Contents</h2>To
      use this tool to update a OpenLCB device's firmware:

      <ul>
        <li>Consult the device manufacturer to determine if the
        device supports user updates of firmware.</li>

        <li>Acquire the appropriate firmware file from the device
        manufacturer.</li>

        <li>The device being updated must be plugged into a live
        OpenLCB connection. If the device can be battery powered,
        ensure that the batteries are good before starting this
        process. If the device uses an external power supply,
        ensure that it is powered and attached.</li>

        <li>Some devices may require changes to jumpers or DIP
        switch settings, and perhaps require removal and
        restoration of power, in order to allow the device to
        accept the firmware update via OpenLCB. Consult the node's
        manufacturer's firmware update instructions for
        details.</li>

        <li>Open the OpenLCB Firmware Download tool by selecting
        the "Download Firmware" item from the OpenLCB menu. If you
        have more than one OpenLCB connection, you must open the
        tool from the OpenLCB menu which is associated with the
        connection which communicates with the device you wish to
        update.</li>

        <li>Click the Select button, and select the .hex file you
        want to use as the source of your firmware update. Click
        the Open button to select the file for use. The file will
        then be read and inspected for errors.

          <p>If the file is read and parsed successfully, the tool
          window will enable the "Download" button, and update the
          status message at the bottom of the window to state
          "Click Download to download new firmware".</p>

          <p>If the file cannot be read and parsed successfully, a
          pop-up message will appear or the tool window will update
          the status message at the bottom of the window with a
          description of the problem it found. For more
          information, see <a href="#ErrorMessages">Error
          Messages</a>, below.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Click the Download button to update the firmware in the
        device. This may take a few seconds or minutes, depending
        on the amount of firmware to be updated and the speed at
        which the messages are sent to the device. A progress bar
        is displayed below the "Download", "Verify", and "Abort"
        buttons to show progress of the update process. The bar
        will darken from one end to the other as the update gets
        closer to completion.</li>

        <li>Once the update tool completes its work, <em>the tool
        is unable to tell if the OpenLCB device has properly
        written the update</em>. The OpenLCB messaging used for the
        firmware update and firmware verify processes does tell
        JMRI that the node accepted the data and says it did write
        it OK, but JMRI can't actually test to see if that's true.
        Because of this limitation, the tool is only able to report
        that it has completed its work. It's possible that the node
        didn't to the programming properly.

          <p>The device may provide an indication that the update
          process has completed (or failed) using lights on the
          product or on the display of the product. Consult the
          device manufacturer's instructions for further
          information.</p>
        </li>

        <li>After performing the firmware update, it may be
        necessary to reset or remove and restore power to the
        device. Consult the manufacturer's firmware update
        instructions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="Problem">What if my device does not work correctly
      after updating the firmware?</h2>

      <p>Sometimes the device firmware update process does not
      appear to work, and the device may fail to provide its normal
      functionality. <em>Often, repeating the firmware update
      process one or more times will solve the problem.</em> This
      has been recommended by at least one OpenLCB device
      manufacturer and has been found to be effective in many cases
      by the developers of this tool.</p>

      <p>In other cases, a device may not be easily restored to
      proper operation after a firmware update attempt. In this
      case, consult the device manufacturer for further
      instructions.</p>

      <p>Consult your device documentation and, if necessary, the
      device manufacturer's technical support if your device fails
      to function properly after updating its firmware.</p>

      <h2 id="ErrorMessages">Error Messages</h2>

      <p>This tool can identify problems at two different stages of
      the firmware update process. The tool checks for problems
      within the firmware update file when reading the file. When
      the user activates the "Download" button, the tool checks the
      validity of the parameters which the user can change in the
      tool window for obvious problems. (Many download files don't
      have parameters, so this might not apply to you) If any
      issues are found at either of these stages, the tool will
      update the message at the bottom of the tool window. If a
      parameter is found to be out of range, that parameter value
      will be shown with red text instead of black text. The
      "Download" and "Verify" buttons will not perform any useful
      function if any of the parameters are invalid.</p>

      <p>Typically, when this type of pop-up window appears, a
      message in the JMRI "console" log will provide additional
      technical detail about the problem. The firmware update file
      provider may find this information useful in correcting
      firmware update file issues.</p>

      <p>The tool may also create a pop-up window under certain
      circumstances.</p>

      <h3 id="NoInputFile">"You Must Select An Input File" Pop-up
      Window</h3>

      <p>The tool will open a pop-up window with this message if
      the user uses the "Cancel" button on the file selection
      pop-up window. The tool cannot perform a firmware update if
      no firmware file is selected.</p>

      <h3 id="FileNotFound">"File Not Found" Pop-up Window</h3>

      <p>The tool will open a pop-up window if the file selected by
      the user does not exist. The pop-up window will state that
      the file was not found. Use the "Select" button to re-specify
      the correct firmware file.</p>

      <h3 id="InvalidOptionsInFile">"Invalid value for Options key"
      Pop-up Window</h3>

      <p>The tool will open a pop-up window if the file selected by
      the user contains a value for the "Options" key which is not
      supported by this tool. Consult the device manufacturer for
      advice if this occurs.</p>

      <h3 id="FileReadError">"Firmware file cannot be read." Status
      Message</h3>

      <p>This status message is shown when an abnormal event occurs
      which prevents the tool from reading the file from the disk.
      This is typically a problem with the computer or the media
      from which the file is being read.</p>

      <h3 id="ParameterValidationProblem">"Invalid parameter(s)
      above." Status Message</h3>

      <p>This message indicates that one or more of the values are
      out of range. Usually it is unnecessary for the user to
      change any of the parameter values because either the tool's
      default values are appropriate or because the firmware file
      specifies the required values. If an invalid value is found
      in one of the parameter entry fields, the invalid parameter
      will be highlighted in red. To resolve the problem, close the
      Firmware Download tool, then re-open it and re-read the file.
      Be careful not to change any of the parameter field values.
      If the tool still identifies a value as invalid, consult the
      device manufacturer.</p>

      <h3 id="nullFirmwareData">"Do not have any firmware
      information to send." Status Message</h3>

      <p>This status message indicates that the firmware file did
      not contain any valid firmware information. Consult the
      device manufacturer for a valid firmware file.</p>

      <h3 id="ContentNotUnderstood">"Firmware content in the file
      is not understood" Status message</h3>

      <p>When the tool reads a firmware file which it does not
      understand, it will show the message "Firmware content in the
      file is not understood by this reader." in the status line at
      the bottom of the tool window. Consult the device
      manufacturer for support - usually this means that the
      manufacturer must provide a new firmware file.</p><br clear=

      <h2 id="Notes">Other Notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>The tool automatically determines whether the file uses
        16-bit or 24-bit addressing. The user can't change that
        selection. This removes the possibility that the wrong
        setting could be used.</li>

        <li>It's OK to have multiple OpenLCB Firmware Download
        windows open at the same time. You can perform firmware
        updates and/or verifies to separate nodes simultaneously,
        although this will be slower than doing them one at a
        time.</li>

        <li>If the selected update file's filename is too long to
        fit the tool window, the filename will be displayed in a
        shortened form. If the cursor is placed over the displayed
        filename, the "tool tip" will attempt to show the complete
        file name.</li>
