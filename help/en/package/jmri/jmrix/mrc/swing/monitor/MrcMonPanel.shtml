      <h1>JMRI: MRC Command Monitor</h1>This is the
      package/jmri/jmrix/mrc/swing/monitor/MrcMonPanel.shtml
      package help file.

      <p><b>Include Poll Messages</b> - When enabled you will see
      the messages as each cab on the network is polled by the
      command station. This is a lot of traffic and generally shows
      that nothing meaningful is happening. It is useful to confirm
      that a cab is being polled and if the cab is responding.</p>
