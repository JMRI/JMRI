      <h1>JMRI: MRC Command Monitor</h1>
      This is the package/jmri/jmrix/mrc/swing/monitor/MrcMonPanel.shtml package help file.
      <p><strong>Include Poll Messages</strong> - When enabled you will see the messages as each
      cab on the network is polled by the command station. This is a lot of traffic and generally
      shows that nothing meaningful is happening. It is useful to confirm that a cab is being
      polled and if the cab is responding.</p>
