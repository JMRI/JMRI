                <h1>XML Error Handling</h1>
                <p>JMRI will sometimes encounter errors loading XML files including layout
                    and control panels. Some of these errors occur when loading a file
                    created in an older version of JMRI that contains data in a format no
                    longer supported or recognized by newer versions of JMRI.</p>
                <p><strong>Note</strong> It is likely that the first error encountered in
                    an XML document will prevent further errors from being reported. The
                    XML file should probably be reviewed for all errors listed below.</p>

                <h2>Fixing Errors</h2>
                <p>Generally these errors can be fixed by opening the XML file in text
                    editor. You can use the text editor included in your operating system,
                    which is often very basic, or another one downloaded from elsewhere.
                    <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> is an XML format aware editor for
                    Windows, macOS, and Linux with that can be used if needed.</p>
                <p>Most remediation recommendation in the errors list below assume an
                    ability to edit the file directly.</p>

                <h2>Errors</h2>
                <p>These errors are in alphabetical order and contain the start of the
                    complete message.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>ClassNotFoundException</dt>
                    <dd>The XML file is attempting load an object for which the code
                        required to create that object (its <em>class</em>) does not
                        exist. There are three possible reasons for this, in order of
                        likelihood:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The class was removed from JMRI. We sometimes remove
                                classes that were replaced by other classes, generally
                                years after the replacement was implemented. The following
                                table is a partial list of these classes with the
                                replacement class and recommended remediation:
                                <table>
                                    <tr>
                                        <th>Removed Class</th>
                                        <th>Replacement Class</th>
                                        <th>Remediation</th>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>jmri.configurexml.AbstractSignalHeadManagerXml</td>
                                        <td>jmri.managers.configurexml.AbstractSignalHeadManagerXml</td>
                                        <td>Replace instances of removed class with replacement class in file.</td>
                                    </tr>
                                </table>
                            </li>
                            <li>The file was generated in a newer version of JMRI than
                                the one being used. The recommended remediation for this
                                is to continue to use the newer version. If that is not
                                possible, seek assistance on the JMRI User's Group.
                            </li>
                            <li>The class was in a plugin developed by a third party. The
                                plugin will need to be reinstalled, or the contents
                                causing issues will need to be removed. Seek assistance
                                from the developer of that plugin or on the JMRI User's
                                Group.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Parse error</dt>
                    <dd>The XML file is not readable for some reason. This can be for one
                        of two reasons:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The file is not valid XML. This could be the result of
                                editing the file to fix another error, or it's being
                                truncated by another process. Seek assistance on the
                                JMRI User's Group.</li>
                            <li>The file does not conform to the XML schema JMRI
                                requires file to conform to. Specific schema validations
                                and the recommended remediation are:
                                <table>
                                    <tr>
                                        <th>Error</th>
                                        <th>Remediation</th>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Attribute "error" must be declared for element type "sensoricon"</td>
                                        <td><ol>
                                                <li>Remove the text <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE layout-config SYSTEM "layout-config.dtd"&gt;</code></li>
                                                <li>Replace <code>&lt;layout-config&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;layout-config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://jmri.org/xml/schema/layout.xsd"&gt;</code>.
