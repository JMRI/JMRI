      <h1>JMRI: System Console</h1>
      <p>The JMRI System Console panel is where you
        get system output from JMRI.</p>
      <!-- Copied from NCE help -->

      <h2>Using the System Console</h2>

      <p>JMRI provides connection information via the system console.
        You can find the system console under the main menu header "Help"
        then "System console...". Below is an image of the console window
        when the program is operating normally. Note that the window size
        has been adjusted so we can read it a bit more easily.</p>

      <p><img src="../../html/hardware/images/jmriConsoleOk.jpg" alt="JMRI Console"></p>

      <p>If you're having problems, the console window can look like
        the one below:</p>

      <p><img src="../../html/hardware/images/jmriConsoleFail.jpg" alt=
              "JMRI Console"></p>

      <p>To help you better understand what might be happening and to
        possibly resolve your problem we'll explain some of the warning
        and error messages displayed in the above console window.</p>

      <p>The very first messages are information message labeled
        "INFO". The first message occurs at time "0" which can be found
        at the left side of the message. The next "INFO" message states
        where this log file is stored. The next info provides the version
        of JMRI and JAVA that you are using. And the last info message
        provides the communication port that you've selected in
        preferences, along with the baud rate or the speed of your
        connection.</p>

      <p>The first warning message states that there was a timeout to
        message "AA". During startup, JMRI checks to see if your
        Preferences match those in the NCE command station. Message "AA"
        requests the EPROM revision of the command station. The response
        is normally three characters, something like "6.2.1". A timeout
        means that JMRI asked for something and the command station
        didn't respond. When the connection is correct and the system is
        powered up, you should not see any timeout messages.</p>

      <p>The next warning message states that because there was a
        timeout, the program didn't get the information requested from
        the command station. The next messages continue as the program
        tries every 10 seconds to read the EPROM revision by issuing the
        "AA" command. You can try and trouble shoot your connections
        knowing that every 10 seconds JMRI will retest to see if you've
        fixed the problem.</p>

      <p>Whenever JMRI detects a problem with the connection or NCE
        command station, it will request the EPROM revision to see if the
        connection and command station is still operational. So if you
        see timeouts and "AA" commands you have either poor or failed
        connection, or a powered down or failed command station.</p>
