      <h1>Introduction to DecoderPro</h1>

      <p><strong>THIS HELP FILE IS WORK IN PROGRESS</strong>. Please help JMRI by contributing to
      improve this help file !</p>

      <p>DecoderPro presents a list of your locomotives (the Roster) and provides access to tools
      for programming decoder configuration variables (CV's). Some stationary decoders can also be
      added to this database.</p>

      <h2>Description of DecoderPro Window</h2>

      <p>The DecoderPro Window is divided into five main sections from top to bottom.</p>

      <h2>Main Tasks with DecoderPro</h2>

      <p>DecoderPro is designed for the management of DCC decoders fitted to locomotives. The
      locomotives known to DecoderPro are displayed in the Roster Table. The anticipated main
      tasks are: creating a new locomotive and changing the settings in an existing locomotive
      (programming).</p>

      <h3>New Locomotive</h3>

      <p>To add a new locomotive (or first locomotive, or stationary decoder), click on the
      "New Entry" button on the Tool Bar.<br>
      This will open a "Create New Loco" window, where the decoder can be either identified or
      selected from the list. To create the locomotive, having selected (or identified) a decoder,
      select the Programmer format (Basic or Comprehensive) and click "Open Programmer". A
      Programming window for the new locomotive will open, with the "Roster Entry" tab foremost. It
      is recommended to give the locomotive a name in the "ID:" field, and then click "Save to
      Roster". You can also proceed to program the decoder, giving it a DCC address (in the "Basic"
      tab), and set other values. On closing the Programming window, if prompted, save the results
      into the Roster.</p>

      <h3>Identifying An Existing Locomotive Entry</h3>

      <p>If a locomotive is placed on the Programming Track, the "Find in Roster" button will read
      details from the decoder and try to match it to an entry in the Roster Table. Some decoders
      only work with a limited range of programming modes, and it may be necessary to change the
      programming mode with the "Programming Mode" drop down list.<br>
      If a locomotive is correctly identified, it will be highlighted in the Roster Table, and its
      details will appear in the lower Decoder Information Area.</p>

      <h3>Using the Roster Table</h3>
      
      The Roster Table shows one row for each locomotive in your roster.
      There are several things you can do with the table entries:
      <h4>Change some fields of the entry</h4>
        You can directly edit the contents of some of the fields, 
        such as the Owner, Road Number, Manufacturer, Model and Comment.
        Click in a field to show an edit cursor, then type your changes.
        Hit the Return or Enter key to save your changes.
        <p>
        The comment field and the user-added fields can accept multi-line
        text.  To create a new line, type ctrl-Return or alt-Return.
        As usual, you hit Return or Enter with no modifiers when you're done editing.
        <p>
        <b>Note:</b> As of February 2026, the cell height doesn't expand to show
        the new lines you've typed with ctrl-Return or alt-Return until
        you've saved your changes by hitting Enter or Return.
        Unfortunately, you have to type your changes in blind and 
        then hit Enter/Return to see them, and correct them as needed.
        We're working on a fix for this.
      
      <h4>Sort by Values and Rearrange Columns</h4>
        To sort by the contents of a column, click the heading at the top of the 
        column.  Click again to sort in the opposite order.
        <p>
        You can change the size of a column by pressing-and-dragging the line
        between the column headings.  You can move columns around by pressing-and-dragging
        in the center center of the heading.
        <p>
        To hide or show columns, right-press or ctrl-press on a column heading.
        This will show you a contextual menu where you can check the boxes by the columns
        you want to see, and uncheck the columns you don't want to see.
        
      <h4>Add New Columns for  User Data</h4>
        You can add additional columns if there's some other 
        information you'd like to keep  track of.  For example, 
        you might want to keep track of the driver layout (0-4-0, 2-6-2, etc)
        for a steam locomotive.  To create a new column:
        <ul>
            <li>Select the first locomotive you'd like to 
                add a value to.
            <li>Click "Labels & Media", then open the "Roster Media" tab
            <li>In the bottom part of that tab,  there's a 
                two column table.  The last of the entries in the right
                column will be "...".  
            <li>Click on that cell and type the name of your new column. 
                Hit the Return or Enter key.
            <li>Click on the cell to the right of that and enter a value
                for this locomotive in this new column you're adding.
                Hit the Return or Enter key.
            <li>Click "Save" at the bottom.
            <li>Quit and restart DecoderPro
            <li>Your new column should show in the Roster Table.  You may
                have to drag the content to the right to see it, or
                ctrl-click/right-click on one of the column headers to 
                set it to visible.
        </ul>
        Once you've created the new column, you can edit the contents
        directly in the Roster Table, or by going back to the 
        "Roster Media" tab.

      <h3>Programming an existing Locomotive</h3>

      <p>Once a locomotive has been selected, either by manually finding it within the Roster
      Table, or through the "Identify" button, a summary of its details will appear in the lower
      Decoder Information Area. Buttons to open the programmer are to the right of the Decoder
      Information Area.</p>

      <p>Select the type of programming required with the radio buttons, choose between the
      Programming Track, Programming on the Main Line or Edit the file only (no programming of a
      locomotive). Having selected the type of programming, you can open either the Basic
      Programmer (which allows change of locomotive address) or the Comprehensive Programmer (which
      allows changing of all locomotive decoder features known to DecoderPro).</p>

      <h3>Changing Throttle Labels and Roster Media</h3>

      <p>Throttle Labels are used by the JMRI on-screen Throttles and by the smart-phone throttles
      through the WiThrottle interface. They allow Function keys to have meaningful names such as
      "Horn", "Whistle", rather than "F2" and "F4". Their use is optional.</p>

      <p>Roster Media is where pictures of locomotives can be loaded into JMRI. These are displayed
      in the Roster, and can be used within Throttles. Their use is optional.</p>

      <h3>Roster Groups</h3>

      <p>Roster Groups are a means of filtering your entries in the Roster. For example, you might
      have "diesel locos", "steam locos", but also "Burlington Locos" and "Canadian Pacific Locos".
      Thus a single locomotive in the Roster could be a member of several groups. Roster Groups are
      used to filter the Roster View in DecoderPro, and select the locomotives offered in an
      on-screen Throttle.</p>

      <p>To create your first Roster Group, use the "Create Roster Group" command on the "Settings"
      menu. When you have created a Roster Group, a new drop-list is added to the Tool Bar in
      DecoderPro. Having created a group, it is initially empty. The next step is to add
      locomotives to the group.  You can drag and drop a selected (highlighted line)
      locomotive from the table and drop it on the group you want to include it in.
      
      <p>If you want to add a number of locomotives to a group.
      the "Roster Group Table Association" command on
      the "Settings" menu is a convenient tool. 
      With the "Roster Group Table" window, select the Roster Group in the
      drop-menu, and then place a tick alongside all locomotives requires in that group. Repeat for
      any other groups, and when finished close the window with the close-box in the upper
      right-hand corner.</p>
      
      <p>You can also add locomotives to groups one at a time using the 
      "Add Roster Entry to Group..." entry in the "Settings" menu. 
      Or you can right-press or ctrl-press on a selected line in the 
      table to get a pop-up menu that contains an "Add to Group..." item.
