      <h1>Introduction to DecoderPro 3</h1>

      <p><b>THIS HELP FILE IS WORK IN PROGRESS</b>. Please help
      JMRI by contributing to improve this help file !</p>

      <p>DecoderPro 3 presents a list of your locomotives (the
      Roster) and provides access to tools for programming decoder
      configuration variables (CV's).</p>

      <h2>Description of DecoderPro 3 Window</h2>

      <p>The DecoderPro 3 Window is divided into five main
      sections from top to bottom.</p>

      <h2>Main Tasks with DecoderPro 3</h2>

      <p>DecoderPro 3 is designed for the management of DCC
      decoders fitted to locomotives. The locomotives known to
      DecoderPro 3 are displayed in the Roster Table. The
      anticipated main tasks are: creating a new locomotive and
      changing the settings in an existing locomotive
      (programming).</p>

      <h3>New Locomotive</h3>

      <p>To add a new locomotive (or first locomotive), click on
      the "New Loco" button on the Tool Bar. This will open a
      "Create New Loco" window, where the decoder can be either
      identified or selected from the list. To create the
      locomotive, having selected (or identified) a decoder, select
      the Programmer format (Basic or Comprehensive) and click
      "Open Programmer". A Programming window for the new
      locomotive will open, with the "Roster Entry" tab foremost.
      It is recommended to give the locomotive a name in the "ID:"
      field, and then click "Save to Roster". You can also proceed
      to program the decoder, giving it a DCC address (in the
      "Basic" tab), and set other values. On closing the
      Programming window, if prompted, save the results into the
      Roster.</p>

      <h3>Identify Existing Locomotive</h3>

      <p>If a locomotive is placed on the Programming Track, the
      "Identify" button will read details from the decoder and try
      to match it to an entry in the Roster Table. Some decoders
      only work with a limited range of programming modes, and it
      may be necessary to change the programming mode with the
      "Programming Mode" drop down list.<br>
      If a locomotive is correctly identified, it
      will be highlighted in the Roster Table, and its details will
      appear in the lower Decoder Information Area.</p>

      <h3>Programming an existing Locomotive</h3>

      <p>Once a locomotive has been selected, either by manually
      finding it within the Roster Table, or through the "Identify"
      button, a summary of its details will appear in the lower
      Decoder Information Area. Buttons to open the programmer are
      to the right of the Decoder Information Area.</p>

      <p>Select the type of programming required with the radio
      buttons, choose between the Programming Track, Programming on
      the Main Line or Edit the file only (no programming of a
      locomotive). Having selected the type of programming, you can
      open either the Basic Programmer (which allows change of
      locomotive address) or the Comprehensive Programmer (which
      allows changing of all locomotive decoder features known to
      DecoderPro).</p>

      <h3>Changing Throttle Labels and Roster Media</h3>

      <p>Throttle Labels are used by the JMRI on-screen Throttles
      and by the smart-phone throttles through the WiThrottle
      interface. They allow Function keys to have meaningful names
      such as "Horn", "Whistle", rather than "F2" and "F4". Their
      use is optional.</p>

      <p>Roster Media is where pictures of locomotives can be
      loaded into JMRI. These are displayed in the Roster, and can
      be used within Throttles. Their use is optional.</p>

      <h3>Roster Groups</h3>

      <p>Roster Groups are a means of filtering your entries in the
      Roster. For example, you might have "diesel locos", "steam
      locos", but also "Burlington Locos" and "Canadian Pacific
      Locos". Thus a single locomotive in the Roster could be a
      member of several groups. Roster Groups are used to filter
      the Roster View in DecoderPro 3, and select the locomotives
      offered in an on-screen Throttle.</p>

      <p>To create your first Roster Group, use the "Create Roster
      Group" command on the "Settings" menu. When you have created
      a Roster Group, a new drop-list is added to the Tool Bar in
      DecoderPro 3. Having created a group, it is initially empty.
      The next step is to add locomotives to the group. This is
      done with the "Roster Group Table Association" command on the
      "Settings" menu. With the "Roster Group Table" window, select
      the Roster Group in the drop-menu, and then place a tick
      alongside all locomotives requires in that group. Repeat for
      any other groups, and when finished close the window with the
      close-box in the upper right-hand corner.</p><a name=
