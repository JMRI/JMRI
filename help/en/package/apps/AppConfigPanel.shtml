<H2>JMRI: Preferences Window</H2>

The preferences window is where you 
configure the basic operation of your JMRI application.
There's a top part that contains the basics, and 
a separate section for advanced preferences.

<p>
This page is under construction. 
In the meantime, there's some more information on preferences
on some 
<a href="../../DecoderProManual/Getting_Started.shtml#Preferences">tutorial pages</a>.

<a id="basic">
<h3>Basic Preferences</h3></a>

When the window first opens, it displays the 
basic preferences.<br/>

<dl>
<dt>Layout Connection
<dd>You can select any of the various JMRI layout connections here.
For more information on how to configure this for your particular hardware,
see the <a href="../../html/hardware/index.shtml">hardware pages</a>.
<dt>GUI Style
<dd>These radio boxes allow you to select how the program looks.
The available choices depend on what kind of computer you have, and not 
all of the following may be available:
    <ul>
    <li>Metal - the default Java style, usable on all computers
    <li>CDE/Motif - A Linux/Unix form that works well with X Windows
        screen managers.  It's also available on (almost) all computer types.
    <li>Windows - only available on Microsoft Windows systems, this makes the
        program look as much as possible like a regular Windows application.
    <li>Mac OS X - only available on MacOS, this makes the program look
        like a Macintosh application
    </ul>
<dt>Programmer Defaults
<dd>The DecoderPro programmer allows you to select how much or how little
to display of the decoder content using configurable "Programmers". You 
can select one at the same time you 
<a href="../../DecoderProManual/Basic_Programming.shtml">select your locomotive decoder</a>,
but this provides a convenient place to set a default so you don't
have to select it each time you open a decoder.
</dl>

<a id="advanced">
<h3>Advanced Preferences</h3></a>

To set the advanced preferences, check the "Show Advanced Preferences" box.<br/>
<a href="../../DecoderProManual/Pix/Preferences2.png"/>
<img src="../../DecoderProManual/Pix/Preferences2.png" height="222" width="256"/></a>

<dl>
<dt>Auxiliary layout connections
<dd>You can have more than one layout connection active at a time.  These choices allow
you to easily configure up to four, and more are possible.

<dt>Programmer Defaults
<dd>This section has a checkbox that lets you decide whether the DecoderPro
programmer will display empty panes (tabs). Some people like to see them, even though they're empty,
some people would prefer not to see them, so they don't keep trying to look at them.  We
provide this preference so you can choose.

<dt>Locale
<dd><a href="../../Acknowledgements.shtml">Many people</a> have contributed "internationalizations"
of JMRI.  This converts (much) of the text on the screen to a language
other thank English.  If you select your country or region and language here,
then save and restart the preferences, JMRI will use an internationalization
for that country and language if it's available.  Items that have not been translated 
will continue to appear in English, so you won't miss anything.  For
more information on how to set this up, and particularly how to contribute
new and improved translations, please see our
<a href="../../html/doc/Technical/I8N.shtml">internationalization page</a>.
