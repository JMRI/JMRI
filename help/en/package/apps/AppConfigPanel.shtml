      <h1>JMRI: Older Preferences Pane</h1>

      <p class="important">This page describes an older Preferences
      pane that was replaced by <a href="TabbedPreferences.shtml">a
      new layout</a> in <a href=
      "http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri2.9.4.shtml">JMRI
      2.9.4</a>. Information on the new version is on <a href=
      "TabbedPreferences.shtml">this page</a>.</p>

      <p>The Preferences pane is where you configure the basic
      operation of your JMRI application.</p><a name="basic" id=
      "basic"></a>

      <h2>Basic Preferences</h2>

      <p>When the panel first opens, it displays the basic
      Preferences.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "../../manual/DecoderPro/images/Preferences.png"><img src=

      width="252" align="right"></a></p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Layout Connection</dt>

        <dd>You can select any of the various JMRI layout
        Connections here. For more information on how to configure
        this for your particular hardware, see the <a href=
        "../../html/hardware/index.shtml">Hardware help
        pages</a>.</dd>

        <dt>GUI Style</dt>

        <dd>
          These radio boxes allow you to select how the program
          looks. The available choices depend on what kind of
          computer you have, and not all of the following may be
          available:

          <ul>
            <li>Metal - the default Java style, usable on all
            computers</li>

            <li>CDE/Motif - A Linux/Unix form that works well with
            X Windows screen managers. It's also available on
            (almost) all computer types.</li>

            <li>Windows - only available on Microsoft Windows
            systems, this makes the program look as much as
            possible like a regular Windows application.</li>

            <li>Mac OS X - only available on MacOS, this makes the
            program look like a Macintosh application</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Programmer Defaults</dt>

        <dd>The DecoderPro programmer allows you to select how much
        or how little to display of the decoder content using
        configurable "Programmers". You can select one at the same
        time you <a href=
        "../../manual/DecoderPro/Basic_Start.shtml">select your
        locomotive decoder</a>, but this provides a convenient
        place to set a default so you don't have to select it each
        time you open a decoder.</dd>
      </dl>Perhaps the most important control is at the bottom of
      this section: The "Save" button!

      <p>Be sure to click "Save" when leaving this window. Your
      changes to the preferences don't take effect until the
      program is stopped and restarted, so the program will prompt
      you to do that after saving the preferences. <a name=
      "advanced" id="advanced"></a></p>

      <h2>Advanced Preferences</h2>Advanced Preferences allows you
      to customize your connection to the layout. You do not need
      to use them to get your initial connection to the layout up
      and running, and it is recommended that you leave them alone
      until the connection to your command station is operational.
      To set the advanced preferences, check the "Show Advanced
      Preferences" box.<br>

      <p><a href=
      "../../manual/DecoderPro/images/Preferences2.png"><img src=
      "../../manual/DecoderPro/images/Preferences2.png" height=
      "144" width="252" align="right"></a></p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Auxiliary layout connections</dt>

        <dd>The auxiliary connections allow you to have more than
        one layout connection active at a time. Most users only
        need one connection, therefore select an auxiliary
        connection only if you need more than one connection to the
        layout. Use the "Layout Connection:" at the top of the
        Preferences Menu for your primary connection.</dd>

        <dt>Programmer Defaults</dt>

        <dd>This section has a checkbox that lets you decide
        whether the DecoderPro programmer will display empty panes
        (tabs). Some people like to see them, even though they're
        empty, some people would prefer not to see them, so they
        don't keep trying to look at them. We provide this
        preference so you can choose. <a name="locale" id=
        "locale"></a></dd>

        <dt>Locale</dt>

        <dd><a href="../../Acknowledgements.shtml">Many people</a>
        have contributed "internationalizations" of JMRI. This
        converts (much) of the text on the screen to a language
        other thank English. If you select your country or region
        and language here, then save and restart the preferences,
        JMRI will use an internationalization for that country and
        language if it's available. Items that have not been
        translated will continue to appear in English, so you won't
        miss anything. For more information on how to set this up,
        and particularly how to contribute new and improved
        translations, please see our <a href=
        "../../html/doc/Technical/I8N.shtml">internationalization
        page</a>. <a name="actions" id="actions"></a></dd>

        <dt>Do actions at startup</dt>

        <dd>
          This section lets you have the program automatically
          execute various menu selections at startup. For example,
          you can have the Turnout Table automatically open, or
          automatically open a window for programming on the main.

          <p>For example, to automatically open the Turnout Table,
          click the "Add Action" button in this section of the
          advanced preferences. From the list that's presented,
          select "Open Turnout Table". Don't forget to save your
          updated preferences with the button at the bottom of the
          screen!</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Create buttons on the main screen</dt>

        <dd>
          This allows you to add extra buttons to the main JMRI
          window that are connected to specific menu choices.

          <p>For example, to add a button that will open the Power
          Control when clicked, click the "Add Action" button in
          this section of the advanced preferences. From the list
          that's presented, select "Open Turnout Table". Don't
          forget to save your updated preferences with the button
          at the bottom of the screen! From the list that's
          presented, select "Open Power Control". Don't forget to
          save your updated preferences with the button at the
          bottom of the screen! The button will appear when you
          next start the program.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Load panel files at startup</dt>

        <dd>
          This section lets you automatically load panel files when
          the program starts up. The previous sections will have
          already executed, so any actions they're configured for
          will have taken place. You can load as many panel files
          as you'd like; each will be completely loaded before the
          next is started.

          <p>Click "Add File", which will open a file section
          window in which you can select the desired file. If you
          later want to stop loading the file at startup, click the
          "Remove" button next to the filename.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Run scripts at startup</dt>

        <dd>
          This section lets you automatically run a script file
          when the program starts up. The previous sections will
          have already executed, so any actions they're configured
          for will have taken place and all panel files will have
          been loaded. You can run as many script files as you'd
          like; each will be run to the end of the file before the
          next is started.

          <p>Click "Add File", which will open a file section
          window in which you can select the desired file. If you
          later want to stop executing a particular script at
          startup, click the "Remove" button next to the filename.
          <a id="roster" name="roster"></a></p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Set the location of the Roster</dt>

        <dd>
          Normally, the Roster is stored in a standard location as
          part of the <a href=
          "../../html/apps/DecoderPro/Files.shtml">Preferences
          directory</a>. This option lets you move that somewhere
          else.

          <p>To configure it, click the "Set..." button and follow
          the directions.</p>

          <p>The "Reset" button restores it to the default
          location. Note that this just changes where the program
          looks. If you've stored roster information elsewhere and
          want it back in the default location, you have to move
          the files there yourself.</p>

          <p>You can also enter a default value for the "Owner"
          field in DecoderPro roster entries here. This fills in
          the value for new entries, which can save you a little
          bit of typing. It has no effect on existing entries, even
          if changed.</p>
