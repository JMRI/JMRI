      <h1>JMRI: Issue Reporter</h1>
      <p>The JMRI Issue Reporter allows you
        to create an entry in JMRI's 
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues">Issue tracking system</a>
        for either a bug report or a feature request.</p>
        
    <p>In order to create an entry, you need a (free)
        GitHub account. If you don't have one yet, follow
        <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up">this link</a>
        and sign up for one.</p>

        paste the URL you got into a new window of your browser and fetch the indicated page.
