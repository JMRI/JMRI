<h1>JMRI: Preferences Pane</h1>

The Preferences pane is where you 
configure the basic operation of your JMRI application.
<p>
The screen is split into two sections: on the left hand side is a list of the Preference groups that can be set. 
Clicking on each item will then populate the right hand side with the various options that can be configured for that Tab.

<p>Perhaps the most important control is at the bottom of this section:
The <strong>Save</strong> button!  
<p><img src="images/PrefsRestart.png" height="112" width="390" align="right">
Be sure to click "Save" when leaving this window. Your changes to the Preferences
don't take effect until the program is stopped and restarted, so the
program will prompt you to do that after saving the Preferences.
</p>

<a name="Connection">
<h2>Connections</h2></a>

You can select any of the various JMRI layout Connections here.<p>
<a href="images/Ops_SetConnection214.png">
<img src="images/Ops_SetConnection214.png" height="222" width="423" align="right" alt="JMRI v2.14 Connection Prefs tab"></a>
Each connection has its own unique tab. To get started, first select your DCC System Manufacturer,
followed by the type of Connection that you are using.  You will then be presented with a series of 
most commonly required settings that need to be set.  If you need to change some of the more advanced 
settings then connection then check the "Additional Connection Settings" box and this will provide you with 
further details.
<p>
To add an additional layout Connection, in the Connections pane click on the tab with a "+", this will then present you with a fresh 
connection tab.  To remove a Connection, in the System Manufacturer drop down list, select <strong>(none selected)</strong> to just clear your present choices and enter new ones, or click on the small "x" in the Tab name to delete the Connection.
<p>
For more information on how to configure this for your particular hardware,
see the <a href="../../html/hardware/index.shtml">Hardware Help pages</a>.
<p>
Remember to press <strong>Save</strong>!

<a href="images/JMRI_PrefsDefaults.png">
<img src="images/JMRI_PrefsDefaults.png" height="222" width="419" align="right" alt="JMRI v2.14 Defaults Prefs tab"></a>
<a name="Defaults">
<h2>Defaults</h2></a>
If you are using multiple connections, e.g. a
LocoNet Connection and a MERG Connection, the Defaults pane lets you select which one is connected
to e.g. the CV programmer and the Command Station you want to use. A second Connection of the same type will have the number (2) added in its name and its System-specific menu.

<a name="FileLocations">
<h2>File Locations</h2></a>
These allow you to set the default location for where scripts and user files are loaded and saved to.
<p>
Note that when changing the "User Files Location" this will also change the default location for where the following are stored:
<dl>
<dd>Panels<br>
Rosters<br>
Operations<br>
Throttle<br>
Resources<br>
Dispatcher options<br>
Rps
</dl>

<p>There's a 
<a href="../../html/setup/Dropbox.shtml">separate Help page</a>
with information on sharing files between computers using Dropbox.

<a name="Startup">
<h2>Start Up</h2></a>
<p><em>Start Up</em> preferences allow windows and files to be opened, scripts
    to be run, and additional buttons to be placed on the main window when the
    application starts.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Add &#x25BE;</strong> button and select the type of start up
    action to add. The new action will be added last.</p>
<p>Start up action order is important. In most cases, scripts should be the last
    items in the start up order. Start up order can be changed by selecting a
    start up item and moving it <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> in the list.</p>
<p>There are five types of start up actions:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Perform action</dt>
    <dd>
Have the program automatically
execute various menu selections at startup.  For example,
you can have the Turnout Table automatically open, or 
automatically open a window for programming on the main.
    </dd>
    <dt>Add button to main window</dt>
    <dd>
Add extra buttons to the main JMRI window
that are connected to specific actions in menus for easy and quick access to that action.
    </dd>
    <dt>Open file</dt>
    <dd>
Automatically load panel files when the program
starts up.  You can load
as many panel files as you'd like; each will be completely loaded before the next
is started.
    </dd>
    <dt>Run script</dt>
    <dd>
        Automatically run a scripts when the program starts up. You can run as
        many scripts as you'd like; each will be run to completion before the
        next is started. Note that any files the script depends upon need to be
        opened before running the script.
    </dd>
    <dt>Set route</dt>
    <dd>
        Set a route when the program starts. You can set as many routes as you
        like; each will be set in order. Note that any files the route depends
        upon need to be opened before setting the route.
    </dd>
</dl>

<a name="Display">
<h2>Display</h2></a>

<dl>
<dt>GUI
<dd>These radio boxes allow you to select how the program looks.
The available choices depend on what kind of computer you have, and not 
all of the following may be available:
    <ul>
    <li>Metal - the default Java style, usable on all computers
    <li>CDE/Motif - A Linux/Unix form that works well with X Windows
        screen managers.  It's also available on (almost) all computer types.
    <li>Windows - only available on Microsoft Windows systems, this makes the
        program look as much as possible like a regular Windows application.
    <li>Mac OS X - only available on MacOS, this makes the program look
        like a Macintosh application
    </ul>
<dt>Locale
<dd><a href="../../Acknowledgements.shtml">Many people</a> have contributed "internationalizations"
of JMRI.  This converts (much) of the text on the screen to a language
other thank English.  If you select your country or region and language here,
then save and restart the preferences, JMRI will use an internationalization
for that country and language if it's available.  Items that have not been translated 
will continue to appear in English, so you won't miss anything.  For
more information on how to set this up, and particularly how to contribute
new and improved translations, please see our
<a href="../../html/doc/Technical/I8N.shtml">internationalization page</a>.
<dt>Console
<dd>This allows you to customize the way that the JMRI System Console looks.
It is possible to select from a number of pre-defined color schemes and to
choose the font size and style.
Also, you can choose to save both the size and location of the System Console
window so that it always appears in the same place and at the same size.

<img src="images/PrefsMsgPane421.png" height="214" width="375" align="right" alt="JMRI v4.2 Roster Prefs tab"></a>
<a name="Messages">
<h2>Messages</h2></a>
This allows you to change the way that information and warning messages are displayed in JMRI.<br>
It will also allow you to configure a default responses and the question being displayed.

<a name="Roster">
<h2>Roster</h2></a>
<a href="images/PrefsRoster42.png">

<dl>
<dt>Programmer
<dd>The DecoderPro programmer allows you to select how much or how little
to display of the decoder content using configurable "Programmers". You 
can select one at the same time you 
<a href="../../manual/Basic_Programming.shtml">select your locomotive decoder</a>,
but this provides a convenient place to set a default so you don't
have to select it each time you open a decoder.

<p>
This section also has a checkbox that lets you decide whether the DecoderPro
programmer will display empty panes (tabs). 
Some people like to see them, even though they're empty;
some people would prefer not to see them, 
so they don't keep trying to look at them.  
We provide this preference so you can choose.

<dt>Roster
<dd>
Normally, the Roster is stored in a standard location
as part of the
<a href="../../html/apps/DecoderPro/Files.shtml">Preferences directory</a>.
This option lets you move that somewhere else.
<p>
To configure it, click the "Set..." button and follow the directions.
<p>
The "Reset" button restores it to the default location. Note that
this just changes where the program looks.  If you've stored roster
information elsewhere and want it back in the default location, you have
to move the files there yourself.
<p>
You can also enter a default value for the "Owner" field in DecoderPro
roster entries here.  This fills in the value for new entries, which 
can save you a little bit of typing. It has no effect on 
existing entries, even if changed.

</dl>

<a name="Throttle">
<h2>Throttle</h2></a>

This Preference pane tab lets you select whether the extended Throttle
features are available, and which ones can be used.

<a name="WiThrottle">
<h2>WiThrottle</h2></a>

<dl>
<dt>eStop

<dd>If selected,
listens for a packet to be sent from the connected mobile device.
If the server does not receive any communication in the
chosen time, the affected JMRI throttle will idle its train.

<p>
The chosen time is approximate; the response may be a few seconds
earlier or later.

<dt>Network

<dd>Change the port number to use. Ensure your firewall software allows this port to be used.

<dt>Allowed Controls

<dd>Check boxes to allow specific features to be controlled by mobile devices.
This will let you to limit what users have the ability to control.
<ul>
    <li>Track Power - Select whether mobile devices connected through
        this WiFi interface can control track power.
    <li>Turnouts - Select whether mobile devices can control turnouts.
    <li>Routes - Select whether mobile devices can control routes.
    <li>Consists - If selected, mobile devices can build &amp; break "Advanced Consists".
        <ul>
            <li>NMRA Format - These consists may perform better for building and controlling with WiFi devices.
            <li>DCC Brand-Specific - These consists should perform better when built with a WiFi device, 
                but controlled by a throttle from the DCC manufacturer of your system.
        </ul>
</ul>
</dl>

The "Apply" button puts the current settings into effect, without
saving them permanently.  For a connected <a href="../jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml">WiThrottle</a> to use the
new settings, its connection must be closed and reopened.

<a name="Profiles">
<h2>Config Profiles</h2></a>

JMRI Configuration Profiles make it easy to set up your 
JMRI applications to work with different setups.  Each profile
specifies one set of Preferences.  You can then select which one to use.
<p>
For more information, see the 
<a href="../../html/setup/profiles.shtml">Configuration Profiles</a> help
page.

<a name="RailroadName">
<h2>Railroad Name</h2></a>
<p>
The Railroad Name tab lets you specify the name of your model railroad (module), as it is used by several server protocols.</p>

<a name="JSONServer">
<h2>JSON Server</h2></a>
<p>
The JMRI <a href="../../html/web/JsonServlet.shtml">JSON server</a> is used by applications on other computers,
including tablets and phones, to connect to JMRI to operate your 
railroad.</p>
<p>
On this pane you can specify the port for the connection (usually left at default)
and how often the server checks for whether the connection has failed via a heartbeat
message.</p>

<a name="WebServer">
<h2>Web Server</h2></a>

The JMRI Web Server lets you 
connect to JMRI from a web browser on your computer, tablet or phone
and work with your railroad.  
<p>
This tab lets you control what the web server provides.
For more information, see the 
<a href="../../html/web/index.shtml#Configure">Web Server Preferences pane</a> page.

<a name="SRCP Server">
<h2>SRCP Server</h2></a>
<p>
The JMRI <a href="../../html/hardware/SRCP/index.shtml">SRCP server</a> is a standard way of connecting "client" user programs to a "server".</p>
<p>
On this pane you can specify the port for the connection (usually left at default).
</p>

<a name="Simple Server">
<h2>Simple Server</h2></a>
<p>
JMRI Simple Server is part of <a href="../../html/hardware/jmriclient/index.shtml">JMRIClient</a>, a method to remotely connecting one JMRI program to another.</p>
<p>
On this pane you can specify the port for the connection (usually left at default).
</p>

<a name="Warrants">
<h2>Warrants</h2></a>

This tab sets parameters used in computing routes for <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/logix/Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a> and for
controlling the events that warranted trains may encounter.

<h3>Speed Map</h3>
<p>
When an automatically running train encounters a Signal that calls for a speed change,
or progress is blocked by occupancy ahead, the speed map table is used to make the 
necessary speed change.  Other parameters control the way the speed change is ramped. 
<p>
The Speed Map maps the speed names found in the aspects definition of a signal system to a value.
It is important that all the speed names used in your signal system be listed in the Speed Map Table.
The value associated with a speed name can be interpreted in four different ways: As a percentage of 
the current throttle setting as recorded or set by an NXWarrant ("PercentNormal"), or as a percentage
of the full throttle setting ("PercentFullThrottle").  The last two ways interpret the value as
a scale track speed; Miles per Hour or Kilometers per Hour.  Use the radio buttons to select how
the code should interpret the Speed Map. 
<p>
The Head Appearance Map is used when Signal Heads are used as signals.  It maps the appearance to a speed
name which in turn is mapped by the Speed Map table.
<p>
It is important that the correct scale is chosen and that the value of "Throttle Setting/Speed Factor" is reasonable for
engine addresses that run on warrants.  The factor adjusts the throttle setting to be scale track speed.  
The Throttle Factor set here is the global default, but factors for
individual engine address can be determined with NXWarrants.
<p>
The "Max Number of Blocks in Route" is the depth to which JMRI will search for a route when defining
a warrant.  This is a global value that can be overridden when creating a warrant.
<p>
The remaining items on the panel are used when JMRI makes a speed change due to a signal aspect or
occupancy ahead. The speed change is made with a series of incremental throttle settings.  "Ramp
Step Time" is the duration of each step and "Ramp Step Throttle Increment" is the amount of 
throttle setting change.
<p> 
For more information on Warrant preferences, see  
<a href="../jmri/jmrit/logix/Warrant.shtml#SpeedMap">About Warrants</a> and follow its links.
