      <h1>JMRI: Preferences Pane</h1>
      The Preferences pane is where
      you configure the basic operation of your JMRI application.

      <p>The screen is split into two sections: on the left hand
      side is a list of the Preference groups that can be set.
      Clicking on each item will then populate the right hand side
      with the various options that can be configured for that Tab.

      <p>Perhaps the most important control is at the bottom of
      this section: The <strong>Save</strong> button!</p>

      <p><img src="images/PrefsRestart.png" height="112" width=
      "390" align="right"> Be sure to click "Save" when leaving
      this window. Your changes to the Preferences don't take
      effect until the program is stopped and restarted, so the
      program will prompt you to do that after saving the
      Preferences.</p><a name="Connection" id="Connection"></a>

      <h2>Connections</h2>You can select any of the various JMRI
      layout Connections here.

      <p><a href="../../html/setup/images/PrefsConnections_en.png"><img src=
      "../../html/setup/images/PrefsConnections_en.png" height="195" width="425"
      align="right" alt="JMRI v4 Connection Prefs tab"></a>
      Each
      connection has its own unique tab. To get started, first
      select your DCC System Manufacturer, followed by the type of
      Connection that you are using. You will then be presented
      with a series of most commonly required settings that need to
      be set. If you need to change some of the more advanced
      settings then connection then check the "Additional
      Connection Settings" box and this will provide you with
      further details.</p>

      <p>To add an additional layout Connection, in the Connections
      pane click on the tab with a "+", this will then present you
      with a fresh connection tab. To remove a Connection, in the
      System Manufacturer drop down list, select <strong>(none
      selected)</strong> to just clear your present choices and
      enter new ones, or click on the small "x" in the Tab name to
      delete the Connection.</p>

      <p>For more information on how to configure this for your
      particular hardware, see the <a href=
      "../../html/hardware/index.shtml">Hardware Help
      pages</a>.</p>

      <p>Remember to press <strong>Save</strong>!</p>

      </a>
      <p>If you are using multiple connections, e.g. a LocoNet Connection and a
          MERG Connection, the Defaults pane lets you select which connection
          you want to use for a particular purpose.</p>
      <p>The Internal connection is the default connection, however, since this
          is almost always undesirable, JMRI applications will notify you if the
          Internal connection is the default for every purpose. To silence this
          notification, edit the profile properties, setting the property
          <code>jmri-managers.allInternalDefaults</code> to <em>true</em>.</p>


      <a name="FileLocations" id="FileLocations"></a>
      <h2>File Locations</h2>These allow you to set the default
      location for where scripts and user files are loaded and
      saved to.

      <p>Note that when changing the "User Files Location" this
      will also change the default location for where the following
      are stored:</p>

      <dl>
        <dd>Panels<br>

      <p>There's a <a href=
      "../../html/setup/Dropbox.shtml">separate Help page</a> with
      information on sharing files between computers using Dropbox.
      <a name="Startup" id="Startup"></a></p>

      <h2>Start Up</h2>

      <p><em>Start Up</em> preferences allow windows and files to
      be opened, scripts to be run, and additional buttons to be
      placed on the main window when the application starts.</p>

      <p>Click the <strong>Add &#9662;</strong> button and select
      the type of start up action to add. The new action will be
      added last.</p>

      <p>Start up action order is important. In most cases, scripts
      should be the last items in the start up order. Start up
      order can be changed by selecting a start up item and moving
      it <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> in the list.</p>

      <p>There are five types of start up actions:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Perform action</dt>

        <dd>Have the program automatically execute various menu
        selections at startup. For example, you can have the
        Turnout Table automatically open, or automatically open a
        window for programming on the main.</dd>

        <dt>Add button to main window</dt>

        <dd>Add extra buttons to the main JMRI window that are
        connected to specific actions in menus for easy and quick
        access to that action.</dd>

        <dt>Open file</dt>

        <dd>Automatically load panel files when the program starts
        up. You can load as many panel files as you'd like; each
        will be completely loaded before the next is started.</dd>

        <dt>Run script</dt>

        <dd>Automatically run a scripts when the program starts up.
        You can run as many scripts as you'd like; each will be run
        to completion before the next is started. Note that any
        files the script depends upon need to be opened before
        running the script.</dd>

        <dt>Set route</dt>

        <dd>Set a route when the program starts. You can set as
        many routes as you like; each will be set in order. Note
        that any files the route depends upon need to be opened
        before setting the route.</dd>
      </dl><a name="Display" id="Display"></a>

      <h2>Display</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>GUI</dt>

        <dd>
          A row of radio boxes allow you to select how the program
          looks. The available choices depend on what kind of
          computer you have, and not all of the following may be
          available:

          <ul>
            <li>Metal - the default Java style, usable on all
            computers</li>

            <li>CDE/Motif - A Linux/Unix form that works well with
            X Windows screen managers. It's also available on
            (almost) all computer types.</li>

            <li>Windows - only available on Microsoft Windows
            systems, this makes the program look as much as
            possible like a regular Windows application.</li>

            <li>Mac OS X - only available on MacOS, this makes the
            program look like a Macintosh application.</li>
          </ul>

          <br>

          In addition, this tab lets you set:
          <ul>
          <li>The font size of the GUI.</li>
          <li>Whether you want to use graphics to show the state of turnouts,
          lights, sensors and blocks in the state column of their tables.
          <span class="since">since 4.7.4</span></li>
          <li>How long tooltips (where available) should be shown.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Locale</dt>

        <dd><a href="../../Acknowledgements.shtml">Many people</a>
        have contributed "internationalizations" of JMRI. This
        converts (much) of the text on the screen to a language
        other thank English. If you select your country or region
        and language here, then save and restart the preferences,
        JMRI will use an internationalization for that country and
        language if it's available. Items that have not been
        translated will continue to appear in English, so you won't
        miss anything. For more information on how to set this up,

        <dt>Console</dt>

        <dd>This allows you to customize the way that the JMRI
        System Console looks. It is possible to select from a
        number of pre-defined color schemes and to choose the font
        size and style. Also, you can choose to save both the size
        and location of the System Console window so that it always

          The DecoderPro programmer allows you to select how much
          or how little to display of the decoder content using
          configurable "Programmers". You can choose the Basic or
          Comprehensive interface when <a href=
          "../../html/apps/DecoderPro/Roster.shtml">choosing your
          Locomotive decoder</a>, but this provides a convenient
          place to set a default so you don't have to select it
          each time you open a decoder.

          <p>This section also has checkboxes for options:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>"Show empty Programmer tabs": This lets you decide
              whether the DecoderPro programmer will display empty
              panes (tabs). Some people like to see them, even though
              they're empty; some people would prefer not to see them,
              so they don't keep trying to open and look at them. We provide
              this preference so you can choose.

          <li>"Show CV numbers in tool tips": If you allow the mouse
                cursor to "hover" over a value in DecoderPro, a tool tip
                pops up with more information.  Checking this box
                includes the CV number in that tool tip.  Some people
                want to know the CV number, other people want DecoderPro
                to handle CVs entirely invisibly,
                so we provide an option to let you choose.

          <li>"Allow caching when writing index CVs for read or write
                operations": Some decoders require that specific values
                be written to "index" CVs before certain other locations can be
                read or written. QSI and ESU decoders use this extensively.
                When doing a lot of reads or writes, for example an entire
                decoder, the index CVs can end up being written with the
                same value many times in a row.  When selected, this
                option allows DecoderPro to skip (save time on) writes
                of the same index value that are otherwise redundant.
                Don't use this (or use it only in combination with the
                following operation) if you have reliability problems
                writing decoders, as proper operation of this option depends on reliable writes.
                <p>
                More detail:  A single bad write with this option off trashes
                one CV; writing a bad index with this option off trashes the CV that was supposed
                to be written and the wrong one addressed by the bad write,
                but the write to the next CV in the sequence is OK due to the
                redundant next write of the index; writing a bad
                index with this option on leaves that badly-written index value in place, so writes a sequence
                of bad CV values. Bottom line:  If working with a complicated
                decoder with lots of CVs, you need a reliable programming connection, see next option.

          <li>"When possible, confirm CV writes by following this with a read":
               When selected, DecoderPro will read each CV after writing it.
               If the value doesn't match, it marks the write as failed.
               <p>If you're having intermittent trouble writing to a decoder, this
               may improve reliability. If DecoderPro is never able to properly write,
               this won't help; it only helps if the problem is occasional,
               and retrying will get it right more often than not.
               <p>Some DCC systems will check for a "write acknowledge pulse"
               from the decoder before declaring the write a success.
               Those are almost as reliable as this, and much faster.
               So if you're using one of those DCC systems, this might
               not be needed.
               On the other hand, if you're using a DCC system that
               "writes blind", with no check, this might be really useful.
               To tell if you have one of those, try writing CVs with
               the locomotive off the track.  If DecoderPro thinks the write
               succeeded, then the DCC system is writing blindly, without checking.
               <p>This doesn't help (but doesn't hurt) if you can't read back
               the decoder. Most DCC systems can't read during ops mode
               programming, for example. Some command stations (Digitrax DB150)
               can't read from the decoder. In those cases, this option
               just asks the command station to write without reading back.
          </ul>
          These options are stored with the preferences for future use.  A new DecoderPro Roster window
          will pick up new values of the options, without having to close and restart the program.
        </dd>

        <dt>Roster</dt>

        <dd>
          Normally, the Roster is stored in a standard location as
          part of the <a href=
          "../../html/apps/DecoderPro/Files.shtml">Preferences
          directory</a>. This option lets you move that somewhere
          else.

          <p>To configure it, click the "Set..." button and follow
          the directions.</p>

          <p>The "Reset" button restores it to the default
          location. Note that this just changes where the program
          looks. If you've stored roster information elsewhere and
          want it back in the default location, you have to move
          the files there yourself.</p>

          <p>You can also enter a default value for the "Owner"
          field in DecoderPro roster entries here. This fills in
          the value for new entries, which can save you a little
          bit of typing. It has no effect on existing entries, even
          if changed.</p>

      <h2>Warrants</h2>
      <p>This tab sets parameters used in computing
      routes and speed changes for <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/logix/Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a>
      and for controlling the events that warranted trains may
      encounter.</p>

      <h3>Speed Name Tables</h3>
      <p>When an automatically running train encounters a Signal
      aspect that calls for a speed change, the speed map table 
      provides the information of what the speed change should
      be. Other parameters control the way the
      speed change is made.</p>

      <h2>Aspect Speed Name Table</h2>
      <p>The Aspect Speed Name Table maps the speed names found in the aspects
      definition of a signal system to a value. It is important
      that all the speed names used in your signal system be listed
      in the Speed Map Table.  Rows can be added or deleted to conform
      to the Signal System aspects.</p>
      
      <p>The value associated with a speed
      name can be interpreted in four different ways and there are 
      four radio buttons for you to choose the meaning
      of the value.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Percent Normal</b> - the value is a
      percentage of the current throttle setting as recorded or set
      by an NXWarrant.  That is a percentage of the "Normal" speed.</li>
        <li><b>Percent Throttle</b> - the value is a percentage of the
        full throttle setting.</li>
        <li><b>Miles per hour</b> - the value is an absolute
        scale speed in miles per hour.</li>
        <li><b>Kilometers per hour</b> - the value is an absolute
        scale speed in kilometers per hour.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Choosing the interpretation is a matter of what you want to
      happen when a warranted train reaches a signal or block aspect.
      Percent Normal will always make the train change speed and
      Percent Throttle most likely will also.  The last two choices
      are the most prototypical, but if the train is already within
      the speed limit called for, no speed change will occur.</p>

      <h2>Head Appearance Name Table</h2>
      <p>The <b>Head Appearance Table</b> is used when Signal Heads
      are used as signals. It maps signal head appearance names 
      to aspect speed name which in turn are mapped by the Aspect
      Speed Name table to values that interpret speed limits.</p>

      <h3>Layout Scale and Search Depth</h3>
      <p>It is important that the correct <b>Layout Scale</b> is
      chosen since it is needed to convert throttle settings 
      and track speeds to and from scale speeds.<br>
      The <b>Max Number of Blocks in Route</b> is the depth to which
      JMRI will search for a route when defining a warrant. This is
      a global value that can be overridden when creating a
      warrant.</p>

      <h3>Ramping Speed changes</h3>
      The smoothness for slow down and
      speed up are done by stepping up and down with two "ramp"
      parameters; the throttle increment per step and the time
        interval of each step.  These two parameters are paired to
        make a "stair step" pattern for changing speed.  
        Generally, they are paired in that a small throttle increment
        should be done in a short time interval and a large increment
        in a longer time. When setting them, the time interval should
        be long enough for the speed increment to complete given the 
        momentum you have programmed into your decoders.
	  <ul>
        <li><b>Ramp Step throttle Increment</b>  This value is
        a ratio of full throttle. Seven or eight speed steps of a
        128 step throttle is an appropriate increment for a
        locomotive with modest momentum. A value of 0.008 to 0.04 is
        recommended. (0.0079 would be 1 step of a 128 step throttle)</li>

        <li><b>Ramp Step time</b> Depending how you have
        configured momentum on your
        locomotives, adjust this value so the speed change is 
        completed within this period of time. Typically
        corresponding to the above, 
        300 to 1000 milliseconds would be appropriate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You should experiment by watching how NXWarrants start and end
       or by issuing "Stop" and "Resume" commands to a recorded
      warrant.</p>
       
      <h3>Throttle Factor</h3>
      <p>The value of <b>Throttle Setting/Speed Factor</b>
      along with <b>Layout Scale</b>
      adjusts a throttle setting to be a layout track speed. 
      The Throttle Factor set here is a global default.</p>

      Warrant Speeds</a> and follow its links.</p>
      
      <h2>Merging Speed Profiles</h2>
      <p>In Release 4.9.2 Warrant compute a track speed when traversing
      a path with known length and known throttle setting.  These 
      measurements are made for each address that is rub under a
      warrant and are kept for the entire layout session.  When
      JMRI is quit, at shutdown. These Session Speed Profiles can
      be merged into their Roster Speed Profiles.  The following
      choices are available at shutdown.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Don't Merge</b> - Do not prompt and 
        discard the Session Profiles and
        leave the Roster Speed Profiles unchanged. </li>
        <li><b>Prompt Merges</b> - At shutdown at dialog is presented
        where you may choose which speed profiles shoud be merged and
        which discarded.  The dialog allows you to view the profiles
        for each address.  Displayed are: the current <b>Roster Speed
        Profile</b>, the potential <b>Merged Speed Profile</b> and the
        <b>Session Speed Profile</b>. (default)</li>
        <li><b>Merge All</b> - Do not prompt and always merge all
        Session Speed Profiles into the Roster Speed Profiles.</li>
      </ul>
