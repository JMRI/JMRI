      <h1>JMRI: Preferences Pane</h1>

      <p>The Preferences pane is where you configure the basic operation of your JMRI
      application.</p>

      <p>The screen is split into two sections: on the left hand side is a list of the Preference
      groups that can be set. Clicking on each item will then populate the right hand side with the
      various options that can be configured for that Tab.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the most important control is at the bottom of this section: The
      <strong>Save</strong> button!</p>

      <p>Be sure to click <strong>Save</strong> before leaving this window. Your changes to the
      Preferences don't take effect until the program is stopped and restarted, so the program will
      prompt you to do that after saving the Preferences.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">

      <p>Some preferences take effect when changed but will later display a reminder prompt to save
      the changes before quitting.</p>

      <h2 id="Connection">Connections</h2>

      <div>
        <p>You can select any of the various JMRI layout Connections here.</p>

        <p><a href="../../html/setup/images/PrefsConnections_en.png"><img src=
        "../../html/setup/images/PrefsConnections_en.png" height="195" width="425" class=
        "floatRight" alt="JMRI v2.14 Connection Prefs tab"></a> Each connection has its own unique
        tab. To get started, first select your DCC System Manufacturer, followed by the type of
        Connection that you are using. You will then be presented with a series of most commonly
        required settings that need to be set. If you need to change some of the more advanced
        settings for this connection, check the "Additional Connection Settings" box (where
        available).</p>

        <p>To add an new layout Connection, in the Connections pane click on the tab with a "+",
        this will then present you with a fresh connection tab. To remove a Connection, in the
        System Manufacturer drop down list, select <strong>(none selected)</strong> to just clear
        your present choices and enter new ones, or click on the small "x" in the Tab name to
        delete the Connection.</p>

        <p>For more information on how to configure this for your particular hardware, see the
        <a href="../../html/hardware/index.shtml">Hardware Help pages</a>.</p>

        <p>Remember to press <strong>Save</strong>!</p>
      </div>
      <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

      <h2 id="Defaults" style="clear:both">Defaults</h2>

      <div>
        <a href="images/JMRI_PrefsDefaults.png"><img src="images/JMRI_PrefsDefaults.png" height=
        "236" width="468" class="floatRight" alt="JMRI v4.15 Defaults Prefs tab"></a>
        <p>If you are using multiple connections, e.g. a LocoNet Connection and a SPROG Connection,
        the Defaults pane lets you select which connection you want to use for a particular
        purpose. For example, you can select one connection (LocoNet in the figure) for train
        throttles and consists, while using a different one (SPROG in the figure) for the service
        mode programming track.</p>

        <p>For most Layout objects there is no default connection. Every time you create a Turnout,
        Signal or Sensor, you can choose which system ( eg. LocoNet or MERG ) it belongs to.</p>

        <p>The Internal connection can be selected as a default. To avoid a common
        mis-configuration, JMRI applications will notify you if the Internal connection is selected
        across all the columns. If you choose to use an all-Internal set of defaults and want to
        silence this notification, edit the profile properties, setting the property
        <code>jmri-managers.allInternalDefaults</code> to <em>true</em>.</p>

      <h2 id="FileLocations">File Locations</h2>

      <div>
        <p>These allow you to set the default location for where scripts and user files are loaded
        and stored.</p>

        <p>Note that when changing the <strong>User Files Location</strong>, this will also change
        the default location for where the following are stored:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Tables and panels</li>

          <li>Rosters — also see <a href="#rostertab">Roster Preferences, Roster tab</a>

      <h2 id="Startup">Start Up</h2>

      <div>
        <p><em>Start Up</em> preferences allow windows and files to be opened, scripts to be run,
        and additional buttons to be placed on the main window when the application starts.<br>
        A very common use is an Open File action (see below) to automatically load your last stored
        <a href="../jmri/jmrit/display/PanelMenuHelp.shtml">layout configuration file</a> at
        startup, so all your turnouts, sensors, panels etc. are available again.</p>

        <p>Click the <strong>Add ▾</strong> button and select the type of start up action to add.
        The new action will be added last.</p>

        <p>Start up action order is important. In most cases, scripts should be the last items in
        the start up order. Start up order can be changed by selecting a start up item and moving
        it <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> in the list.</p>
        <a href="images/PrefsStartup4_15.png"><img src="images/PrefsStartup4_15.png" height="232"
        width="466" class="floatRight" alt="JMRI v4.2 Roster Prefs tab"></a>
        <p>There are seven types of start up actions:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Add button to main window...</dt>

          <dd>Add extra buttons to the main PanelPro window that are connected to specific actions
          in menus for easy and quick access to that action.</dd>

          <dt>Add script to button...</dt>

          <dd>Add extra buttons to the main PanelPro window to start scripts.</dd>

          <dt>Open file...</dt>

          <dd>Automatically load a PanelPro xml data file or Configuration file when the program
          starts up. You can load as many files as you'd like; each will be completely loaded
          before the next is started.</dd>

          <dt>Pause...</dt>

          <dd>Wait a number of seconds before running the following start up actions. An example is
          waiting for script to finish running.</dd>

          <dt>Perform action...</dt>

          <dd>Have the program automatically execute various menu selections at startup. For
          example, you can have the Turnout Table automatically open, or automatically open a
          window for programming on the main.</dd>

          <dt>Run script...</dt>

          <dd>Automatically run a scripts when the program starts up. You can run as many scripts
          as you'd like; each will be run to completion before the next is started. Note that any
          files the script depends upon need to be loaded before running the script.</dd>

          <dt>Set route...</dt>

          <dd>Set a route when the program starts. You can set as many routes as you like; each
          will be set in order. Note that any files the route depends upon need to be loaded before
          setting the route.</dd>

            A row of radio boxes allow you to select how the program looks. The available choices
            depend on what kind of computer you have, and not all of the following may be
            available:
            <ul>
              <li>Nimbus — An alternate style</li>

              <li>Metal — the default Java style, usable on all computers</li>

              <li>CDE/Motif — A Linux/Unix form that works well with X Windows screen managers.
              It's also available on (almost) all computer types.</li>

              <li>Windows — only available on Microsoft Windows systems, this makes the program
              look as much as possible like a regular Windows application.</li>

              <li>Mac OS X — only available on MacOS, this makes the program look like a Macintosh
              application.</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, this tab lets you set:
            <ul>
              <li>Font size — The font size of the GUI.</li>

              <li>Use non-standard release event for mouse click? — Provide alternate mouse
              behavior for specific hardware.</li>

              <li>Use icons to show state in tables — Whether you want to use graphics to show the
              state of turnouts, lights, sensors and blocks in the state column of their
              tables.</li>

            <a href="../../Acknowledgements.shtml">Many people</a> have contributed
            "internationalizations" of JMRI. This converts (much) of the text on the screen to a
            language other than English. If you select your country or region and language here,
            then save and restart the preferences, JMRI will use an internationalization for that
            country and language if it's available. Items that have not been translated will
            continue to appear in English, so you won't miss anything. For more information on how

          <dt>Programmer tab</dt>

          <dd>
            The DecoderPro programmer allows you to select how much or how little to display of the
            decoder content using configurable "Programmers". You can choose the Basic or
            Comprehensive interface when <a href="../../html/apps/DecoderPro/Roster.shtml">choosing
            your Locomotive decoder</a>, but this provides a convenient place to set a default so
            you don't have to select it each time you open a decoder.
            <p>This section also has checkboxes for options:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>"Show empty Programmer tabs": This lets you decide whether the DecoderPro
              programmer will display empty panes (tabs). Some people like to see them, even though
              they're empty; some people would prefer not to see them, so they don't keep trying to
              open and look at them. We provide this preference so you can choose.</li>

              <li>"Show CV numbers in tool tips": If you allow the mouse cursor to "hover" over a
              value in DecoderPro, a tool tip pops up with more information. Checking this box
              includes the CV number in that tool tip. Some people want to know the CV number,
              other people want DecoderPro to handle CVs entirely invisibly, so we provide an
              option to let you choose.</li>

              <li>"Allow caching when writing index CVs for read or write operations": Some
              decoders require that specific values be written to "index" CVs before certain other
              locations can be read or written. QSI and ESU decoders use this extensively. When
              doing a lot of reads or writes, for example an entire decoder, the index CVs can end
              up being written with the same value many times in a row. When selected, this option
              allows DecoderPro to skip (save time on) writes of the same index value that are
              otherwise redundant. Don't use this (or use it only in combination with the following
              operation) if you have reliability problems writing decoders, as proper operation of
              this option depends on reliable writes.
                <p>More detail: A single bad write with this option off trashes one CV; writing a
                bad index with this option off trashes the CV that was supposed to be written and
                the wrong one addressed by the bad write, but the write to the next CV in the
                sequence is OK due to the redundant next write of the index; writing a bad index
                with this option on leaves that badly-written index value in place, so writes a
                sequence of bad CV values. Bottom line: If working with a complicated decoder with
                lots of CVs, you need a reliable programming connection, see next option.</p>
              </li>

              <li>"When possible, confirm CV writes by following this with a read": When selected,
              DecoderPro will read each CV after writing it. If the value doesn't match, it marks
              the write as failed.
                <p>If you're having intermittent trouble writing to a decoder, this may improve
                reliability. If DecoderPro is never able to properly write, this won't help; it
                only helps if the problem is occasional, and retrying will get it right more often
                than not.</p>

                <p>Some DCC systems will check for a "write acknowledge pulse" from the decoder
                before declaring the write a success. Those are almost as reliable as this, and
                much faster. So if you're using one of those DCC systems, this might not be needed.
                On the other hand, if you're using a DCC system that "writes blind", with no check,
                this might be really useful. To tell if you have one of those, try writing CVs with
                the locomotive off the track. If DecoderPro thinks the write succeeded, then the
                DCC system is writing blindly, without checking.</p>

                <p>This doesn't help (but doesn't hurt) if you can't read back the decoder. Most
                DCC systems can't read during ops mode programming, for example. Some command
                stations (Digitrax DB150) can't read from the decoder. In those cases, this option
                just asks the command station to write without reading back.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            These options are stored with the preferences for future use. A new DecoderPro Roster
            window will pick up new values of the options, without having to close and restart the
            program.
          </dd>

          <dt id="rostertab">Roster tab</dt>

          <dd>
            Normally, the Roster is stored in a standard location as part of the <a href=
            "#FileLocations">User Files Location</a>. This option lets you move that somewhere
            else.
            <p>To configure it, click the "Set..." button and follow the directions.</p>

            <p>The "Reset" button restores it to the default location. Note that this just changes
            where the program looks. If you've stored roster information somewhere else and want it

      <h2 id="Warrants">Warrants</h2>

      <div>
        <p>This tab sets parameters used in computing routes and speed changes for <a href=
        "../../package/jmri/jmrit/logix/Warrant.shtml">Warrants</a> and for controlling the events
        that warranted trains may encounter.</p>

        <h3>Speed Name Tables</h3>

        <p>When an automatically running train encounters a Signal aspect that calls for a speed
        change, the speed map table provides the information of what the speed change should be.
        Other parameters control the way the speed change is made.</p>

        <h4>Aspect Speed Name Table</h4>

        <p>The Aspect Speed Name Table maps the speed names found in the aspects definition of a
        signal system to a value. It is important that all the speed names used in your signal
        system be listed in the Speed Map Table. Rows can be added or deleted to conform to the
        Signal System aspects.</p>

        <p>The value associated with a speed name can be interpreted in four different ways when
        a signal aspect requires a speed change.
        There are four radio buttons for you to choose the meaning of the value.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Percent Normal</strong> - the value is a percentage of the current throttle
          setting as recorded or set by an NXWarrant in the command script. That is,
          a percentage of the "Normal" scripted speed.</li>

          <li><strong>Percent Throttle</strong> - the value is a percentage of the full throttle
          setting.</li>

          <li><strong>Miles per hour</strong> - the value is an absolute scale speed in miles per
          hour.</li>

          <li><strong>Kilometers per hour</strong> - the value is an absolute scale speed in
          kilometers per hour.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Choosing the interpretation is a matter of what you want to happen when a warranted
        train reaches a signal or block aspect. Percent Normal will always make the train change
        speed and Percent Throttle most likely will also. The last two choices are the most
        prototypical, but if the train is already within the speed limit called for, no speed
        change will occur.</p>

        <h4>Head Appearance Name Table</h4>

        <p>The <strong>Head Appearance Table</strong> is used when Signal Heads are used as
        signals. It maps signal head appearance names to aspect speed name which in turn are mapped
        by the Aspect Speed Name table to values that interpret speed limits.</p>

        <h3>Layout Scale and Search Depth</h3>

        <p>It is important that the correct <strong>Layout Scale</strong> is chosen since it is
        needed to convert throttle settings and track speeds to and from scale speeds.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Max Number of Blocks in Route</strong> is the depth to which JMRI will
        search for a route when defining a warrant. This is a global value that can be overridden
        when creating a warrant.</p>

        <h3>Ramping Speed changes</h3>

        <p>The smoothness for slow down and speed up are done by stepping up and down with two
        "ramp" parameters; the throttle increment per step and the time interval of each step.
        These two parameters are paired to make a "stair step" pattern for changing speed.
        Generally, they are paired in that a small throttle increment should be done in a short
        time interval and a large increment in a longer time. When setting them, the time interval
        should be long enough for the speed increment to complete given the momentum you have
        programmed into your decoders.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ramp Step throttle Increment</strong> This value is a percentage of full throttle.
          Seven or eight speed steps of a 128 step throttle is an appropriate increment for a
          locomotive with modest momentum. A value of 3.0% to 5.0% is recommended. (0.08% would
          be 1 step of a 128 step throttle)</li>

          <li><strong>Ramp Step time</strong> Depending how you have configured momentum on your
          locomotives, adjust this value so the speed change is completed within this period of
          time. Typically corresponding to the above, 1000 milliseconds would be
          appropriate.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should experiment by watching how NX Warrants start and end or by issuing "Stop" and
        "Resume" commands to a recorded warrant.</p>

        <h3>Throttle Factor</h3>

        <p>The value of <strong>Throttle Setting/Speed Factor</strong> along with <strong>Layout
        Scale</strong> adjusts a throttle setting to be a layout track speed. The Throttle Factor
        set here is a global default.</p>

        <p>For more information on Warrant speed parameters, see <a href=
        "../jmri/jmrit/logix/SpeedChanges.shtml">Modifying Warrant Speeds</a> and follow its
        links.</p>

        <h3>Merging Speed Profiles</h3>

        <p><span class="since">since 4.19.2</span>Warrants can compute a track speed when 
        traversing a path with known length and known throttle setting.
        These measurements are made for each Roster Id that is run under
        a warrant and are kept for the entire layout session. When JMRI is quit, at shutdown, these
        Session Speed Profiles may be merged into their Roster Speed Profiles. The following
        choices are available at shutdown.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Don't Merge</strong> - Do not prompt and discard the Session Profiles and
          leave the Roster Speed Profiles unchanged.</li>

          <li><strong>Prompt Merges</strong> - At shutdown at dialog is presented where you may
          choose which speed profiles shoud be merged and which discarded. The dialog allows you to
          view the profiles for each address. Displayed are: the current <strong>Roster Speed
          Profile</strong>, the potential <strong>Merged Speed Profile</strong> and the
          <strong>Session Speed Profile</strong>. (default)</li>

          <li><strong>Merge All</strong> - Do not prompt and always merge all Session Speed
          Profiles into the Roster Speed Profiles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tracing Warrant Activity</h3>

        <p><span class="since">since 4.24.5</span>A record of the warrants that have been run can
        be output to the console. This can be done in lieu of using the "Open Session Log" menu
        item to write the record to file. Press this button to enable or disable the feature.</p>

        <h3>Slow Speed Assistance</h3>

        <p><span class="since">since 4.24.5</span>The ramping parameters and speed interpretation
        apply to all locomotives when speed changes are required by signal aspects, obstacles 
        ahead or a user "Halt" control command. You may have a balky engine in your fleet that 
        may not perform well at low throttle settings. Should such a speed be specified before entering
        a block, the engine might stall and never get there. "Slow Speed Assistance" can be 
        given when a train is inordinately late in getting to the next block of the script. 
        This done only when the train approaching the block has a speed less than a specified 
        throttle setting. If the train has not reached the block within 10 seconds of its scheduled 
        script time, its speed is increased by one "Ramp Step Throttle Increment". This is 
        done at 10 second intervals until either the train reaches the block or has
        attained the specified throttle speed. Upon entering the block the original script
        speed is restored.</p>
        <p>The default setting for triggering Slow Speed Assistance is 10% throttle.
        Slow Speed Assistance is disabled by setting the trigger speed to 0%.</p>
