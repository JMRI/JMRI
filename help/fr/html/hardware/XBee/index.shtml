      <p>The <a href="http://www.digi.com/xbee">Digi International
      XBee Modules</a> are family of wireless communication devices
      that have their own microcontroller and IO pins that make
      them useful for many distributed control networks, including
      on model railroads.</p>

      <a name="hardware" id="hardware"></a>
      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <h3>Command Station</h3>

      <p>JMRI can communicate with XBee Series 1 and XBee Series 2

      <a name="connecting" id="connecting"></a>
      <h2>Connecting</h2>

      <h3>Wiring</h3>

      <p>JMRI can communicate with XBee Series 1 and XBee Series 2
      modules.</p>

      <p>In JMRI versions prior to 4.5.5, underlying support for
      communication is provided by 
      <a href="https://github.com/andrewrapp/xbee-api">Andrew Rapp's
      xbee-api library for Java</a>.</p>

      <p>Starting with JMRI version 4.5.5, the Underlying support for
      communication is provided by <a href="http://docs.digi.com/display/XBJLIB/XBee+Java+Library">The Digi XBee Java Library</a>.

      <p>Both library requires that the
      XBee module connected to the PC be configured for API
      mode with escapes (mode 2).</p>

      <p>JMRI support for the Digi XBee Modules currently includes
      the ability to passively read digital sensor inputs, as JMRI
      Sensors, and triggering digital outputs, through the JMRI
      Lights and Turnouts.</p>

      <h3>XBee Module Addressing</h3>

      <p>Each XBee module has 5 addresses we need to be aware
      of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a Channel Number</li>

        <li>a 16 bit PAN address</li>

        <li>a 16 bit User address</li>

        <li>a 64 bit Globally Unique ID</li>

        <li>a free-form Node Identifier string</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The IEEE 802.15.4 Channel Number is set by configuring the
      XBee's CH parameter. The value of the CH parameter can be any
      (hex) value from 0x0B to 0x1A. This corresponds to decimal
      values 11 to 26. All XBee modules in the network must be set
      to the same channel number.</p>

      <p>The 16 bit PAN (Personal Area Network) address is assigned
      by setting the XBee's ID parameter. All XBee modules in the
      network must be set to use the same PAN.</p>

      <p>The 16 bit user address is defined by the XBee's MY
      parameter. Some XBee firmware will automatically set the
      value of MY to be a unique address on the network, but others
      do not. If the My parameter is user configurable, it should
      be a unique address.</p>

      <p>The 64 bit globally unique id (GUID) is defined by the
      factory. This value is the hex string printed on the
      underside of each XBee module. You can also read the value by
      reading the SH (Serial Number High) and SL (Serial Number
      Low) parameters of the XBee. The user cannot change the
      values of SH and SL.</p>

      <p>The free-form Node Identifier is a 20 character text value
      stored in the XBee's NI parameter. The Node Identifier should
      be unique, and may be human readable.</p>

      <p>Note: You need to be aware of other devices using IEEE
      802.15.4 radio networks that may be operating in the same
      area. Digitrax Duplex throttles and Roco MultiMaus Pro radio
      throttles both use IEEE 802.15.4 as the underlying network
      layer protocol. If these devices share a PAN and channel with
      your XBee modules, the devices are all a part of the same
      network, and the 16 bit user address must be unique.</p>

      <h3>Input/Output pin addressing</h3>

      <p>When creating inputs (Sensors) and outputs (either Lights
      or Turnouts) in JMRI, the XBee's IO pins can be individually
      addressed. To access a single bit, you can use the form:</p>

      <p><code>ModuleAddress:Pin</code></p>

      <p>Where ModuleAddress is one of the 16 bit node address, the
      64 bit node address, or the Node Identifier string and Pin is
      an XBee IO pin number.</p>

      <p>Turnouts may be created using two bits. To specify a
      turnout created with two bits, you use the following
      format:</p>

      <p><code>ModuleAddress:Pin1:Pin2</code></p>

      <p>Where ModuleAddress is one of the 16 bit node address, the
      64 bit node address, or the Node Identifier string and Pin1
      and Pin2 are XBee IO pin numbers. The Pin numbers do not need
      to be consecutive.</p>

      <h3>Automatic Creation of Sensors</h3>

      <p>When an XBee input status message is received indicating
      one ( or more ) of the XBee IO Pins is used as an input, JMRI
      will automatically create a sensor for each input pin if it
      does not already exist.</p>

      <p>When sensors are created automatically, the Node
      Identifier will be used for the ModuleAddress if it is not
      blank. If the Node Identifier is blank, the 16 bit MY address
      field will be used for the ModuleAddress unless the MY
      address field contains a broadcast address. If neither the
      Node Identifier or the 16 bit MY Address are used for the
      ModuleAddress, the 64 bit GUID will be used for the
      ModuleAddress.</p>

      <h3>Adding an item to the table</h3>
      <p>When you add an item to one of the tables, many times you only
        have to fill in the numbers to have JMRI construct
        the complete system name.<br>
        Here's a summary, split up for
        outputs (eg. Turnouts) and inputs (eg. Sensors):</p>

      <h3>Software settings</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Connect your XBee adapter using the appropriate
        cable.</li>

        <li>USB-connected XBee adapters may need to have a driver
        installed. See the documentation provided by the
        manufacturer of your XBee Adapter.</li>

        <li>Make sure you have the latest version of JMRI, then go
        to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program. This
        opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you
        can select it from the "Edit" menu</li>

        <li>Select "IEEE 802.15.4 Network" from the System
        Manufacturer selection box.</li>

        <li>Select "XBee Network" from the System Connection
        selection box.</li>

        <li>You can then select the proper serial port in the
        Serial port selection box under Settings.<br>
        Note that USB XBee adapters will appear as a serial
        port.</li>

        <li>The "Connection Prefix" is used to help JMRI
        communicate separately with multiple "connections" to
        layout hardware. Each "connection" must have a unique
        identifier, which is specified as the "Connection Prefix".
        By default, the first XBee connection is given a prefix of
        "Z", and additional XBee networks are given prefixes like
        "Z1", "Z2", ... Most users should be able to use the
        default "Connection Prefix" value provided by the JMRI
        tools.</li>

        <li>When a JMRI tool is configured for more than one
        connection, each connection gets a menu item on the main
        JMRI tool window. To help users differentiate between their
        different connections, each connection has a "Connection
        Name", which is used as the name of the associated menu
        item on the main JMRI tool window. Users may change the
        "Connection Name" for any connection to suit their
        needs.</li>

        <li>The XBee adapter "Additional Connection Settings"
        provides access to the Baud rate for the connection. Make
        sure the selected Baud rate matches the port speed setting
        of your XBee.</li>

        <li>The "Configure XBee Nodes" button opens the <a href=
        "XBeeNodeConfigurationTool.shtml">XBee Node Configuration
        tool</a>. If you save Preferences after Nodes are created,
        node address information will be stored with the JMRI
        Preferences.</li>

        <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the
        program to quit; click "Yes".</li>

        <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>
