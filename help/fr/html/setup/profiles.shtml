<h1>JMRI Setup: Configuration Profiles</h1>

<p><em>Configuration Profiles</em> allow a single JMRI application to be launched
    with one of multiple user-specified configurations. A configuration profile
    contains all preferences set in the JMRI preferences dialog, and may,
    optionally, include user files, a roster, and throttles.</p>

<p>When a JMRI application is launched for the first time, it checks for a
    configuration profile. If no profile exists, the application will create a
    default profile and use it without prompting you. If only a single profile
    is found, the application will use that profile without prompting you.
    If there are multiple profiles, the application will prompt you for the
    profile to use. You may specify that the application always start with the
    same profile.</p>

<p>By default, when a JMRI application starts up, it prompts the user 
    for which configuration profile to use: <img src="images/Set_Active_Profile.png"></p>
<p>If the user doesn't select a new profile and click OK, the program will
continue with the default profile after a short delay. You can check a box in the
preferences to bypass this step and go directly to the last-used profile.</p>

<h2>Profile Management</h2>

<p>Configuration profiles can be managed in the application preferences, under
    the Profile Configuration tab.</p>

<p>The "Currently active profile" is being used by this run of the JMRI application, 
    and is also where preferences changes will be saved.</p>

<p>To use or configure a different profile, select it, click "Activate", and restart
    the program.</p>

<p>For more information on how to configure JMRI to share its
configuration files between multiple computers, see the
<a href="Dropbox.shtml">page on using Dropbox with JMRI</a>.

<h2>Sharing Profiles</h2>
<h3>Exporting</h3>
<p>Profiles can be exported from the application preferences Config Profile
    section. An exported profile is a compressed archive containing the profile's
    contents, and will optionally contain the user files and roster if they are
    stored outside the profile.</p>
<h3>Importing</h3>
<p>JMRI does not yet directly support importing profiles.</p>
<p>A profile can be imported by uncompressing it a native archive management
    utility into a new directory and then opening while launching JMRI or from
    the application preferences by clicking the "Add Existing..." button.</p>
<p>Note that using the profile Import/Export capability to copy JMRI data back
    and forth between two computers is neither supported or recommended.</p>

<h2>Upgrading from Earlier Versions of JMRI</h2>
<p>When you first run a JMRI application after upgrading from an earlier version
    of JMRI, the application will copy its existing configuration to a new profile,
    and use that profile. If you are using a JMRI application you had not used
    prior to upgrading, the application will behave as described above.</p>
