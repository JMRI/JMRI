	    <H1>JMRI: 2007 User Poll</H1>

In late May and early June 2007, we ran three polls in the 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers">jmriusers group</a>
to learn more about what our users are actually using. 
This page reports the results.

<P>
There's likely to be a selection bias in the responses.
People who are actively involved
with JMRI are more likely to subscribe to the jmriusers group,
which was necessary to learn of the poll.  They are possibly more likely
to reply to the poll, and more likely to have a more recent version.
We should take this into account when using the results.

<P>
In the sections below, we summarize and interpret the results.
The complete 
<a href="#raw">raw data</a>
is available at the end of the page.

<h3>JMRI Version</h3>
The poll asked which version of JMRI people were using. 
The results, in decreasing order of popularity, were:

<OL>
<LI>74% 1.7.6 (The most recent test release at that time)
<LI>7% 1.7.5
<LI>5% 1.6.1 (The most recent production release)
<LI>5% I build my own version from the code
<LI>4% 1.7.4 and 1.7.3 combined
<LI>0% Test releases in the 1.7 series before 1.7.3
</OL>

One respondent (of 266) reported using "1.5 (any)", and one reported
"1.4 (any)".  These may be confusions with the Java version.
<P>
Note that 1.7.6 was the most recent test release, but it was quite old.
The most recent production release, 1.6.1, was very old.  
This may have caused more people to use the most recent test release(s) than we
would have normally found. The poll's selection bias may also have resulting
in more people listing the most recent test release(s) than is true of the
user population as a whole, thus understating 
the number of people who just download
the more recent production version and run.


<h3>Java Version</h3>
The poll asked which Java version JMRI was using. The 
results, in decreasing order of popularity, were:
<OL>
<LI>35% 1.5
<LI>33% 1.6
<LI>20% 1.4
<LI>10% 1.7
<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;0% 1.3 or earlier
</OL>
Out of 159 responses, there were zero users of Java 1.3 or earlier.
This is somewhat inconsistent with smallbut non-zero number of 
people who said they are using JMRI on original Macintosh computers, 
which use Java 1.1, but the response to this poll was small than 
to the operating system poll.
<P>
It's possible that 10% of JMRI users have downloaded test distributions
of Java 1.7 from Sun, but since Java 1.7 is not generally released yet it
seems more likely that some of those responses are confusions with the JMRI
release number.  This in turn implies that the Java 1.6 number might be a little
inflated by the same mechanism.

<h3>Operating System Version</h3>

The poll asked which operating system
and version was being using to run JMRI.
The results, in decreasing order of popularity, were:

<OL>
<LI>52% Windows XP (including SP1, SP2, Home and Professional)
<LI>13% Windows 98
<LI>11% Windows 2000
<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;9% Mac OS X - 10.4 or later
<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;8% Linux - combined types, with no clear leader among them
<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;3% Windows Vista
<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;2% Windows Millenium Edition
</OL>

There were no respondents using Windows x64, Windows NT, or Windows 95.
One respondent used "Windows Server (Any, including 2003)", 
and one "Windows (Other, including CE)".
<P>
There were four respondents (1.5%) who used Macintosh OS 8.6, 9.0 or 9.1.
All of the Mac OS X respondents were using version 10.3 (4 votes) or later (20 votes).
<P>
Among only Linux varients, the responses were:
<UL>
<LI>5 Red Hat, including Centos
<LI>4 Ubuntu
<LI>4 Debian
<LI>4 SUSE
<LI>2 Other
<LI>1 Gentoo
</UL>

<P>
Among other operating systems, there were no respondents indicating they
used OS/2, or either "Other Unix-based" or "Other non-Unix-based". 
One respondent was using Solaris.

<h4>Operating System Poll</h4>
The poll prompt was:
<P>
<I>
Which operating system do you run JMRI on? We'd like to know this to improve our testing and development. You can pick as many choices as you want, but please only select ones that you are using now, or are actually running on a computer that you're likely to put JMRI on soon.

<h4>Java Version Poll</h4>
The poll prompt was:
<P>
<I>
Which version of Java do you use when running JMRI? If you're not sure, you can find out by starting DecoderPro and looking at the 2nd line on the startup window. It'll say something like "Java version 1.5.0_07 (en_US)"; we just want the first digits, e.g. 1.5. We want this information so we can understand what language features we can and can't use in JMRI. Please only enter what you're using now, not what you plan to use or have used in the past.

<h4>JMRI Version Poll</h4>
The poll prompt was:
<P>
<I>
Which version of JMRI are you _currently_ running? If you're not sure, start DecoderPro or PanelPro and look at the startup window. It will say "DecoderPro 1.something.something, part of the JMRI Project"; that's the number we're looking for. We want this information to help us understand how far back we should make e.g. decoder files compatible. Please don't enter versions you no longer use, or just plan to use in the future; we want to know what you're using now.
