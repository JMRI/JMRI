      <h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

      <p>The JMRI Digitrax Duplex Configuration Tool provides a
      mechanism to read and modify the Duplex Group identification
      information associated with a Digitrax Duplex wireless
      network. It also can scan the Duplex channels for radio
      interference.</p>

      <p>This tool provides the same basic features as provided by
      the Digitrax program "DuplexGroupSetup". Duplex network
      "identification" information may read and changed by using
      the fields availble in the "Group Identity" tab. Scanning the
      Duplex channels for radio interference me be performed using
      the "Channel Scan" tab. Each tab is described below.</p>

      <p>If the Duplex Group identity information is changed, then
      throttles must join the network with the new identity
      information in order to communicate properly. Join the
      network using any of the mechanisms which apply for the
      throttle(s) you use.</p>

      <p>This configuration tool has no effect on Digitrax infrared
      or simplex network configuration, and has no useful effect if
      there are no UR92 devices connected to LocoNet.</p>

      <h2><a name="Disclaimer" id="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></h2>

      <p>This tool was not developed by Digitrax. This tool is not
      supported by Digitrax. The tool's original author
      reverse-engineered the operations of the DigiGroupSetup
      software package to determine how this tool should operate.
      It is not possible to guarantee that this tool will work
      properly with future Digitrax Duplex-related hardware.</p>

      <p>At the time this help page was last edited, there have
      been no reports of incompatibility.</p>

      <h2><a name="Starting" id="Starting">Starting the Duplex
      Network Configuration Tool</a></h2>

      <p>This tool is available in DecoderPro under the LocoNet
      menu, as the item "Configure Duplex Group". Other tools may
      provide different methods to start this tool.</p>

      <p>When this tool is started, the tool automatically
      determines if it can access any UR92 devcies. If the tool is
      able to find and read the UR92 Duplex Group identification
      information, the identification information is updated in the
      display. A sample is shown below.</p>

      <p><img src="SampleInitialView.png" alt=
      "Duplex Configuration Tool"></p>

      <p>If the tool cannot communicate with any UR92 devices, then
      this tool cannot provide any useful function. In this case,
      the tool disables all Duplex Group identification entry
      fields and displays a status message. This is shown (in part)
      below.</p>

      <p><img src="SampleNoUr92Found.png" alt=
      "Status message showing no UR92s found"></p>

      <p>Once LocoNet communication between the computer and the
      UR92(s) is restored, the user can press the "<b>Read Group
      Information</b>" button to re-try the UR92 query.</p>

      <p>If the tool finds more than one UR92, and they are
      configured with different Duplex Group identity information,
      then the display will show configuration information from the
      first UR92 to respond to the tool's identity query. The tool
      reports the number of UR92s found, and shows a message in the
      status line at the bottom of the tool, such as shown (in
      part) below.</p>

      <p><img src="SampleConflictingGroupIdentity.png" alt=
      "Display when UR92s have non-matching Duplex Group identity information"></p>

      <p>In this case, it is advisable to Set all of the UR92s to
      the same Duplex Group identity information by modifying the
      Duplex Group identification fields as required and then
      pressing the "<b>Set Group Information</b>" button to
      configure all UR92s to the same Duplex Group identity
      information.</p>

      <h2><a name="GroupIdTab" id="GroupIdTab">The Group Identity
      Tab</a></h2>The "Group Identity" tab is used to read and
      change the identification information associated with the
      Digitrax Duplex network. This information is used by the
      devices which support the Digitrax Duplex radio system, which
      includes the UR92, the DT402D, and the UT4D.

      <p>As fields are modified, they are marked in orange, as
      shown below:</p>

      <p><img src="./SampleChangedName.png" alt=
      "Tool showing modified fields"></p>

      <p>The "<b>Set Group Information</b>" button may be used to
      write the displayed Duplex Group identification information
      to the UR92(s). All values are checked for validity before
      being written to the UR92(s). If any invalid values are
      found, the incorrect data will be shown in red text and a
      message will be shown near the bottom of the tool, but no
      information will be written to the UR92(s).</p>

      <p>After changing the Digitrax Duplex Group identification
      information, it is necessary for each Duplex throttle to join
      the network to learn the updated identification. Rejoining
      must be done for each throttle. This tool cannot inform
      throttles that they will need to rejoin, and cannot cause
      throttles to rejoin. Rejoining can be as simple as unplugging
      and plugging each Duplex throttle into LocoNet, or done
      wirelessly on the DT402D. See DT402D throttle instructions
      for information on wirelessly joining a Duplex Group
      network.</p>

      <p>Changes to the Duplex Group identification information
      happens immediately when the UR92(s) accept the Duplex Group
      identity information. Any Duplex throttle which was
      communicating with a UR92 using the old Duplex Group
      identification information will no longer be able to
      communicate with the UR92 until it re-joins the Duplex
      network using the new Duplex Group identification
      information. Because of this, it is recommended that all
      Duplex throttle users stop their trains and exit programming
      modes as necessary before changing the Duplex Group identity
      information.</p>

      <p>To ensure that the Duplex throttles understand <i>any</i>
      changes to the Duplex Group identity information, it is
      necessary for each throttle to join the Duplex Group network.
      See throttle documentation for details on joining the Duplex
      Group network. Re-joining may be as simple as plugging the
      throttle into a LocoNet jack. Re-joining may be done on the
      DT402D throttle by "find"ing the Duplex Group name on the
      correct Duplex Group channel, and, if necessary, entering the
      Duplex Group password.</p>

      <p>The "<b>Read Group Information</b>" button may be used to
      request a read of Duplex Group identity information from
      UR92(s) on LocoNet. This will refresh the displayed Duplex
      Group identity information and UR92 count information based
      on the response(s) from the UR92 devices.</p>

      <h3><a name="Fields" id="Fields">The Duplex Group
      Identification Fields</a></h3>

      <p>A Duplex Group is identified by a Duplex Group Name, a
      Duplex Group "Password" a Duplex channel number, and a
      "Duplex Group ID". Each of these is described below.</p>

      <h4><a name="NameField" id="NameField">Duplex Group
      Name</a></h4>

      <p>The Duplex Group Name is a field of 8 characters which is
      used to help distinguish one Duplex Group network from
      another. It may be configured with an 8 character text
      message which is meaningful to the user.</p>

      <p>The Duplex Group Name is stored in the UR92(s). Each
      Duplex-capable throttle must be configured to a specific
      Duplex Group Name in order to be able to communicate with a
      UR92.</p>

      <p>If you enter a Duplex Group Name with less than 8
      characters, this tool will automatically add spaces after the
      characters you have entered to fill it out to 8 characters.
      When entering the Duplex Group Name on a DT402D, a Duplex
      Group Name of less than 8 characters must similarly be padded
      with spaces to fill it out to 8 characters.</p>

      <p>If you enter more than 8 characters, this tool will report
      an error message in the status line at the bottom of the tool
      window, as shown below. The tool will not update the Duplex
      Group identification information in the UR92(s) if this field
      (or any other field) contains unacceptable data.</p>

      <p><img src="./SampleInvalidSetting.png" alt=
      "Tool showing too many name characters"></p>

      <h4><a name="ChannelField" id="ChannelField">Duplex Group
      Channel</a></h4>

      <p>The Duplex Group Channel number controls which frequency
      band the UR92(s) and throttle(s) will use to communicate. By
      default, the UR92 uses Duplex Group Channel number 11. The
      Digitrax Duplex radio system supports channel numbers 11
      through 26 (inclusive).</p>

      <p>If an invalid Duplex Group Channel Number is entered, this
      tool will report an error message in the status line at the
      bottom of the tool window.</p>

      <p>Because there are other electronic communication systems
      which may use the same frequency bands which are available to
      the Digitrax Duplex radio system, it may be useful to select
      a Duplex Group Channel number other than the default.</p>

      <h4><a name="PasswordField" id="PasswordField">Duplex Group
      Password</a></h4>

      <p>The Duplex Group Password is a four character security
      code which can be used to control access to a Duplex Group
      network. It is stored in the UR92(s).</p>

      <p>The Duplex Group Password is always four characters. The
      Duplex Group Password may contain characters between 0 and 9
      (inclusive). Although not documented by Digitrax, the UR92
      and DT402D also support the use of the characters "A", "B",
      and "C". This tool supports use of these additional
      characters. <i>To help ensure compatibility with future
      Digitrax devices, it is advised that the password characters
      should be chosen to use only the numbers 0 through 9
      (inclusive); the letter characters should not be
      used.</i></p>

      <p>If an invalid Duplex Group Password is entered, this tool
      will report an error message in the status line at the bottom
      of the tool window.</p>

      <p>A Duplex throttle does not need to know the Duplex Group
      Password if joining a Duplex Group network by plugging into
      the LocoNet. When the Duplex Group Password is "0000",
      untethered DT402D throttles can join the Duplex Group network
      easily and without entering a Password. As such, a Duplex
      Group network which is configured with a Duplex Group
      Password of "0000" should be considered un-secured.</p>

      <p>When the Duplex Group Password is other than "0000",
      untethered throttles may only join a Duplex Group network if
      the tetherless throttle user enters the correct Duplex Group
      Password when attempting to join the network. Since UT4D
      throttles do not allow the user to enter the Duplex Group
      Password, a UT4D must be plugged into LocoNet to join a
      Duplex Group network when that network uses a Duplex Group
      Password that is other than "0000".</p>

      <p>For a variety of technical reasons, the Duplex Group
      Password cannot provide a highly-secured Duplex wireless
      network. Please do not expect the Duplex Group password
      system to prevent unauthorized users from joining the Duplex
      network.</p>

      <h4><a name="GroupIdField" id="GroupIdField">Duplex Group
      ID</a></h4>

      <p>The Duplex Group ID number is a number between 0 and 127.
      The UR92 device(s) stores and reports the Duplex Group ID
      setting. It appears that the UR92, DT402D, and UT4D do not
      make any active use of this setting. Changing the Duplex
      Group ID number does not appear to have any effect on
      operation of the Duplex Group network.</p>

      <p><i>The default Duplex Group ID setting of 0 is recommended
      to help ensure compatibility with future Digitrax
      devices.</i></p>

      <h2><a name="Scanning" id="Scanning">The Channel Scan
      Tab</a></h2>

      <p>The Channel Scan tab allows the user to temporarily use
      the UR92(s) to "scan" the Duplex Radio channels for
      interfering signal sources. Results are shown graphically, in
      a way similar to that used by the Digitrax "DigiGroupSetup"
      program.</p>

      <p>The Channel Scan is started by pressing the "<b>Scan
      Duplex Channels</b>" button. This begins a loop which scans
      each available Duplex Group channel number sequentially, then
      repeating, for a total of 25 scans of each channel. As each
      channel is scanned, the graphical chart area is updated to
      show the channel being scanned, the reported signal strength,
      and the average and maximum signal strength reported for the
      channel. The channel being scanned is indicated by a
      diamond-shaped icon which is shown just above the channel
      number near the bottom of the graphical area.</p>

      <p>The data reported by the UR92(s) is shown graphically on
      the chart, with a light blue vertical bar shown for each
      channel as it is scanned, a red horizontal line which
      represents the highest value reported for the channel, and a
      green horizontal line which represents the average value
      reported for the channel.</p>

      <p>Values higher on the chart indicate stronger interfering
      sources than values shown lower on the chart.</p>

      <p>The chart also shows a horizontal dashed yellow line,
      which corresponds roughly to the dashed yellow line shown on
      the Digigrax "DigiGroupSetup" program channel scan display.
      It is believed that this Digitrax may intend this dashed
      yellow line to represent a recommendation for maximum amount
      of interfering radio signal.</p>

      <p>The best Duplex Group channel to use is one which
      <i>never</i> has any interfering radio signals. In this case,
      the red line for the channel will be shown at the bottom of
      the chart, indicating a very low maximum interfering radio
      signal strength. In some environments, there may be not be
      any channels where the maximum interfering signal strength is
      very low. In this case, choose a Duplex Group channel number
      where the maximum interfering signal strength is lowest. It
      may be advisable to run the radio scan occasionally to
      determine that the radio signal environment has not changed
      over time.</p>

      <p>The image below shows a sample Channel Scan tab display.
      Note the diamond above the lower line showing channel numbers
      - it indicates the channel being scanned at that time.</p>

      <p><img src="SampleScanDisplay.png" alt=
      "Sample Channel Scan display"></p>

      <p>The image below shows a sample Channel Scan tab display
      which has indicates some channels which should be avoided due
      to high levels of radio signal from interfering sources.</p>

      <p><img src="SampleBadChannels.png" alt=
      "Sample Channel Scan display with bad channels"></p>

      <h3><a name="ScanningLimitations" id=
      "ScanningLimitations">Channel Scan Limitations</a></h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The UR92 mechanism which measures interfering radio
          signals is one which acts for a very short period of
          time. Many possible interfering radio signal sources only
          generate interfering signals for very short periods of
          time or at random intervals. The measurement mechanism
          can only report strength from an interfering source if
          the measurement is taken when the interfering source is
          transmitting. This makes it likely that a given scan
          operation can "miss" the signal from an interfering
          source. By executing the measurements for each channel 25
          times, the tool attempts to increase the chance of seeing
          interfering sources. The user can run additional scans
          without clearing previous scan data to increase the
          chances of measuring interfering radio signals. times</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>When the channel scan is being performed, the UR92
          cannot be relied upon to pass radio signals between
          Duplex throttles and LocoNet.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>When performing the channel scan operation, the
          UR92(s) can interpret radio traffic from Duplex throttles
          as signal sources. To prevent improper interpretation of
          Duplex throttle activity as interfering sources, remove
          batteries from all Duplex throttles and unplug them from
          LocoNet for the duration of the channel scan
          operation.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If multiple UR92s are connected to LocoNet, each one
          will report a value for the channel scan operations. The
          tool will properly update the maximum and average lines
          based on the data from channel scan reports from UR92s,
          but the light blue bar will only reflect the last scan
          report seen for the channel. So in some cases, the chart
          can show a maximum line for a channel where the light
          blue bar has only been shown at lower heights.</p>

          <p>When multiple UR92s are installed, it might be useful
          to generate a separate chart for each UR92 acting alone
          (by disconnecting all other UR92s from LocoNet and
          power), and then comparing the charts. It may be possible
          to generate separate charts to help identify possible
          stationary interference sources by relating signal
          strength seen on specific channels to UR92 location.
          Presumably, a stronger signal reading implies a closer
          interference source.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

          <p><b>Multiple UR92s with Differing Duplex Group
          Identification Information:</b> A Duplex throttle will
          only communicate with UR92s which use identical Duplex
          Group Identification information to the network which it
          has most recently joined. If any UR92 on LocoNet is
          configured differently, it will not establish
          communication with the throttle.</p>

          <p>When a Duplex throttle is plugged into LocoNet, it
          queries (reads) the Duplex Group Identification from the
          UR92. If more than one UR92 is attached to LocoNet, each
          will respond with its Duplex Group Identification
          information, but the throttle will only accept the
          information from the first response. It is impossible to
          predict which UR92 will reply first. Therefore, it is
          important for all UR92s to have the same Duplex Group
          Identification information.</p>

          <p>Any time when this tool queries (reads) the UR92
          Duplex group information, it displays only the first
          Duplex Group information which it receives. If any UR92
          reports Duplex Group information which is different from
          the first UR92 reply, this tool will provide a message in
          the status line stating that differing Duplex Group
          identification was reported, as shown above.</p>

          <p>This is an indication that at least one UR92 is
          configured with differing Duplex Group Identification -
          for best Duplex throttle operation, the user should set
          the Duplex Group information to a common identity. This
          can be done using the "Set Group Information" button or
          using the procedure documented in the Digitrax DT402D

          to a LocoNet which already has one or more UR92 devices
          installed, there can be some confusion as to which Duplex
          Group information is used - the information from the
          existing UR92(s) or from the new one. To resolve this
          issue, Digitrax recommends that the user turns track
          power off then back on when installing a new UR92. Upon
          receipt of a "Track Power On" message, the UR92s will
          negotiate and automatically change all UR92s to one of
          the sets of Duplex Group information. The Duplex Group
          information from the previously-existing UR92(s) might
          NOT win this negotiation, so the Duplex Group information
          might be set to match the new UR92.</p>

          <p>Alternately, when adding a UR92 to a LocoNet which
          already has one or more UR92 devices installed, this tool
          can be used to help configure all UR92s to the
          previously-configured settings from the old UR92(s).
          First install the new UR92 on LocoNet and then start this
          tool.</p>

          <p>If this tool shows the desired Duplex Group Identity
          information when started, simply click the "<b>Set Group
          Information</b>" button to update all UR92s to the
          desired configuration.</p>

          <p>If this tool instead shows the Duplex Group Identity
          information from the new UR92, simply click the "<b>Read
          Group Information</b>" button to re-query the system.
          Repeat this if necessary until the previously-configured
          settings from the old UR92(s) appear. Then click the
          "<b>Set Group Information</b>" button to update all UR92s
          to the desired configuration.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>UR92 Reset to Factory Default:</b> The user may
          reset a UR92 to its factory-default Duplex Group
          information by holding down the UR92's reset button for
          about 5 seconds while the UR92 is powered. The UR92's red
          and lights will flicker for a few seconds while the reset
          process completes. After resetting a UR92 to its factory
          defaults, the user may use this tool's "Read Group
          Information" to refresh the tool display. Resetting one
          UR92 has no direct effect on other UR92s on LocoNet and
          can result in use of different Duplex Group
          identification information in the UR92s. This tool's "Set
          Group Information" can be used to write the displayed
          Duplex Group identification information to all UR92s to
          ensure use of consistent Duplex Group identification
          information by all UR92s on LocoNet.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Duplex Group Identification Changes by Other
          Agents:</b> This tool's display will be updated only when
          the tool receives a response to its query for Duplex
          Group information, including the query automatically made
          when this tool is opened. If some other agent, such as a
          throttle, changes the Duplex Group information while this
          tool is open, and the changed data is later reported on
          LocoNet, this tool will display the status message
          "UR92(s) have different info than shown above." The
          tool's data entry fields will <i>not</i> be updated to
          show the information from the LocoNet message.</p>

          <p>The user may click the "<b>Read Group Information</b>"
          button to refresh the data entry fields to find the
          Duplex Group information which was modified by some other
          LocoNet agent.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Duplex Group Name Characters:</b> The DT402D can be
          used to select characters which are not normally
          available on English-based computer platforms which are
          configured for the English language. Generally,
          characters which show up on a "standard" English keyboard
          should work properly with this tool. Characters known to
          be awkward include the left-facing and right-facing
          arrows (on the DT402D display) and the tilde ("~")
          character on the PC keyboard. Operation of this tool for
          non-PC and/or non-English platforms has not been tested
          by this tool's original author. Operation of this tool
          has only been tested by the tool's original author using
          Digitrax Duplex equipment sold for use in the United
          States.</p>

        <li>
          <p><b>Duplex Group Channel Number:</b> The Duplex Group
          Channel Number is like a television channel in that each
          channel number defines a unique frequency range for
          communication. If you experience communication
          difficulties and suspect interferance from other wireless
          devices, you may change the Duplex Group channel number
          to try a different frequency range. All of the available
          Duplex Group channel numbers specify frequencies in the
          2.4 GHz "ISM" frequency range. Other wireless devices
          which operate in this frequency range include WiFi
          networks, Bluetooth devices, 2.4 GHz cordless telephones,
          some wireless video systems, and many other consumer,
          industrial, and medical wireless devices.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Duplex Group Password Characters:</b> The DT402D
          and UR92 allow use of characters "A", "B", and "C" in the
          Duplex Group Password, while Digitrax documentation
          describes the password as being a 4 digit number between
          0 and 9999. This software supports "A", "B", and "C" in
          the Duplex Group Password. When entering a Duplex Group
          Password on the DT402D keypad, the "C" character is
          entered using the pushbutton which shows both a "C" and
          the number "12", not the pushbutton marked "CLOC" and
          "c".</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Count of UR92 Devices:</b> The count of UR92s is
          used primarily to provide a display of the number of
          UR92s found. The mechanism this tool uses to count the
          number of UR92s connected to LocoNet sometimes does not
          provide an accurate count. An inaccurate count does not
          prevent operation of this tool but may indicate that the
          UR92 devices are not properly communicating with
          LocoNet.</p>

          <p>The user should compare this number against the known
          number of UR92s. If the reported count does not match the
          number of UR92s known to be installed on LocoNet, the
          count can be refreshed by clicking on the "<b>Read Group
          Information</b>" button. If the count continues to be
          wrong, check for proper LocoNet and power wiring to all
          installed UR92s.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Non-connected UR92s:</b> To the best knowledge of
          the author of this tool, it is not possible to wirelessly
          connect two separate wired LocoNet segments. To the best
          knowledge of the original author of this tool, it is not
          possible to affect the Duplex Group identity information
          of any UR92 or any Duplex Group other than those which
          are connected to the same wired LocoNet.</p>

      <h2><a name="Interfere" id="Interfere">Some possible
      interference sources</a></h2>

      <p>All of the available Duplex Group channel numbers specify
      frequencies in the 2.4 GHz "ISM" frequency range. Some
      electronic devices which are known to use the 2.4 GHz "ISM"
      frequency range, and thus can interfere with Duplex radio
      operation include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>2.4 GHz cordless telephones</li>

        <li>WiFi networks</li>

        <li>"Bluetooth" devices</li>

        <li>2.4 GHz wireless video cameras</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="SimplexInteract" id="SimplexInteract">Digitrax
      Simplex radio system interaction</a></h2>

      <p>It is believed that the Digitrax Simplex radio throttle
      system (UR91, DTx00R, DT402R, UT4R) has no effect on the
      Duplex Channel Scan tool, because the Simplex radio throttle
      system operates in the 915 MHz "ISM" frequency range, while
      the Duplex radio throttle system operates in the 2.4GHz "ISM"
      frequency range.</p>

      <p>Because the Simplex and Duplex radio systems use different
      radio frequency ranges, the Duplex Channel Scan tool cannot
      be used to analyze the Simplex radio frequency range. To the
      best knowledge of the tool's original author, the Simplex
      radio system does not provide any mechanisms to allow
      creation of a similar tool for analyzing Simplex radio
      interference.</p>
