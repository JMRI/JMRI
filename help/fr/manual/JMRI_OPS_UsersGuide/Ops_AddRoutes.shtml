      <p>The <strong>Add Route</strong> window opens to add a Route
      to your OperationsPro database.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute.png" alt="add route" height=
      "239" width="900"></p>Type the Route <strong>Name</strong>
      <input name="textfield" id="textfield" size="30" type="text">
      Each route must have a unique Name.

      <p>Then press <input name="button" id="button" value="Add"
      type="submit"> located at the bottom of the pane. The
      <strong>Add Route</strong> window now activates the
      attributes required to enter the Route.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute01.png" alt="add route"
      height="239" width="900"></p>

      <p>Select the Location from which the Train will depart by
      selecting the Location <select name="select" id="select">
        <option>
          North Yard
        </option>
      </select> located at the left bottom side of the window.</p>

      <p>Select <input name="radio" id="radio" value="radio"
      checked="checked" type="radio"> Add location to start
      <input name="radio2" id="radio2" value="radio2" type="radio">
      Add location at end</p>

      <p>Press <input name="button2" id="button2" value=
      "Add Location" type="submit"> An updated <strong>Add
      Route</strong> window will be displayed with all the
      attributes required active. Repeat until all stops are
      entered for the Route.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute02.png" alt="add route"
      height="239" width="900"></p>

      <p>We will now add all the Locations to the Route. Each time
      you add a Location to the Route, the table shows the order in
      which the Train will visit them. Make sure that <input name=
      "radio3" id="radio3" value="radio3" checked="checked" type=
      "radio"> <strong>Add location at end</strong> is selected to
      add after the first location.</p>

      <p>Build your Route by selecting the next Location the Train
      will visit; select all Locations that the Train will pass
      through even if the Train will not work the Location. This
      way your train's engineer will know when reading his Manifest
      the towns he will be traveling through.</p>

      <p>Make sure you press <input name="button3" id="button3"
      value="Save Route" type="submit"> when you are done entering
      the Locations.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute03.png" alt="route" height=
      "350" width="900"></p>

      <p>Each <strong>Location</strong> has the Train's departure
      direction (<strong>Train Direction</strong>), number of
      desired car <strong>Moves</strong> and whether Car
      <strong>Pickups?</strong> and/or car <strong>Drops?</strong>
      are allowed at that Location.</p>

      <p>You can also adjust the maximum Train length (<strong>Max
      Length</strong>) that can depart that Location.</p>

      <p>A Car <strong>Move</strong> can be a car Pickup or car
      Drop at that Location. For example, 5 Moves can be 5 Pickups
      or 5 Drops or any combination of 5 Pickups and Drops.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Grade</strong> is used to determine how many
      Engines the Train will require for that segment. The
      <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> are the coordinates
      on your dispatcher's Panel for the optional Train Icon. You
      can set the coordinates here, or use the "SetX&amp;Y" Train
      Icon popup menu to teach the program where you want the Train
      Icon placed when the Train is at the specified location in
      OperationsPro. Leave the X and Y coordinates at zero if you
      want to manually move the icon or you're not using the icon
      feature. After setting the number of moves, maximum length,
      or coordinates, click on the table to make sure it is
      recognized and stored by the program.</p>

      <p>You may move the selected Location <input name="button10"
      id="button10" value="Up" type="button"> or <input name=
      "button11" id="button11" value="Down" type="button"> to
      change it's position in the list.</p>

      <p>You may add a comment for each location. In the Comment
      column press <input name="button9" id="button9" value="Add"
      type="button"><br>
      <img src="images/Ops_AddRoute_comments.png" alt="comments"
      height="128" width="268"><br></p>

      <p>Press <input name="button4" id="button4" value=
      "Save Route" type="submit"> to save your route. The program
      will create a file (OperationsRouteRoster.xml) in your JMRI
      directory in a folder called "operations". A backup file with
      the last settings for all of your routes is also created each
      time <input name="button5" id="button5" value="Save Route"
      type="submit"> pressed.</p>

      <p>Now we have our first Route set up.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute04.png" alt="route" height=
      "365" width="900"></p>

      <p>You may start a new Route using the <strong>Add
      Route</strong> window and entering a new Route Name and
      repeat this process for each Route.</p>

      <p>Now back to the Route window, which will show us a list of
      all the Routes.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Routes01.png" alt="routes" height=
      "310" width="730"></p>

      <p>Note that you may press <input name="button6" id="button6"
      value="Edit" type="submit"> on any Route and the
      <strong><a href="Ops_EditRoutes.shtml">Edit
      Route</a></strong> window opens, similar to the <strong>Add
      Route</strong> window.</p>

      <p>You may now press <input name="button7" id="button7"
      value="Add" type="submit"> to add another Route, repeating
      the process just completed, or close the
      <strong>Route</strong> pane.</p>
