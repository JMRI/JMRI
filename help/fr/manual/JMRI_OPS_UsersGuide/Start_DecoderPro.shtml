      <h1>Getting Started with Operations</h1>

      <h2>OperationsPro: How to start the program</h2>

      <div align="right">
        <p><a href="Start_DCC_Hardware.shtml">Previous</a> <a href=
        "Start_Preferences.shtml">| Next</a></p>

      <p>The Operations Program is run from the DecoderPro&reg;
      Menu which is activated in the Operations Preferences.</p>

      <p>Once you have downloaded the DecoderPro&reg; software and
      installed it, simply open the program in the usual manner for
      your operating system. On MS Windows the installer will place
      an icon on your Desktop. For details please refer to the
      <a href="../../html/setup/index.shtml">JMRI Setup
      Help</a>.</p>

      <p><img src="images/DesktopIcons.png" width="223" height="79"
      alt="desktop icons"></p>

      <p>Double click on the icon for the program to open, in this
      case we will open DecoderPro&reg;.</p>

      <p>The following dialog will appear briefly as the program is
      loading:</p>

      <p><img src="images/StartDialog.png" width="170" height="167"
      alt="Start dialog"></p>

      <p>You should see this or a similar opening screen displayed
      after one of the JMRI&reg; programs starts:</p>

      <h1><img src="images/Splash_Screen.png" width="496" height=
      "282" alt="splash"></h1>

      <p>It may take a while for this screen to come up, especially
      on older and slower computers. Remember that you are
      essentially running the program on a Java emulator over your
      native operating system software. New computers can do this
      fairly quickly, but older ones will feel like they're taking
      forever. <strong>Be patient</strong> - it will come up
      eventually! Even on older computers, once the program is up
      the response time is quite good.</p>

      <p>If this is the first time you have run the program after
      you installed the software, the <a href=
      "Start_Preferences.shtml">Preferences</a> screen will come up
      automatically to allow you to set up the system for your
      particular configuration. Also if you change your system
      configuration, OR if you have your laptop away from the
      railroad, but you want to play with JMRI there is a simulator
      mode you may want to try. So click next, and we"ll have a
      look at Preferences.</p>
