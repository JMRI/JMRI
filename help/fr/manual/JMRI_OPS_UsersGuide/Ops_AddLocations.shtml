      The <strong>Add Location</strong> window is opened from the
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Locations</span> window
      using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span> button
      at the bottom of the window. Initially only the <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">Name</span> and the <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">Operations (Tracks) at this
      location</span> parts are active.

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src=
      "images/Ops_AddLocation.png" alt="add location" height="589"
      width="772"></p>

      <p><strong>Name</strong> <input name="textfield" id=
      "textfield" type="text"> The Location name must be unique;
      OperationsPro will not allow two Locations with identical
      names. However, if you want more than one Location to have
      the same name on your Manifests and Switch Lists, add a
      hyphen and a number to the end of the Locations name. For
      example, <strong>Boston-1</strong> and
      <strong>Boston-2</strong> will both print as
      <strong>Boston</strong>. The program will remove the hyphen
      and number when printing Manifests and Switch Lists.</p>Press
      <input name="button2" id="button2" value="Add Location" type=
      "submit"> at the bottom of the panel. The various fields that
      were disabled should now be enabled.

      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src=
      "images/Ops_AddLocation01.png" alt="Add Location" height=
      "585" width="772"></p>

      <p>Each Location can have several Yard, Spur, Interchange or
      Staging Tracks:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Yards are where Cars and Engines are placed for
        temporary storage.</li>

        <li>A Spur can be an industry or any place where a Car is
        loaded or unloaded.</li>
      </ul>For a Train to service a Location, there must be at
      least one Track for that Location. See <a href=
      "#addtracks">below</a> how to add Tracks to your Location.

      <p><strong>Select the rolling stock serviced by this
      Location</strong></p>

      <p>The Locations Table shows the total length of all Tracks,
      the amount of track that is occupied (Used) by Cars and
      Engines, the total number of Cars and Engines (Rolling Stock)
      at each Location, the number of Cars and Engines that will be
      picked up (Pickups) by Trains, and the number of Cars and
      Engines that will be delivered (Drops) here by active
      Trains.</p>

      <p><strong>This Location is serviced by trains
      traveling</strong> <strong><input name="checkbox" id=
      "checkbox" type="checkbox"> North <input name="checkbox2" id=
      "checkbox2" checked="checked" type="checkbox"> South
      <input name="checkbox3" id="checkbox3" type="checkbox"> East
      <input name="checkbox4" id="checkbox4" type="checkbox">
      West<br></strong> You can decide which train direction the
      Location can service. For example, if only south bound trains
      can access the Location, select <strong>South</strong> and
      deselect the other directions. This can be useful if you want
      to only support trailing point switching for a given
      Location. If a Location can support multiple directions then
      select the ones that are appropriate.<br>

      To add a Track, press the "Add [...] Track" button. Now enter
      the name of the Track along with the length of the Track in
      scale feet or in actual inches. Append a double quote (") to
      the length when entering actual inches to have OperationsPro
      convert the length into scale feet. Append cm if you want to
      convert from centimeters to meters. Press the "Add [...]
      Track" button at the bottom of the panel to add a new track
      to the list and activate the disabled fields.</p>

      <p>The <input name="button3" id="button3" value=
      "Add [...] Track" type="submit"> button at the bottom of the
      window will change to match the option you chose as "Tracks
      at this Location".<br></p>

      Classification/Interchange, or Staging Only (corresponding to
      the present task)</a></h4>

      <p>To add a Location, press the "Add [location]" button,
      which shows one of the following types</p>

      <p><a href="Ops_AddSiding.shtml"><input name="button4" id=
      "button4" value="Add Spur Track" type="button"></a> <a href=
      "Ops_AddSiding.shtml">Add Spur Track</a></p>

      "button7" value="Add Staging Only Track" type="button"></a>
      <a href="Ops_AddStaging.shtml">Add Staging Only Track</a></p>

      <p>Each of these buttons opens a corresponding dialog to
      describe its function.</p>

      <h4>Save [...] Track</h4>

      <p>Press the <input name="button8" id="button8" value=
      "Save Location" type="submit"> to save your work. The program
      will create a file (OperationsLocationRoster.xml) in your
      JMRI directory in a folder called "operations". The program
      will also create a backup file containing the last settings
      for all of your locations. <a name="Sidings" id=
      "Sidings"></a></p>

      <p>Spurs are very similar to <a href=
      "Ops_AddYard.shtml">Yards</a>, so see above for more
      information. You can if you wish schedule the order that Cars
      will be delivered to a Spur. See <a href=
      "Ops_schedule.shtml">Schedules</a> for more information.</p>
