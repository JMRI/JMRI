# FollowJumpingPanel is a diagnostic tool that can provide panel location meterics

# While testing this script, the data has show x=-10 and y=-10 even though the panel appears to
# be where expected, until some correction is invoked???

    Normal usage of this script should not require the DEBUG log messages, HOWEVER:

    If you wish to enable the DEBUG log messages, COPY the following TWO LINES:
log4j.category.jmri.jmrit.jython.exec=DEBUG

# ###########  Copy the two lines above this one  ############# #
    into the file named "default.lcf" found in your JMRI Programs folder or into the copy that you have placed in your settings directory. Place those copied lines near or at the END of the file.  But, be certain that the last line of that file is an empty string! 

            IMPORTANT FURTHER INFORMATION: 
    EFFECTIVE with JMRI Version 4.6, the following change is described in the Release Notes: 
        'Logging Preferences in a file named "default.lcf" in the settings directory take precedence over logging preferences that ship with JMRI. The "default.lcf" can be copied from the JMRI installation as a starting point.'

# Execution is staged on enabling evidence of the completion of three Start Up 
# events and is NOT based on clock interval estimations for some hypothetical 
# configuration. 
#
# The pieces of enabling evidence are listed here, in time order of appearance:
#        1.    The list of JmriJFrame windows is not empty. 
#        2.    An entry on that list has a Main JMRI Window name that we recognize. 
#        3.    That identified Main JMRI Window must be visible. 
#
#   AND:   Each piece of evidence is obtained by simplistic "repeated polling" rather 
#            than by the use of more sophisticated "listener" features of 
#            Java and/or Jython. 
#
# Using the Preferences dialog Window with the Start Up tab and the list of 
# "Items will be executed or opened in the order listed," is the expected normal 
# way to execute ANY script.  Observe the note at the bottom of that tab suggesting 
# that "Scripts should be run last in most cases."  
#
'''
However, for this script to provide useful metrics, it should be executed before loading a panel file that has a Layout Editor panel that is suspected of jumping.
'''
#
# This script waits for evidence provided by events that are known to occur late in the 
# Start Up process.  This script works best if it is executed LAST in the Start Up process! 
#
# The Main JMRI Window doesn't become visible until  VERY LATE  in the Start Up process. 
#
# Manually executing this script from within a running App does not pose the need 
# for the programmed delays.  The logic used here will quickly fall through the 
# checkpoints to provide an __almost__ immediate result.
