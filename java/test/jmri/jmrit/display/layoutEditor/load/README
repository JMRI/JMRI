This directory contains submitted "real" panel files
for testing. The SchemaTest class ensures that they
pass full schema validation.  (Files submitted a while
ago are sometimes loaded and resaved, or directly edited,
to get the most recent content form)

Note that these files are also references in the Cucumber tests via the
     java/acceptancetest/features/web/WebPanel.feature
test definition file.

Note that other files, used for schema validation without load/store,
are found in ../valid and ../invalid
