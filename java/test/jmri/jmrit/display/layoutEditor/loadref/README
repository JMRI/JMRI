This directory contains comparison files
for load/store testing. They are named the
same as the corresponding file in the 
"load" directory.

In general, the .xml files tagged with older version numbers 
have been run through the most recent version so they 
compare OK.  For example, load/Decorations-4-19-4.xml is
a 4.19.4 format file that we want to be sure to be able to read.
loadref/Decorations-4-19-4.xml (here) is the expected
output from running that through the most recent version
of the code. This means that these .xml files are 
updated as the code changes. Note that, because various substitutions can 
be made to simplify testing, these may not 
be schema-valid.

The .png files are meant to be invarient examples of the display 
from older versions.  Unlike the .xml files, we do not expect
much change in the display from old panel files (users don't like that).
So we keep these around for comparison with the contents of temp/temp after running

./runtest.csh java/test/jmri/jmrit/display/layoutEditor/LoadAndStoreTest
