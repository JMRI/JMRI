This directory contains comparison files
for load/store testing. They are named the
same as the corresponding file in the 
"load" directory.

Note that, because various substitutions can 
be made to simplify testing, these may not 
be schema-valid.


The .png files here are for comparison with the contents of temp/temp after running

./runtest.csh java/test/jmri/jmrit/display/layoutEditor/LoadAndStoreTest

These files were made on macOS Mojave from master on May 1, 2020.  Other setups
may differ, so we're not automating these tests (yet)
