/**
 * Application for running JMRI server functions without a graphical interface.
 * Goal is to run on very light hardware, such as a Raspberry Pi, without
 * requiring the overhead associated with display functions. Needs an existing
 * JMRI configuration file passed as parm to program, or it will use the default
 * of JmriFacelessConfig3.xml Copied from apps.gui3.demo3.Demo3, then removed
 * all ui-related elements NOTE: JMRI "server" functions based on ui components
 * (such as JmriJFrames) may need to be modified to check isHeadless() and
 * adjust their behavior as needed.
