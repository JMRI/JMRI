        The JmriDemo JMRI application.

        <P>
            The JmriDemo application is intended to demonstrate the
            capabilities of the JMRI libraries.  It therefore contains
            all of the tools, including a complete set of system-specific
            tools.  (That also allows us to use it for testing and 
            debugging).
            Other applications, such as DecoderPro and LocoTools,
            have a more coherent appearance because they are focused on
            a particular use.
        <P>
            The main routine for the JmriDemo application
            is in the {@link apps.JmriDemo.JMRIdemo} class, which 
            extensively uses support from the 
            {@link apps} package.
