        The gui3 package provides basic function for JMRI applications
        that use the new "Gui3" user interface first seen in the 
        updated DecoderPro (formerly known as DecoderPro3).

        <h2>Related Documentation</h2>

        This package works in concert with the 
        {@link jmri.util.swing} package, which contains
        the Swing-related implementation classes.
        <p>
        The overall capability is discussed on the
        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Swing.shtml">Swing support</a> page in the 
        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/index.shtml">JMRI Developers pages</a>.
