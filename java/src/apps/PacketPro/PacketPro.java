/**
 * Main program for the PacketProprogram based on JMRI.
 * <P>
 * PacketPro is a tool for sending NMRA DCC packets, intended to make testing of
 * DCC components easier. It's similar in intent to the NMRA PacketScript
 * program, though it uses a different scripting language.
 * <P>
 * If an argument is provided at startup, it will be used as the name of the
 * configuration file. Note that this is just the name, not the path; the file
 * is searched for in the usual way, first in the preferences tree and then in
 * xml/
