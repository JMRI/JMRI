 * <P>
 * The states and names are Java Bean parameters, so that listeners can be

 * <P>
 * Each Audio object has a two names. The "user" name is entirely free form, and
 * can be used for any purpose. The "system" name is provided by the
 * system-specific implementations, and provides a unique mapping to the layout
 * control system and address within that system.
