/**
 * Locate a Turnout object representing some specific turnout on the layout.
 * <P>
 * Turnout objects are obtained from a TurnoutManager, which in turn is
 * generally located from the InstanceManager. A typical call sequence might be:
 * <PRE>
 * Turnout turnout = InstanceManager.turnoutManagerInstance().provideTurnout("23");
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * Each turnout has a two names. The "user" name is entirely free form, and can
 * be used for any purpose. The "system" name is provided by the system-specific
 * implementations, and provides a unique mapping to the layout control system
 * (for example LocoNet or NCE) and address within that system.
 * <P>
 * Much of the book-keeping is implemented in the AbstractTurnoutManager class,
 * which can form the basis for a system-specific implementation.
 * <P>
 * A sample use of the TurnoutManager interface can be seen in the
 * jmri.jmrit.simpleturnoutctrl.SimpleTurnoutCtrlFrame class, which provides a
 * simple GUI for controlling a single turnout.
