        Provides an XML-based mechanism for storing and restoring configurations.

        <P>
            This is intended to satisfy a number of requirements:
        <UL>
            <LI>No XML-specific code in the objects being loaded/stored.
            <LI>Separation at the package level between load/store code and the configured objects
            <LI>Customizable storage of complex objects
            <LI>Control over the order in which complex objects are recreated during load.
        </UL>

        <P>

            To do this:
        <OL>
            <LI>The application registers relevant objects with the
                ConfigXmlManager class.  These objects are usually the higher-level
                managers; since code has to be written for the actual class
                of these objects, you should design to have a minimal
                number of them.  For example, a LayoutManager object of the
                specific LocoNetLayoutManager class might be registered.
            <LI>The ConfigXmlManager checks that an adapter class
                for that object exists.  The adapter class for an object
                of package and class "p.c" is located at
                runtime by searching for a class called "p.configurexml.cXml",
                and must implement jmri.configurexml.Adapter.
            <LI>When a store operation is required, the ConfigXmlManager
                object iterates over the set of registered objects.  For each,
                it creates an adapter object and requests a store operation, which
                returns a JDOM Element which is added to the output XML.
            <LI>When a load operation is required, the input XML file
                is iterated through.  For each top-level Element, an adapter
                object of the described type is created and passed the Element.
                Note that the adapter should register the objects it creates!
        </ol>

        <P>
            We choose to put the adapters in a separate package to
            encourage the reduction of coupling, and make it clear that
            they are separate (you can get a source tree without them
            easily, for example).  But this means
            that package-level member variables are not automatically
            visible.  For one class, you can get around this by subclassing.
            We'll have to see whether this is a real problem or not.

        <P>
            On read, the right class has to be found to
            handle any given top-level XML element.  We do this
            in an ugly fashion by putting the class name in the
            "class" attribute. This prevents the XML output from
            being portable from program to program, an unfortunate
            loss, but for the time being it seems a reasonable compromise.

        <P>
            The various types do still have descriptive element names (e.g. "turnouts")
            to help the reader and 
            so that we can have an understandable schema.

        <P>The order of loading is the order in the XML file, as written.
            This constrains the write order: It has to make sure that the reading
            process works, in that objects are created before others need to reference 
            them.
        <P>
            There are four levels of information, a coarse measure to ensure
            that prerequisites are present during a load:
        <UL>
            <LI>Pref
            <LI>Config
            <LI>Tool
            <LI>User
        </UL>
        
        <P>
            Additionally, the {@link jmri.manager} class has a 
            {@link jmri.manager#getXMLOrder} method that 
            is used to order operations within a level.

        <a id="schema"></a>
        <h2>Schema management</h2>

        Validation is via XML Schema. (Use of DTDs ended in the 2.9 development series.)

        <p>
            Schemas for these files are found in the
            <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/schema/">xml/schema</a>
            directory.
        <p>
            A rudimentary version control system is provided by schema file naming, i.e.
        <ul>
            <li>layout-config.xsd - the original, not to be changed any more.
            <li>layout-config-2-9-6.xsd - manually created when the first non-backward-compatible XML content 
                change was made after the release of JMRI 2.9.3, this accumulates changes
                until some later non-backward-compatible change is made.
        </ul>

        When a non-backward compatible change is made to XML persistance,
        the following steps are needed:
        <ul>
            <li>Copy the existing schema to one with the next version name (e.g.
                while building the 2.7.4 release, 
                copy layout-config-2-7-4.xsd to layout-config-2-7-5.xsd)
                and commit to SVN.
            <li>Update the comment on the previous file.
            <li>Update the references in the 
                {@link jmri.configurexml.ConfigXmlManager} code.
        </ul>
