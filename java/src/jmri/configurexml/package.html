Provides an XML-based mechanism for storing and restoring configurations.

<P>
This is intended to satisfy a number of requirements:
<UL>
<LI>No XML-specific code in the objects being loaded/stored.
<LI>Separation at the package level between load/store code and the configured objects
<LI>Customizable storage of complex objects
<LI>Control over the order in which complex objects are recreated during load.
</UL>

<P>

To do this:
<OL>
<LI>The application registers relevant objects with the
ConfigXmlManager class.  These objects are usually the higher-level
managers; since code has to be written for the actual class
of these objects, you should design to have a minimal
number of them.  For example, a LayoutManager object of the
specific LocoNetLayoutManager class might be registered.
<LI>The ConfigXmlManager checks that an adapter class
for that object exists.  The adapter class for an object
of package and class "p.c" is located at
runtime by searching for a class called "p.configurexml.cXml",
and must implement jmri.configurexml.Adapter.
<LI>When a store operation is required, the ConfigXmlManager
object iterates over the set of registered objects.  For each,
it creates an adapter object and requests a store operation, which
returns a JDOM Element which is added to the output XML.
<LI>When a load operation is required, the input XML file
is iterated through.  For each top-level Element, an adapter
object of the described type is created and passed the Element.
Note that the adapter should register the objects it creates!
</ol>

<P>
We choose to put the adapters in a separate package to
encourage the reduction of coupling, and make it clear that
they are separate (you can get a source tree without them
from CVS easily, for example).  But this means
that package-level member variables are not automatically
visible.  For one class, you can get around this by subclassing.
We'll have to see whether this is a real problem or not.

<P>
On read, the right class has to be found to
handle any given top-level XML element.  We do this
in an ugly fashion by putting the class name in the
"class" attribute. This prevents the XML output from
being portable from program to program, an unfortunate
loss, but for the time being it seems a reasonable compromise.

<P>
The various types do still have element names (e.g. "turnouts")
so that we can have a rational DTD.

<P>The order of loading is the order in the XML file, as written.
The write order is the registration order.  This constrains
how certain registrations at startup are done.
In particular, the layout tree has a problem:  It seems it should be
instantiated before the turnout managers, etc, so that it can
listen as their contents are added.  But if it's created first, it
has no turnout manager instance to connect to yet.  The solution to
this seems to be support for an "InstanceListener" in the InstanceManager so
that objects can learn about the creation of new basic instances.

<P>
There are four levels of information, used to ensure
that prerequisites are present during a load:
<UL>
<LI>Pref
<LI>Config
<LI>Tool
<LI>User
</UL>

<h2>DTD management</h2>

During the JMRI 2.9.* development series, we are moving to XML Schema
for content definition, and away from DTDs.  This section
remains while that migration takes place, and if you have to
deal with a problem in an older file.

<p>
DTDs for these files are found in the
<a href="http://jmri.org/xml/DTD/">xml/DTD</a>
directory.
<p>
A rudimentary version control system is provided by DTD naming, i.e.
<ul>
<li>layout-config.dtd - the original, not to be changed any more.
<li>layout-config-2-7-5.dtd - manually created when the first XML content 
change was made after the release of JMRI 2.7.4, this accumulates changes
until 2.7.5 is released.
</ul>

The first time a change is made to XML persistance after a release,
the following steps are needed:
<ul>
<li>Copy the existing DTD to one with the next version name (e.g.
while building the 2.7.4 release, 
copy layout-config-2-7-4.dtd to layout-config-2-7-5.dtd)
and commit to CVS.
<li>Update the comment on the previous file.
<li>Update the references in the 
{@link jmri.configurexml.ConfigXmlManager} code.
</ul>
