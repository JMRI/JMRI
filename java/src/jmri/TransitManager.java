/**
 * Implementation of a Transit Manager
 * <p>
 * This doesn't need an interface, since Transits are globaly implemented,
 * instead of being system-specific.
 * <p>
 * Note that Transit system names must begin with system prefix and type character,
 * usually IZ, and be followed by a string, usually, but not always, a number. This
 * is enforced when a Transit is created.
