/**
 * Signal Groups are used to represent European subsidary signals that would
 * be sited with a signal mast. Such subsidary signals would be used to
 * indicated routes, junctions and allowable speeds. Each such
 * route/junction/speed would be represented by a single output signal (head),
 * that is either Off or On. Within the group only one such signal head would be
 * allowed on at any one time.
 * <P>
 * The group is attached to a main signal mast, and can be configured to be
 * activated depending upon one or more aspects when displayed on that signal
 * mast.
 * <P>
 * Each signal head within the group is defined with an On and Off appearance,
 * and a set of criteria in the form of matching turnouts and sensor states,
 * that must be met for the head to be set On.
 * <P>
 * For code clarity, JMRI uses the terms (signal)Mast and (signal)Head instead
 * of Signal. Masts show Aspects, Heads show Appearances, though outside the USA
 * this will vary. Use localization to address this in the user interface.
