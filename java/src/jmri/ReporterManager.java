/**
 * Locate a Reporter object representing some specific device on the layout.
 * <P>
 * Reporter objects are obtained from a ReporterManager, which in turn is
 * generally located from the InstanceManager. A typical call sequence might be:
 * <PRE>
 * Reporter device = InstanceManager.reporterManagerInstance().newReporter(null,"23");
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * Each Reporter has a two names. The "user" name is entirely free form, and can
 * be used for any purpose. The "system" name is provided by the system-specific
 * implementations, and provides a unique mapping to the layout control system
 * (e.g. LocoNet, NCE, etc) and address within that system.
 * <P>
 * Much of the book-keeping is implemented in the AbstractReporterManager class,
 * which can form the basis for a system-specific implementation.
