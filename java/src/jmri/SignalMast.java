/**
 * Represent a signal mast. A signal mast is one or more signal heads that are
 * treated as a single signal. (Imagine several heads attached to a single mast,
 * though other implementations are possible)
 * <P>
 * A mast presents an Aspect, as that's a composite of the appearance(s) of the
 * entire signal.
 * <P>
 * This class has three bound parameters:
 * <DL>
 * <DT>Aspect<DD>The specific aspect being shown.
 * <p>
 * Aspects are named by a user defined String name.
 * <DT>Lit<DD>Whether the mast's lamps are lit or left dark.
 * This differs from the DARK color defined for the appearance parameter, in
 * that it's independent of that. Lit is intended to allow you to extinquish a
 * signal mast for approach lighting, while still allowing it's color to be set
 * to a definite value for e.g. display on a panel or evaluation in higher level
 * logic.
 * <DT>Held<DD>Whether the mast's lamps should be forced to a specific aspect,
 * e.g. Stop, in higher-level logic.
 * <P>
 * For use in signaling systems, this is a convenient way of storing whether a
 * higher-level of control (e.g. non-vital system or dispatcher) has "held" the
 * signal at stop. It does not effect how this signal mast actually works; any
 * appearance can be set and will be displayed even when "held" is set.
 * </dl>
 * The integer state (getState(), setState()) is the index of the current aspect
 * in the list of all defined aspects.
