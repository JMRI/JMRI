 * Interface for an object that can arrange for a {@link JmriPanel} to be

 * <p>
 * Typically used by some component that wants to display a pane (for example,
 * in an independent JmriJFrame or as part of a paned interface) to do some more
 * stuff. Rather than have the component build it's own window, etc it invokes
 * one of these, so that the position and display of that component can be
 * controlled.
 * <p>
 * Any {@link JmriAbstractAction} that uses the show() method will have its
 * dispose() invoked when the associated frame goes away. It should dispose()
 * any cached panes at that time.
