        Tools and utilities for providing a multi-document interface 
        for a JMRI application.  
        This style is sometimes called an "MDI" interface,
        where there's a primary window that contains movable 
        sub-windows with various information.

        <p>
            This whole package might be moved to the apps tree at some later point.
