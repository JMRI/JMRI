/**
 * Represent a single signal head. (Try saying that ten times fast!) A signal
 * may have more than one of these (e.g. a signal mast consisting of several
 * heads) when needed to represent more complex aspects, e.g. Diverging Approach
 * etc.
 * <p>
 * This allows access to explicit appearance information. We don't call this an
 * Aspect, as that's a composite of the appearance of several heads.
 * <p>
 * This class has three bound parameters:
 * <DL>
 * <DT>Appearance<DD>The specific color being shown. Values are the various
 * color constants defined in the class.
 * <p>
 * The appearance constants form a bit mask, so they can be used with hardware
 * that can display e.g. more than one lit color at a time. Individual
 * implementations may not be able to handle that, however; most of the early
 * ones probably won't. If a particular implementation can't display a commanded
 * color, it doesn't try to replace it, but rather just leaves that color off
 * the resulting display.
 * <DT>Lit<DD>Whether the head's lamps are lit or left dark.
 * <p>
 * This differs from the DARK color defined for the appearance parameter, in
 * that it's independent of that. Lit is intended to allow you to extinguish a
 * signal head for approach lighting, while still allowing it's color to be set
 * to a definite value for e.g. display on a panel or evaluation in higher level
 * logic.
 *
 * <DT>Held<DD>Whether the head's lamps should be forced to a specific
 * appearance, e.g. RED in higher-level logic.
 * <p>
 * For use in signaling systems, this is a convenient way of storing whether a
 * higher-level of control (e.g. non-vital system or dispatcher) has "held" the
 * signal at stop. It does not effect how this signal head actually works; any
 * appearance can be set and will be displayed even when "held" is set.
