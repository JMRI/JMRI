/**
 * Routes represent a collection of Turnouts that may be set at the same time.
 * <P>
 * When a user adds a Turnout to a Route, the user specifies whether the Turnout
 * state is to be set to CLOSED or THROWN when the Route is invoked (set).
 * <P>
 * Initially, Routes will have a fixed maximum number of sensors for simplicity
 * of implementation. We can revise this later to use Java Collections if this
 * becomes a problem.
 * <P>
 * To allow control via fascia panel pushbuttons, Routes may optionally be
 * invoked by one or more Sensors (up to the maximum allowed).
 * <p>
 * A route can be enabled or not. By default it is enabled, and will act when
 * it's specified input conditions become satisfied. When not enabled (the
 * enabled parameter is false), the route will not act even if the specified
 * input conditions are satisfied. When the route transitions from disabled to
 * enabled, it may act, depending on the conditions: Edge triggered conditions
 * will not be satisfied, but level-conditions may be.
