/**
 * Provide controls for layout power.
 * <P>
 * The PowerManager handles two states:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>On/Off which controls electrical power to the track
 * <LI>Started/Stopped which controls the sending of packets to the layout
 * </UL>
 * A layout may not have control over these, in which case attempts to change
 * them should return an exception. If the state cannot be sensed, that should
 * also return an exception.
