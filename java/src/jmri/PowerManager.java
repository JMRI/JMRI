/**
 * Provide controls for layout power.
 * <P>
 * The PowerManager handles three states:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>On/Off which controls electrical power to the track
 * <LI>an optional "Idle" state, where track power is alive but track-connected
 *     decoders may be un-controllable
 * </UL>
 * A layout may not have control over these, in which case attempts to change
 * them should return an exception. If the state cannot be sensed, that should
 * also return an exception.
 * <p>
 * Some connections, including some LocoNet-based connections, implement the "Idle"
 * state.  For these LocoNet-based connections, when the Power state is "Idle", the
 * track power is alive and the command station is broadcasting "stop" to all mobile
 * decoders. Other systems may implement different interpretation of the "Idle" state.
