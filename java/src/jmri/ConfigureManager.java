/**
 * Provide load/store capabilities for general configuration.
 * <P>
 * Areas of responsibility:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Register and deregister configuration objects so they can eventually be
 * stored.
 * <LI>Invoke the load and store operations as needed
 * <LI>Give access to the configuration objects for independent GUIs
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * The managed items are divided into four types:
 * <OL>
 * <LI>"Prefs" - handled first on read, these are the general preferences
 * controlling how the program starts up
 * <LI>"Config" - layout configuration information, e.g. turnout, signal, etc
 * <LI>"Tool" - (Not really clear yet, but present)
 * <LI>"User" - typically information about panels and windows, these are
 * handled last during startup
 * </OL>
 * <P>
 * The configuration manager is generally located through the InstanceManager.
 * <P>
 * The original implementation was via the {@link jmri.configurexml} package.
