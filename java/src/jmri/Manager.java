/**
 * Basic interface for access to named, managed objects.
 * <P>
 * {@link NamedBean} objects represent various real elements, and have a "system
 * name" and perhaps "user name". A specific Manager object provides access to
 * them by name, and serves as a factory for new objects.
 * <P>
 * Right now, this interface just contains the members needed by
 * {@link InstanceManager} to handle managers for more than one system.
 * <P>
 * Although they are not defined here because their return type differs, any
 * specific Manager subclass provides "get" methods to locate specific objects,
 * and a "new" method to create a new one via the Factory pattern. The "get"
 * methods will return an existing object or null, and will never create a new
 * object. The "new" method will log a warning if an object already exists with
 * that system name.
 * <P>
 * add/remove PropertyChangeListener methods are provided. At a minimum,
 * subclasses must notify of changes to the list of available NamedBeans; they
 * may have other properties that will also notify.
