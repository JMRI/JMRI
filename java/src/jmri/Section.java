/**
 * Sections represent a group of one or more connected Blocks that may be
 * allocated to a train traveling in a given direction.
 * <p>
 * A Block may be in multiple Sections. All Blocks contained in a given section
 * must be unique. Blocks are kept in order--the first block is connected to the
 * second, the second is connected to the third, etc.
 * <p>
 * A Block in a Section must be connected to the Block before it (if there is
 * one) and to the Block after it (if there is one), but may not be connected to
 * any other Block in the Section. This restriction is enforced when a Section
 * is created, and checked when a Section is loaded from disk.
 * <p>
 * A Section has a "direction" defined by the sequence in which Blocks are added
 * to the Section. A train may run through a Section in either the forward
 * direction (from first block to last block) or reverse direction (from last
 * block to first block).
 * <p>
 * A Section has one or more EntryPoints. Each EntryPoint is a Path of one of
 * the Blocks in the Section that defines a connection to a Block outside of the
 * Section. EntryPoints are grouped into two lists: "forwardEntryPoints" - entry
 * through which will result in a train traveling in the "forward" direction
 * "reverseEntryPoints" - entry through which will result in a train traveling
 * in the "reverse" direction Note that "forwardEntryPoints" are also reverse
 * exit points, and vice versa.
 * <p>
 * A Section has one of the following states" FREE - available for allocation by
 * a dispatcher FORWARD - allocated for travel in the forward direction REVERSE
 * - allocated for travel in the reverse direction
 * <p>
 * A Section has an occupancy. A Section is OCCUPIED if any of its Blocks is
 * OCCUPIED. A Section is UNOCCUPIED if all of its Blocks are UNOCCUPIED
 * <p>
 * A Section of may be allocated to only one train at a time, even if the trains
 * are travelling in the same direction. If a Section has sufficient space for
 * multiple trains travelling in the same direction it should be broken up into
 * multiple Sections so the trains can follow each other through the original
 * Section.
 * <p>
 * A Section may not contain any reverse loops. The track that is reversed in a
 * reverse loop must be in a separate Section.
 * <p>
 * Each Section optionally carries two direction sensors, one for the forward
 * direction and one for the reverse direction. These sensors force signals for
 * travel in their respective directions to "RED" when they are active. When the
 * Section is free, both the sensors are Active. These internal sensors follow
 * the state of the Section, permitting signals to function normally in the
 * direction of allocation.
 * <p>
 * Each Section optionally carries two stopping sensors, one for the forward
 * direction and one for the reverse direction. These sensors change to active
 * when a train traversing the Section triggers its sensing device. Stopping
 * sensors are physical layout sensors, and may be either point sensors or
 * occupancy sensors for short blocks at the end of the Section. A stopping
 * sensor is used during automatic running to stop a train that has reached the
 * end of its allocated Section. This is needed, for example, to allow a train
 * to enter a passing siding and clear the track behind it. When not running
 * automatically, these sensors may be used to light panel lights to notify the
 * dispatcher that the train has reached the end of the Section.
 * <p>
 * This Section implementation provides for delayed initialization of blocks and
 * direction sensors to be independent of order of items in panel files.
