/**
 * A Logix is a group of Conditionals that monitor one or more conditions
 * (internal or on the layout). It services these Conditionals by installing and
 * deinstalling the proper listeners for their variables.
 * <P>
 * A Logix can be enabled or not. It passes this attribute to its Conditionals.
 * By default it is enabled. When not enabled, a Conditional will still respond
 * to callbacks from its listeners and calculate its state, however it will not
 * execute its actions. Enabled is a bound property of a Logix.
 * <P>
 * A Logix can be deactivated or not. When deactivated, the listeners of the
 * Conditional variables are deinstalled.
 * <P>
 * A Logix does not have a "state", however, each of its Conditionals does.
