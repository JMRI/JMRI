/**
 * Locate a Memory object representing some specific information.
 * <P>
 * Memory objects are obtained from a MemoryManager, which in turn is generally
 * located from the InstanceManager. A typical call sequence might be:
 * <PRE>
 * Memory memory = InstanceManager.memoryManagerInstance().provideMemory("status");
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * Each Memory has a two names. The "user" name is entirely free form, and can
 * be used for any purpose. The "system" name is provided by the system-specific
 * implementations, if any, and provides a unique mapping to the layout control
 * system (for example LocoNet or NCE) and address within that system. Note that
 * most (all?) layout systems don't have anything corresponding to this, in
 * which case the "Internal" Memory objects are still available with names like
 * IM23.
 * <P>
 * Much of the book-keeping is implemented in the AbstractMemoryManager class,
 * which can form the basis for a system-specific implementation.
