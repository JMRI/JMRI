/**
 * An AudioFactory is responsible for the initialisation of specific audio

 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * Each factory varies in its capabilities with regard the faithfulness of the
 * audio rendering model (such as spatial positioning approximation), number of
 * concurrent sounds (polyphony), hardware required, etc.
 * <p>
 * Current implemented audio systems include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>JOAL
 * <li>JavaSound
 * <li>Null (a catch-all which doesn't actually play any sounds)
 * </ul>
