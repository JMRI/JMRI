PortalNameConflict = Portal "{0}" cannot be changed since it is in use\nby Paths and Blocks. Use [Delete] and add new Portal.
PortalNeedsBlock = Portal "{0}" needs to have a Block specified on each side.
SametoFromBlock = Portal cannot have Block "{0}"\non both sides. (i.e. portal goes nowhere.)
DelayTriggerTime = Shift the speed change point to occur sooner(+) or later(-). {0} is an unreasonable value.

BadNumber       = {0} is not a number.
