 * Support for implementing USS CTC systems in JMRI.

 *     There are a number of older tools remaining in this package:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>Follower - connects a Turnout to the state of a Sensor. Useful for 
 *         e.g. driving a turnout from a switch on the fascia, or to 
 *         drive an indicator light on a physical panel from a senor. 
 *         A veto sensor is optionally available, e.g. to prevent a turnout from
 *         being changed under a train.
 *     <LI>OS Indicator - drives the lamp on the panel for a particular OS.
 *         Honors a separate lock/unlocked indication by showing occupied if the
 *         associated turnout has been unlocked.
 * </UL>
 * 
 * <P>
 *     Each tool is made of three parts:
 * <OL>
 *     <LI>A class that handles creation and editing of the underlying objects
 *         that implement the tool.  For example, the
 *         OsIndicator
 *         class provides objects that can create the Routes and Logix needed
 *         to implement an OS Indicator.
 *     <LI>A class to provide a JPanel for creating and editing the objects.
 *         For example, the OsIndicatorPanel class does this for OsIndicators.
 *     <LI>A class to provide a default frame for embedding the panel. In
 *         the case of Os Indicators, this is OsIndicatorFrame. These are children of 
 *         JmriJFrames so they can inherit the features expected ot a JMRI tool frame.
 *     <LI>A class to provide an Action that will open the frame, e.g. for use in menus.
 * </OL>
 * 
 * <p>
 *     The underlying implementations for these are based on
 *     Logix and Routes, not on specific classes.
