class OPath
note right: An OPath is a route that traverses a Block\nfrom one boundary to another.

class OBlock
note right: OBlock extends jmri.Block to be used in\nLogix Conditionals and Warrants. It is\nthe smallest piece of track that can have\noccupancy detection. A better name would\nbe Detection Circuit. However, an OBlock\ncan be defined without an occupancy\nsensor and used to calculate routes.

class Portal
note right: A Portal is a boundary between two Blocks
