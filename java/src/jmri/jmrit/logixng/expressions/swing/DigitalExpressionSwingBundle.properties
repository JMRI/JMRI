Important note about Antecedent.                                                                \
<p>&nbsp;<p>                                                                                    \
This expression is included for backward compability with Logix. For that reason, Antecedent    \
uses R1, R2, R3, and so on, in its expression. R1 is the first child expression. R2 is the      \
second child expression. R3 is the third child expression. And so on. The children may have     \
whatever name you want.                                                                         \
<p>&nbsp;<p>                                                                                    \
R stands for Row, which makes sense in Conditional but not so much here. But Antecedent is      \
included for backward compability.                                                              \
<p>&nbsp;<p>                                                                                    \
It's recommended to use Formula instead of Antecedent. Formula is much more powerful than       \
Antecedent. And Formula uses the name of the children in the formula, instead of R1, R2, ...    \
