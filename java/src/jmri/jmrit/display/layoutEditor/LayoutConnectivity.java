/**
 * A LayoutConnectivity object represents a junction between two LayoutBlocks on
 * a LayoutEditor panel.
 * <P>
 * LayoutConnectivity objects do not persist (are not saved when panels are
 * saved). Instead they are initialized when a panel is loaded and changed
 * dynamically as a panel is edited.
 * <P>
 * The direction stored here is the direction for proceeding across the block
 * boundary from block1 to block2. The directions represent directions on the
 * LayoutEditor panel. Allowed values (using Path object definitions) are:
 * Path.NORTH (up on panel) Path.SOUTH (down on panel) Path.EAST (right on
 * panel) Path.WEST (left on panel) and points in between: Path.NORTH +
 * Path.EAST Path.NORTH + Path.WEST Path.SOUTH + Path.EAST Path.SOUTH +
 * Path.WEST
 * <P>
 * The connected object in the first block is usually a track segment. This
 * track segment is connected to an object in the second block. The connection
 * point in the second block can be either one end of a track segment, or one of
 * the connection points on a turnout, or one of the connection points on a
 * level crossing. The allowed values for the connection points at the second
 * block are defined in LayoutEditor.
 * <P>
 * The exception to the above is when a crossover turnout has multiple blocks.
 * If so, at least one block boundary is internal to the crossover turnout. Such
 * cases are handled differently, as "crossover block boundary types", see
 * definition of the type codes below. The first letter in the boundary type
 * corresponds to the first block, and the second letter corresponds to the
 * second block. All four block boundaries are possible for the double
 * crossover. One of the crossed over boundaries is not possible with each
 * single crossover.
 * <P>
 * Note that each LayoutEditor panel has its own list of LayoutConnectivity
 * objects, nominally called its "block connectivity". In contrast, there is
 * only one set of LayoutBlocks, Blocks, and Paths, which are used by all
 * LayoutEditor panels.
 * <P>
