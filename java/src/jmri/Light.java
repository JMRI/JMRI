/**
 * Represent a single visible Light on the physical layout.
 * <p>
 * Each Light may have one or more control mechanisms. Control mechanism types
 * are defined here. If a Light has any controls, the information is contained
 * in LightControl objects, which are referenced via that Light.
 * <p>
 * Lights have a state and an intensity.
 * <p>
 * The intensity of the hardware output is represented by the range from 0.0 to
 * 1.0, with 1.0 being brightest.
 * <p>
 * The primary states are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>ON, corresponding to maximum intensity
 * <LI>INTERMEDIATE, some value between maximum and minimum
 * <li>OFF, corresponding to minimum intensity
 * </ul>
 * The underlying hardware may provide just the ON/OFF two levels, or have a
 * semi-continuous intensity setting with some number of steps.
 * <p>
 * The light has a TargetIntensity property which can be set directly. In
 * addition, it has a CurrentIntensity property which may differ from
 * TargetIntensity while the Light is being moved from one intensity to another.
 * <p>
 * Intensity is limited by MinIntensity and MaxIntensity parameters. Setting the
 * state to ON sets the TargetIntensity to MinIntensity, and to OFF sets the
 * TargetIntensity to MaxIntensity. Attempting to directly set the
 * TargetIntensity outside the values of MinIntensity and MaxIntensity
 * (inclusive) will result in the TargetIntensity being set to the relevant
 * limit.
 * <p>
 * Because the actual light hardware has only finite resolution, the intensity
 * value is mapped to the nearest setting. For example, in the special case of a
 * two-state (on/off) Light, setting a TargetIntensity of more than 0.5 will
 * turn the Light on, less than 0.5 will turn the light off.
 * <p>
 * Specific implementations will describe how the settings map to the particular
 * hardware commands.
 * <p>
 * The transition rate is absolute; the intensity changes at a constant rate
 * regardless of whether the change is a big one or a small one.
