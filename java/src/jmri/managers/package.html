        Provides implementations of various JMRI managers.

        <p>
            As a long term project, we're moving various Abstract* and Default*
            managers out of the {@link jmri} package itself, and moved 
            into here. In the meantime, you'll find many of them still in 
            {@link jmri}.

        <p>
            Implementations of individual object interfaces are
            found in the {@link jmri.implementation} package.

            <!-- Put @see and @since tags down here. -->
            @see jmri.implementation
            @since 2.5.3
