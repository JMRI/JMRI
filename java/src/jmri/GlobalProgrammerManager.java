/**
 * Get access to available {@link Programmer} objects.
 * <P>
 * Programmers come in two types:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Global, previously Service Mode, e.g. on a programming track. Request
 * these from an instance of this interface.
 * <LI>Addressed, previously Ops Mode, e.g. "programming on the main". Request
 * these from an instance of {@link AddressedProgrammerManager}.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * This interface also provides a reserve/release system for tools that want to
 * pretend they have exclusive use of a Programmer. This is a cooperative
 * reservation; both tools (first and second reserver) must be using the
 * reserve/release interface.
