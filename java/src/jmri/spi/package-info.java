/**
 * Interfaces that can be implemented outside the JMRI.jar file to implement new
 * behavior in JMRI.
 *
 * Implementing classes need to be included in the containing JAR's
 * META-INF.services directory per the Java Service Provider Interface (SPI)
 * standards.
 *
 * The {@link JmriServiceProviderInterface} interface serves to identify the
 * semantics of being a JMRI-specific SPI.
 *
 * Within the JMRI code, it is possible to use
 * {@code @org.openide.util.lookup.ServiceProvider(service = INTERFACE)}
 * just before the class declaration to have the class automatically included in
 * the JAR's META-INF.services directory, where INTERFACE is the interface to be
 * implemented.
