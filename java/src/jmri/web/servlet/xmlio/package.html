<strong>The JMRI XML I/O protocol is deprecated and will be removed during the JMRI 3.11 development cycle.</strong><p>

This package provides a Servlet implementation of the 
JMRI XML I/O protocol. The XML format is described by 
<a href="http://jmri.org/xml/schema/xmlio.xsd">its XML Schema</a> document.
For more information, see the 
{@link jmri.web.xmlio} package.

<p>
If a &lt;list&gt; or &lt;throttle&gt; element is present,
an immediate operation is used so the result can be returned.
Otherwise, a deferred operation is used, returning
the result only when one of the indicated beans has changed
it's value.

<p>
Both GET and POST operations are supported.
