/**
 * A Transit is a group of Sections representing a specified path through a
 * layout.
 * <p>
 * A Transit may have the following states:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>IDLE</dt>
 * <dd>available for assignment to a train</dd>
 * <dt>ASSIGNED</dt>
 * <dd>linked to a train in an {@link jmri.jmrit.dispatcher.ActiveTrain}</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * When assigned to a Transit, options may be set for the assigned Section. The
 * Section and its options are kept in a {@link jmri.TransitSection} object.
 * <p>
 * To accommodate passing sidings and other track features, there may be
 * multiple Sections connecting two other Sections in a Transit. If so, one
 * Section is assigned as primary, and the other connecting Sections are
 * assigned as alternates.
 * <p>
 * A Section may be in a Transit more than once, for example if a train is to
 * make two or more loops around a layout before going elsewhere.
 * <p>
 * A Transit is normally traversed in the forward direction, that is, the
 * direction of increasing Section Numbers. When a Transit traversal is started
 * up, it is always started in the forward direction. However, to accommodate
 * point-to-point (back and forth) route designs, the direction of travel in a
 * Transit may be "reversed". While the Transit direction is "reversed", the
 * direction of travel is the direction of decreasing Section numbers. Whether a
 * Transit is in the "reversed" direction is kept in the ActiveTrain using the
 * Transit.
