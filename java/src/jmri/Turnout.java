/**
 * Represent a Turnout on the layout.
 * <p>
 * A Turnout has two states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The "commandedState" records the state that's been commanded in the
 * program. It might take some time, perhaps a long time, for that to actually
 * take effect.
 * <li>The "knownState" is the program's best idea of the actual state on the
 * the layout.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are a number of reasons that commandedState and knownState differ:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A change has been commanded, but it hasn't had time to happen yet
 * <li>Something has gone wrong, and a commanded change isn't actually going to
 * happen
 * <li>Although the program hasn't commanded a change, something on the layout
 * has made the turnout change. This could be a local electrical button, a
 * mechanical movement of the points, or something else.
 * <li>For a bus-like system, e.g. LocoNet or XpressNet, some other device might
 * have sent a command to change the turnout.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Turnout feedback is involved in the connection between these two states; for
 * more information see the
 * <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TurnoutFeedback.shtml">feedback
 * page</a>.
 * <p>
 * The AbstractTurnout class contains a basic implementation of the state and
 * messaging code, and forms a useful start for a system-specific
 * implementation. Specific implementations, e.g. for
 * LocoNet and NCE, will convert to and from the layout commands.
 * <p>
 * The states and names are Java Bean parameters, so that listeners can be
 * registered to be notified of any changes.
 * <p>
 * A sample use of the Turnout interface can be seen in the
 * jmri.jmrit.simpleturnoutctrl.SimpleTurnoutCtrlFrame class, which provides a
 * simple GUI for controlling a single turnout.
 * <p>
 * Each Turnout object has a two names. The "user" name is entirely free form,
 * and can be used for any purpose. The "system" name is provided by the
 * system-specific implementations, and provides a unique mapping to the layout
 * control system (for example LocoNet or NCE) and address within that system.
 * <p>
 * Turnouts exhibit some complex behaviors. At the same time, they are sometimes
 * used as generic binary outputs where those get in the way. Eventually, we
 * need to have a separate e.g. Output class, but for now you can defeat much of
 * the advanced behaviors with the setBinaryOutput(true) method. This is a
 * configuration property; changing it on the fly may give unexpected results.
 * It's value is not persisted.
