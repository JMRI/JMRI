        JMRI consists of the jmri package of basic interfaces,
        the jmri.jmrix package of external layout interfaces,
        the jmri.jmrit package of system-independent tools,
        plus various utility and test packages.
        <P>
            The primary JMRI concepts are defined by interfaces in the
            {@link jmri} package.  Objects such as 
            {@link jmri.Turnout Turnouts},
            {@link jmri.Sensor Sensors}, and
            {@link jmri.SignalHead SignalHeads} can be directly manipulated
            as analogs of items on the layout.
        <P>
            To get access to these objects, you ask for them 
            from a manager, e.g. a
            {@link jmri.TurnoutManager}.
            The manager can provide an existing object, or 
            create a new one of the needed concrete type.
        <P>
            To find the managers, you start with the 
            static members in the 
            {@link jmri.InstanceManager} class.
