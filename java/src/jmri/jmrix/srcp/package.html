        Provide a JMRI connection to an 
        <a href="http://srcpd.sourceforge.net/">SRCP server</a>.

        <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>

        Every SRCP message or reply ends in a 0x0A character, which is
        an "\n" character in Java. These have to be explicitly added to 
        messages when they are created.

        <h2>Notes</h2>

        Made from the EasyDCC base, so look there for 
        e.g. the Consist and ConsistManager classes when needed.
