This package holds objects specific to the RFID stand-alone readers that
use the <a href="http://www.parallax.com/sites/default/files/downloads/28140-28340-RFID-Reader-Documentation-v2.2.pdf">Parallax protocol.</a>
<p>
As this protocol is uni-directional, the specific Reporters and Sensors incorporate
a time-out technique as opposed to being explicitly de-activated.
