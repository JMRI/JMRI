        This package holds objects specific to the RFID stand-alone readers that
        use an Olimex protocol.
        <p>
            As this protocol is uni-directional, the specific Reporters and Sensors incorporate
            a time-out technique as opposed to being explicitly de-activated.
        <p>
            Be sure to set the correct reader model in the connection profile.  Current 
            support is for the following readers which each uses a slightly different protocol:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/RFID/MOD-RFID125/resources/MOD-RFID125.pdf">Olimex MOD-RFID125 </a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.olimex.com/wiki/MOD-RFID1356MIFARE">Olimex MOD-RFID1356MIFARE</a> (as of JMRI version 4.9.4)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Support for these readers assumes that the reader is in "CDC" mode.  This 
            reader mode is typically configured using a pushbutton on the reader.
        <p>
            Note that the console may show a pair of "Timeout" warnings from 
            jmrix.AbstractMrTrafficController when the RFID device is initialized.
            This is expected behavior. 
        <p>
