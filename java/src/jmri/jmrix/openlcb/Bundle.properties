TurnoutThrownEventName = Turnout {0} Thrown
TurnoutClosedEventName = Turnout {0} Closed
SensorActiveEventName = Sensor {0} Active
SensorInactiveEventName = Sensor {0} Inactive

OlcbStateAuthHeader = Authoritative
OlcbStateAuthToolTip = Sets whether an OpenLCB object should respond to state inquiry messages. \
  When unticked, all reports will contain UNKNOWN state. Helpful to \
  untick when there is hardware that keeps authoritative state.
OlcbStateListenHeader = Always listen
OlcbStateListenToolTip = If ticked, all state reports will update local state. If unticked, state \
  reports will update local state only if local state is UNKNOWN. State change messages (Event \
  Reports) always change local state. Might be helpful to untick if the state flip-flops multiple \
  times after a query, which means that the event does not have a consistent distributed state.
