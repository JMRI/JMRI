        Provides JMRI implementations for Wangrow DCC systems.

        <P>
            This is a close relative of the NCE support.  So long
            as those two use the same command set, etc, the Wangrow
            communications can be handled by the NCE classes.  So
            Some of the classes in this package reference
            classes in the {@link jmri.jmrix.nce} package.
