        This package handles communications for the ProTrak Grapevine hardware.
        <p>
            Note that the zero Grapevine address is used for error
            messages, and does not correspond to a node.  The nodes
            have addresses 1 through 127. These are mapped to e.g. GT1 through GT126001
            for their first outputs.

        <h2>TODO</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>SerialLight needs to be updated to work; see SerialTurnout for communications
            <li>Add a tool to check for existing nodes by requesting software version
            <li>Add a tool to change a node address?
            <li>Automatically create a SerialNode if a message from an unknown address arrives?
            <li>Update the node type based on info received in response to software version message
            <li>Error handling/reporting - start by capturing address 0 messages
            <li>setOutputBit() should be removed (in SerialLight, among other places)
        </ul>
