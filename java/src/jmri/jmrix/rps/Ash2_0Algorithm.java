/**
 * Implementation of 2nd algorithm for reducing Readings
 * <P>
 * This algorithm was provided by Robert Ashenfelter based in part on the work
 * of Ralph Bucher in his paper "Exact Solution for Three Dimensional Hyperbolic
 * Positioning Algorithm and Synthesizable VHDL Model for Hardware
 * Implementation".
 * <P>
 * Neither Ashenfelter nor Bucher provide any guarantee as to the intellectual
 * property status of this algorithm. Use it at your own risk.
 *
 *
 * Here is a summary of the features of the new program from Robert Ashenfelter:
 *
 * <OL>
 * <LI> It is completely iterative. No more exact solutions for sets of three
 * receivers. No more weighted averages of such solutions.
 *
 * <LI> Although both the old and the new versions can accept an unlimited
 * number of receivers, the old version only processes a maximum of 15 while the
 * new version processes up to 50.
 *
 * <LI> The accuracy of the new version is approximately the same as for the old
 * version, perhaps marginally better. However for more than 15 receivers it is
 * significantly better.
 *
 * <LI> It has been designed to specifically reject receiver measurements with
 * gross errors, i.e. those which are so large that there is no possible
 * position solution when they are combined with other measurements. It does so
 * much better than version 1.1. (However, version 1.1 has deficiencies in this
 * regard and is not as good at this as version 1.0.)
 *
 * <LI> It is slightly faster.
 * </OL>
 *
 * Here is a description of the new program.
 * <P>
 * As before the first thing it does is sort the receivers in order of
 * increasing time delay, discarding those that failed or are too far or too
 * near, and using the closest ones. There is a maximum that are used, now set
 * at 50.
 * <P>
 * Next it discards those receivers with gross measurement errors. All possible
 * pairs of receivers are checked to see if the sum of their measured ranges is
 * less than, or the difference is greater than, the distance between the
 * receivers. Counts are maintained for each receiver and the one with the
 * largest count is booted out. The proceedure is repeated until there are no
 * more failures. If fewer than three receivers are left there can be no
 * solution and an error code is returned.
 * <P>
 * Two iterative techniques are used which I call "One-At-A-Time" and
 * "All-Together." The first looks at one receiver at a time and moves the
 * estimated position directly toward or away from it such that the distance is
 * equal to the measured value. This simple technique usually converges quite
 * rapidly. The second technique accumulates the adjustments for all receivers
 * and then computes and applies an average for all. It is not as fast but is
 * ultimately more accurate.
 * <P>
 * The solution proceeds in four stages, the first two of which are like the
 * preliminary solution in version 1.1. Stage 0 does 50 One-At-A-Time iterations
 * with the receivers in the sorted order. As in version 1.1, it starts from a
 * position far, far below any likely final point. Stage 1 continues with the
 * receivers chosen at random until it has iterated 1000 times. The procedure
 * usually converges in 20-50 iterations, however for occasional positions the
 * convergence is much slower. The random order is used because the procedure
 * was occasionally observed to get stuck in a loop when using a repetitive
 * fixed order.
 * <P>
 * Stage 2 continues the One-At-A-Time technique for an additional 250
 * iterations with the receivers in reverse order ending with the closest
 * receiver. Weights are applied assuming that close measurements are more
 * accurate than distant ones. The weights fade out during the stage so that at
 * the end the adjustments are very small. This fade-out fixes a problem with
 * the One-At-A-Time technique in that it gives undue weight to the last
 * receiver. The result at this point is quite good and the program could well
 * stop here but it doesn't. Stage 3 runs the All-Together iteration 15 times,
 * also using weights according to distance, to produce a more refined result.
 * <P>
 * The program always runs through all the iterations regardless of how fast or
 * slow the solution converges. Only at the end does it compute the variance of
 * the residuals (differences between measured receiver distances and those from
 * the computed position) to check the result. The execution time ranges from
 * 0.8 millisecond with 3 receivers to 1.3 millisecond with 50 or more receivers
 * (1.0 GHz Pentium III).
 * <P>
 * Input/output is the same as for versions 1.0 and 1.1. As before, the function
 * returns 0 if all seems well and 1 if there are fewer than 3 usable receivers
 * (with the reported position outside the known universe). A return value of 2
 * indicates that the variance of the residuals exceeds a fixed threshold so the
 * reported position is questionable. The threshold is set at 30 microseconds
 * which is equivalent to a standard deviation of 0.4 inch or 1.0 cm. This is
 * about as small as I dare set it. Usually the reported position is garbage
 * (because of errors in the input data) when the return value is 2, but it
 * could be close if the input is merely excessively noisy. Likewise, the
 * reported position is usally OK when the return value is 0 but this cannot be
 * guaranteed. After all, errors in the data could happen to mimic good values
 * for a wrong position. These return values tend to less reliable when the
 * program is overloaded with too many large errors.
 * <P>
 * The restrictions on the configuration of transmitters and receivers,
 * necessary to prevent the program from reporting a spurious position, are the
 * same as those for version 1.1.
 * <P>
 * As before, I have tested the program with a large number of different
 * receiver configurations having from 3 to 100 receivers and with many
 * transmitter locations. In addition to small random measurement errors, I have
 * added the simulation of large errors to the tests. To simulate such an error,
 * I pick a random receiver and replace its time delay with a random value
 * between 0 and 35,000 microseconds (equivalent to 0 to 40 feet). Depending on
 * the configuration, this may result in a gross error or the error may be too
 * small for this but still so large as to cause the solution to fail. Some
 * results for four receivers and one large error are that with Larry's small
 * initial test layout the program rejects the error and computes a correct
 * position 90% of the time, while with a more-typical layout it may be only
 * 50%. Performance improves to 80% correct for the typical layout with six
 * receivers.
