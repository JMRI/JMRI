        Interfaces and implementations for system-specific code.

        <P>
            This package provides a few interfaces and abstract implementations
            for the system-specific code, and serves as the parent
            to the system-specific packages. 
        <P>
            We intend that this will still compile and run with
            any of the system-specific subpackages missing. And that
            might even work.

        <P>
            Most of the system specific code is organized as follows:
        <ul>
            <LI>PortController classes handle the connection to the serial
                port or other communications link.
                That code is usually in the "SsssPortController"
                class in the "ssss.serialdriver" package
            <LI>TrafficController classes handle the sequencing and scheduling
                of messages and replies through a port. The intention is that
                a particular system use one (or few) traffic controllers
                with perhaps multiple port controllers for different connections
            <LI>System-specific tools are generally given their own sub-package
                under the system package
        </ul>
