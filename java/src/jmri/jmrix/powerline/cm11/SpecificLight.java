/**
 * Implementation of the Light Object for X10 CM11 interfaces.
 * <P>
 * Uses X10 dimming commands to set intensity unless the value is 0.0 or 1.0, in
 * which case it uses on/off commands only.
 * <p>
 * Since the dim/bright step of the hardware is unknown then the Light object is
 * first created, the first time the intensity (not state) is set to other than
 * 0.0 or 1.0, the output is run to it's maximum dim or bright step so that we
 * know the count is right.
 * <p>
 * Keeps track of the controller's "dim count", and if not certain forces it to
 * zero to be sure.
