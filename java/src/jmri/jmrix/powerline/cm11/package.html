        <h2>To Do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The 0x00 that's send as part of the interlocking doesn't show
                in the serial monitor
            <li>The clock setting is way too simple, see setClock in CM11AGateway.
                Also, does that have the right house code handling?  Can the interface handle 
                more than one house code?
            <li>No provision for e.g. a CM10, with it's slightly separate codes.
        </ul>
