        This package handles communications for powerline adapters, such as X10.

        <p>
            The package structure has to take two kinds of variation into account:
        <ol>
            <li>Multiple adapters, e.g. as shown on the
                <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/powerline/Compatibility.shtml">compatibility page</a>.
                Each of these has its own serial protocol, including its own message format.
            <li>Multiple device families and types, starting with X10, but later including
                Insteon and perhaps others.  Individual adapters might support one or several of these.
        </ol>

        <p>
            Our strategy is to use explicit interfaces for each device protocol, implemented
            by a polymorphic TrafficController for each adapter type.
        <p>
            For example, the primary 
            {@link jmri.jmrix.powerline.SerialTrafficController}
            abstract class has an interface for sending 
            {@link jmri.jmrix.powerline.X10Sequence} objects.  
            An {@link jmri.jmrix.powerline.X10Sequence} encapulates just the X10 commands, not
            the particular message needed to send them.  
            When the {@link jmri.jmrix.powerline.X10Sequence} is passed
            to the specific SerialTrafficController implementation, 
            e.g. {@link jmri.jmrix.powerline.cm11.SpecificTrafficController},
            it's encapsulated in one or more {@link jmri.jmrix.powerline.cm11.SpecificMessage}
            objects, queued and sent.

        <p>
            The setup is done in 
            {@link jmri.jmrix.powerline.serialdriver.SerialDriverAdapter}, which keys off the 
            adapter name in option1.
