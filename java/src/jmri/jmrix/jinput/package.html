        Access to USB input devices via JInput.

        <P>
            This package uses the JInput library
            to access input devices attached via USB, 
            and map them to inputs (Sensors and Reporters)
            in JMRI.

        <p>
            The {@link jmri.jmrix.jinput.treecontrol} subpackage provides a GUI for watching 
            and controlling operation.

        <p>
            For background on JInput, see their
            <a href="https://static.javadoc.io/net.java.jinput/jinput/2.0.7/net/java/games/input/package-summary.html">Javadoc page</a>.
            Note that are environment variables that control how 
            plugins are found.  
            Pre-2019 versions of JMRI routinely defined
            <br>
            <code>jinput.plugins=net.bobis.jinput.hidraw.HidRawEnvironmentPlugin</code>
            <br>
            to load a 32-bit only library needed for some early hardware. 
            Due to how JInput handles errors, this was very verbose when
            run in CI where the servers weren't compatible with the shipped library,
            so that definition has been partially removed.
        <p>

            @since 2.1.5
