        Defines classes for interfacing to a MERG CBUS network.

        <p>
            More information on the protocols is available on the

        <h3>A note on terminology</h3>

        CBUS refers to a 7-bit field in the standard CAN header 
        as the "ID", "Node ID", and "CAN ID", 
        but occasionally refers to the entire 11-bit CAN header by the same names.
        <p>
            The JMRI classes use "cbusId" to refer to the 7-bit field.
