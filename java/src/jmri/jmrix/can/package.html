        Defines classes for interfacing to a CAN-based model railway
        control bus.

        <p>
            It is expected that there will be multiple CAN implementations (e.g. MERG
            CBUS, ATBUS, etc) each accessible through a variety of CAN adapters (e.g. 
            CAN232 or MERG CAN-RS), but that each implementation will be based uppon
            basic CANbus concepts such as header (standard or extended), Normal and RTR
            frames and a data field.

        <p>
            This package is therefore organized in several subtrees:
        <dl>
            <dt>adapters
            <dd>Specific implementations for CAN adapter hardware, e.g. 
                <a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/resources/lcb.html">MERG</a>'s <a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/resources/lcb.html#CAN_RS">CAN_RS</a>; 
                <a href="http://canusb.com/">LAWICEL AB</a>'s <a href="http://canusb.com/">CANUSB and CAN232</a>; etc.
            <dt>protocols
            <dd>Specific implementations for e.g. CBUS, NmraNet, etc:
                <ul>
                    <li>cbus - MERG CBUS
                    <li>atbus - ATBUS
                    <li>nmranet - NMRA NMRAnet (not yet present)
                </ul>
            <dt>swing
            <dd>Swing-based GUI tools. 
        </dl>

        <!-- @see jmri.InstanceManager -->

        <h3>A note on terminology</h3>

        CBUS refers to a 7-bit field in the standard CAN header 
        as the "ID", "Node ID", and "CAN ID", 
        but occasionally refers to the entire 11-bit CAN header by the same names.
        <p>
            The JMRI classes use "cbusId" to refer to the 7-bit field.

            @since 2.1.7
