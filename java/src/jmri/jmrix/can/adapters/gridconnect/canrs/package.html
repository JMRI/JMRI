        Defines classes for interfacing to a MERG CAN-RS 
        or CAN-USB adapter.

            This is similar to the basic GridConnect support
            found in the parent jmri.jmrix.can.adapter.gridconnect
            package, which is connected with a serial adapter in the
            jmri.jmrix.can.adapter.GridConnect.canusb package.
