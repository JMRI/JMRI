/**
 * Mx1Interface defines the general connection to a MX-1 layout.
 * <P>
 * Use this interface to send messages to a MX-1 layout. Classes implementing
 * the Mx1Listener interface can register here to receive incoming MX-1 messages
 * as events.
 * <P>
 * The jmri.jrmix.zimo.Mx1TrafficManager provides the first implementation of
 * this interface.
 * <P>
 * How do you locate an implemenation of this interface? That's an interesting
 * question. This is inherently MX-1 specific, so it would be inappropriate to
 * put it in the jmri.InterfaceManager. And Java interfaces can't have static
 * members, so we can't provide an implementation() member. For now, we use a
 * static implementation member in the Mx1TrafficManager implementation to
 * locate _any_ implementation; this clearly needs to be improved.
 * <P>
 * Mx1Listener implementations registering for traffic updates cannot assume
 * that messages will be returned in any particular thread. See the Mx1Listener
 * doc for more background.
