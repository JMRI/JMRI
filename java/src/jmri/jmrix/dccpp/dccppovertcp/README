This is the README file for the jmrix.dccpp.dccppovertcp package.

The jmrix Java package defines implementations for the JMRI interfaces. 
jmrix.dccpp.dccppovertcp defines classes for interfacing to a DCC++ base station
via a telnet connection to a DCCppOverTcp driver.  This essentially makes a
host instance of JMRI a network bridge for a (presumably) serial attached
DCC++ base station so that a remote client instance of JMRI can use that base
station.

This should also allow MULTIPLE JMRI client instances to share a single DCC++
base station via a single host instance of JMRI (which can also use the DCC++
base station).
