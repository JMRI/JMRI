# Tool Tips
ToolTipGroupName = Group Channel Name is a name of 1 to 8 characters.
ToolTipGroupChannel = Group Channel Number must be a whole number between 11 and 26.
ToolTipGroupPassword = Group Password must be a four-digit whole number between 0000 and 9999. Some hardware may also allow use of characters A-C.

ErrorBadGroupChannel = Group Channel Number must be a whole number between 11 and 26 (inclusive).
ErrorBadGroupPassword = Group Password must be 4 characters, typically the digits 0 thru 9. Some hardware may also accept letters A, B, and C.
ErrorBadGroupId = Group ID Number must be a whole number between 0 and 127 (inclusive).
ErrorGroupMismatch = One or more UR92 does not match the info shown above.
ErrorNoUR92Found = No UR92 found.  Nothing to configure.
ErrorNoQueryResponse = Did not receive any Duplex group info.
ErrorReadingTooSoon = Please wait - tool is already attempting to read Duplex information.

# FixedLinesForStatus is a constant used to allocate space for displaying status
# lines in the GUI.
# If this constant is too small, then any status message could be too long for
# the available display space, and the GUI may display only part of the
# message.  As an example, for one combination of machine, JAVA
# Runtime-environment, and /Look-and-feel setting, the beginning of the message
# was not shown and only those portions of the tail of the string which would
# fit in the available number of GUI lines were displayed.
