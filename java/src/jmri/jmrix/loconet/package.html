        Provides access to LocoNet systems, along with a lot of Swing-based tools.

        <h2>Initialization Sequence</h2>

        This section describes the LocoNet implementation of the new (2010)
        configuration system.

        <ol>
            <li>jmri.jmrix.loconet.NN.configurexml.ConnectionConfigXml is invoked 
                by the configurexml when the specific class is named in an XML
                input file.

            <li>It is a child of the jmri.jmrix.configurexml.AbstractConnectionConfigXml, 
                which invokes the getInstance() method of it (not a static
                method) in its load() method 
                to load the "adapter" member variable with a 
                specific *Adapter class, e.g. MS100Adapter.

            <li>More importantly, that getInstance()

            <li>Later, after the port is (hopefully) up,
                AbstractConnectionConfigXml invokes the Adapter's 
                configure() method.

            <li>That Adapter configure() method does, in order:
                <ol>
                    <li>sets up Packetizer/port/etc as needed
                    <li>configureCommandStation() from LnPortController
                    <li>configureManagers() from LnPortController,
                        but overridden in e.g. PR3Adapter.
                    <li>does any other initialization of it's own, e.g. startThreads()
                        <p>
                            At this point, the system is basically up and ready for operation.

                    <li>Finally, a jmri.jmrix.loconet.LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo object is
                        created and registered with the InstanceManager.

                </ol>

            <li>Later, jmri.jmrix.ActiveSystemsMenu
                wants to create user menus, and finds the LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo
                object in the InstanceManager

            <li>The menu code asks that specific SystemConnectionMemo object
                to create and return the menu.  It does so, in the process
                connecting each Action to itself so that the individual tools
                will be able to connect to the proper e.g. TrafficController, 
                SlotMonitor, etc.

            <li>When an Action is fired later on, the invoked class(es) enquire
                of the LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo when they need a resource, 
                instead of referring to an instance() method in the 
                resource's class.

        </ol>

        To adapt a type, e.g. Turnout:
        <ol>
            <li>Basic manager needs to have getSystemPrefix in addition to letter
            <li>ProxyManager has to check for system prefix, not letter

        </ol>
