The jmrix.loconet Java package defines loconet-specific implementations 
for the JMRI interfaces.  The jmrix.loconet.locormi package implements
remote communication between a "LocoNet server" and a "LocoNet client"
process.

The JMRI web page is located at http://jmri.org/

This package is the work of Alex Shepherd.
