        Provide GUI tools for editing an SDF file in memory.

        <p>
            The text for each of the editor panels comes from the
            "Explanations" properties set (see the Explanations.properties file 
            in this package and its 
            translations).  The editors themselves are coded as subclasses
            of {@link jmri.jmrix.loconet.sdfeditor.SdfMacroEditor}, one per instruction type.
        <p>
            The line in the tree (left-side window) is from the
            toString method of the 
            {@link jmri.jmrix.loconet.sdf.SdfMacro} object.

        <p>
            Note that the editor is "live"; changing an option on an editor
            window changes the memory version of the instruction, including the 
            disassembled version.

        The SDF information is manipulated using the 
        {@link jmri.jmrix.loconet.sdf}
        package.
