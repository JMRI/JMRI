# {2} is a string representing the device's operating mode

# {4} is the "starting address" of the device's primary object group, which may
#   map to switch addresses (as implied on the DT602 display), and/or general

#   additional objects of different type.  Where different "object" types are

#   implements Sw9, Sw10, Sw11, and Sw12, but _not_ Sw13 as implied by the
