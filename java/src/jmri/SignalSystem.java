 * A SignalSystem defines a signaling system by representing the properties of

 * <p>
 * At present, the signal aspects are enumerated by Strings, not by specific
 * objects; this table exists to attach properties to those Strings.
 * <p>
 * Setting or getting the "state" of one of these will throw an error.
 * <p>
 * You'll have one of these objects for each signaling _system_ on your
 * railroad. In turn, these will be used by 1 to N specific mappings to
 * appearances, see e.g. {@link jmri.SignalAppearanceMap}.
 * <p>
 * Insertion order is preserved when retrieving keys.
