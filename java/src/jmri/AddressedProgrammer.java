/**
 * Provide access to the hardware DCC decoder programming capability.
 * <p>
 * Programmers come in multiple types:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Global, previously "Service Mode" or on a programming track
 * <li>Addressed, previously "Ops Mode" also known as "programming on the main"
 * </ul>
 * Different equipment may also require different programmers:
 * <ul>
 * <li>DCC CV programming, on service mode track or on the main
 * <li>CBUS Node Variable programmers
 * <li>LocoNet System Variable programmers
 * <li>LocoNet Op Switch programmers
 * <li>etc
 * </ul>
 * Depending on which type you have, only certain modes can be set. Valid modes
 * are specified by the class static constants.
 * <p>
 * You get a Programmer object from an {@link AddressedProgrammerManager}, which
 * in turn can be located from the {@link InstanceManager}.
 * <p>
 * Starting in JMRI 3.5.5, the CV addresses are Strings for generality. The
 * methods that use ints for CV addresses will later be deprecated.
