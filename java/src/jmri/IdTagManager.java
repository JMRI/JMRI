/**
 * Locate an IdTag object representing a specific IdTag.
 * <P>
 * IdTag objects are obtained from an IdTagManager, which in turn is generally
 * located from the InstanceManager. A typical call sequence might be:
 * <PRE>
 * IdTag tag = InstanceManager.idTagManagerInstance().newIdTag(null,"23");
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * Each IdTag has a two names. The "user" name is entirely free form, and can be
 * used for any purpose. The "system" name is provided by the system-specific
 * implementations, and provides a unique mapping to the layout control system
 * (for example LocoNet or NCE) and address within that system.
 * <P>
 * Much of the book-keeping is implemented in the AbstractIdTagManager class,
 * which can form the basis for a system-specific implementation.
