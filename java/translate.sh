# Assumes that the program is being run from the "java" build directory.
# Do "ant debug" first to copy files into the classes directory
#
# To test your code, use the "ant locale" target to run PanelPro and look for
# strings that are not in upper case.

# Limitations:
# 1) This doesn't really translate to Klingon, though that would be really cool.
# 2) Insertion keys, e.g. {0}, are not preserved in the strings.

# Make list of properties classes, removing a couple that are intended not for translation

| grep -v jmri/web/server/FilePaths.properties`
